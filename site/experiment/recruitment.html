    Members of Goldsmiths, University of London are cordially invited to take part in an online experiment designed to understand 
    the reading and writing of individuals based on terms presented via various visualization and text representation which is automatically 
    extracted from an NLP corpus. Participants need to perform reading and writing based on presented terms and documents. Based on the 
    engagement and manual input from the participants, this study will attempt to identify the cognitive importance of terms visualization 
    in developing a story plan for better writing.
    </p>
    <p>
    We are aiming to recruit the first 32 participants for this rewarded

    <h3 class="w3-center">Tasks</h3>
    <p>
        The tasks of this experiment are designed to understand reading and writing activity by human intelligence 
        based on the provided information. You have to do tasks in the given order. There will be 6 tasks in 4 sets 
        (A, B, C and D). The order of the task sets is A, B, C and D. In each set, you have to follow the order of 
        the given individual tasks. You should complete all 6 tasks during the session. Tasks in sets A and B will 
        either have visualization or text followed by a set of questions. You need to provide the answers based on 
        the given information on the page. The task in sets C and D will have a list of documents. One of the sets 
        will have additional visualization. You need to read the provided information to write a story about the given 
        topic. For each task in sets A and B, we advise you to spend approximately 10 mins. For each task in sets C and D, 
        we advise spending approximately 20 mins.

    <h3 class="w3-center">What is the purpose of the study?</h3>
   	<p>This study is performed under a PhD research project. 
    <ul>
        <li>This project is aiming to understand how the story plan/rhetoric of an author is preserved in structured news or article. Understanding the story plan of an existing document not only helps to generate abstract summarization but also helps to understand the author's rhetoric. If we can automatically identify rhetoric, we can identify areas of thought easily in a massive corpus that can aid in generating creative ideas in a specific topic area.</li>
        <li>This project also generates automatic terms board based on extracted terms to provide cognitive guidance to authors to form a story plan and to write a story/report about the given topic.</li>
        <li>This research has the potential to bridge the gap between NLP terms extraction and cognitive reading and writing tasks via comprehensive data visualization to improve idea generation in research and editorial context.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Why have I been invited to participate?</h3>
    <p>
        Reading and writing are inevitable parts of learning in academic life. Any tools based on research archives that improve students’ creativity and learning experience can become an essential part of online education. Therefore, members of the university are invited to take part in this study.
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Do I have to take part?</h3>
    <p>
        Taking part in the research is entirely voluntary. This is going to be a 2 hours online experiment session. It is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to do so, you will be given this information sheet to keep and will be asked to give your consent. Neither refusal to participate nor withdrawal will have any impact on marks. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Can I withdraw from the study?</h3>
    <p>
        As it is a rewarded experiment, you can withdraw any time before your experiment session is started. This experiment is collecting anonymized data that can no longer be removed from the study. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">What will happen if I take part?</h3>
    <p>
        Based on first come first serve, we will be recruiting 32 students. On request, based on available places, a confirmation email will be sent to you. The online session will be performed via Google Meet. You need a laptop with a Chrome browser to participate in this experiment. You need to present your screen in Google Meet for the researcher to observe reading and writing activities. Any recording will not be performed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        During the online session, you will be given a brief about the experiment tasks. After the brief, you will get 5 mins to do a trial run and ask any questions about the tasks. After the trial time, you will be given a user code and you need to register your user code on the experiment's online site. Then you can open the tasks page. You will be given 6 tasks. You need to perform all 6 tasks following the given order. We will also recommend the approximate time we intend you to spend per task. But this is not a strict constraint. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After the tasks, the research will be validating recorded data and a reward of 20 pounds will be rewarded to you via online service. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
    <p>
    The data collected during the session is extremely valuable for understanding reading and writing tasks in an NLP corpus. Your participation is a contribution to the related research field. As it is a rewarded experiment, an online voucher of 20 pounds will be gifted after the experiment session. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Will, what I say in this study be kept confidential?</h3>
    <p>
    All user information and consent forms collected from the participants will be kept strictly confidential. These forms will be preserved in Goldsmiths OneDrive/Office 365 system. The user data we collect should be stored in a password-protected folder on One Drive. The collected information on the website is anonymized and will be preserved in Google Analytics and Dynamo Db Database in AWS. As the data is anonymous, it cannot be withdrawn after the session. Collected anonymous user data will be shared and published. The data collected during the study might be used for additional or subsequent research. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">What will happen to the results of the research study?</h3>
    <p>
    The result of this research will be published in relevant publications and will be presented in a PhD thesis.
