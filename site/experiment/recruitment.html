    Are you a teacher, student or staff in Goldsmiths, University of London? 
    We are cordially inviting you to take part in the <a href="https://storyanalysis.co.uk/experiment/recruitment.html">Story Analysis Online Experiment</a>. 
    Participants will perform reading comprehension and writing synthesis based on terms 
    presented via various visualizations and text representation which is automatically 
    extracted from a text archive. Taking part in the research is entirely voluntary. 
    It is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to do so, 
    please read the <a href="https://goldsmithscollege-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/isami001_campus_goldsmiths_ac_uk/EZZexoyp391PnQVsevgb-sUBpKX6RSRDXwC9ZtURfyfG1A" target="_blank">participant information sheet</a> and

    <h3 class="w3-center">What is the purpose of the study?</h3>
   	<p  class="w3-justify">
       This study is performed under a PhD research project titled "Unsupervised 
       contextual visualization of terms for understanding story planning in an NLP corpus".
    </p>

    <ul  class="w3-justify">
        <li>This project is aiming to understand documents from readers’ and writers’ perspectives.</li>
        <li>This project also generates automatic terms board based on extracted terms to provide cognitive guidance to individuals to form a plan for writing about the given topic.</li>
        <li>This research has the potential to bridge the gap between NLP terms extraction and cognitive reading and writing tasks via comprehensive data visualization to improve idea generation in research and editorial context.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Why have I been invited to participate?</h3>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
        Reading and writing are inevitable parts of learning in academic life. Any tools based on research archives that improve students’ creativity and learning experience can become an essential part of online education. Therefore, members of the university are invited to take part in this study.
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Do I have to take part?</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        Taking part in the research is entirely voluntary. This is going to be a 2 hours online experiment session. It is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to do so, you will be given this information sheet to keep and will be asked to give your consent. Neither refusal to participate nor withdrawal will have any impact on marks. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Can I withdraw from the study?</h3>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
        As it is a rewarded experiment, you can withdraw any time before your experiment session is started. This experiment is collecting anonymized data that can no longer be removed from the study. If you withdraw before finishing the given tasks, then you will no longer be eligible for the reward. 
        If you want to reschedule in case of an emergency then please contact us with your availability preferences (date & time).
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">What will happen if I take part?</h3>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
        Based on first come first serve, we will be recruiting 32 students. The online session will be performed via Google Meet. You need a laptop with a Chrome browser to participate in this experiment. You need to present your screen in Google Meet for the researcher to observe reading and writing activities. Any recording will not be performed. 
    </p>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
        During the online session, you will be given a brief about the experiment tasks. After the brief, you will get 5 mins to do a trial run and ask any questions about the tasks. After the trial time, you will be given a user code and you need to register your user code on the experiment's online site. Then you can open the tasks page. You will be given 6 tasks. You need to perform all 6 tasks following the given order. We will also recommend the approximate time we intend you to spend per task. But this is not a strict constraint. 
    </p>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
        After the tasks, the researcher will be validating recorded data and a reward of £20 will be rewarded to you via online service. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
    The data collected during the session is extremely valuable for understanding reading and writing tasks in an text archive. Your participation is a contribution to the related research field. As it is a rewarded experiment, an online voucher of £20 will be gifted after the experiment session. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">Will what I say in this study be kept confidential?</h3>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
    All user information and consent forms collected from the participants will be kept strictly confidential. These forms will be preserved in Goldsmiths OneDrive/Office 365 system. The user data we collect should be stored in a password-protected folder on One Drive. The collected information on the website is anonymized and will be preserved in Google Analytics and Dynamo Db Database in AWS. As the data is anonymous, it cannot be withdrawn after the session. Collected anonymous user data will be shared and published. The data collected during the study might be used for additional or subsequent research. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-center">What will happen to the results of the research study?</h3>
    <p  class="w3-justify">
    The result of this research will be published in relevant publications and will be presented in a PhD thesis.
