      Natural language is a means of communication that conveys authors’/speakers’ rhetoric to the intended readers/audiences about a topic to serve the purpose of knowledge sharing, entertainment, event reporting, etc. Rhetoric, introduced by the Greek philosopher Aristotle is the art of persuasion. Rhetoric has guided authors/speakers throughout centuries for effective communication using “Ethos”, “Logos” and “Pathos”. Ethos is the art of establishing authority on a subject/topic. Logos is building logical argumentation for the authors’/speakers’ viewpoint of the topic. Pathos is an attempt to persuade the readers’/audiences’ emotionally about the topic towards the intended viewpoint. It is the rhetoric that brings cognitive structure in natural language. Following the path of persuasive writing/speaking, professional authors/speakers use various structural forms to reach readers’/audiences’ cognitive minds. One such popular structural formula in this 20th century is Joseph Campbell’s ‘The Hero’s Journey’. It is a systematic approach that binds writers’/speakers’ creativity with readers’/audiences’ cognitivity.

      Cognitive neuroscience is the greatest inspiration for technological development surrounding machine learning and neural network developments for various tasks. Understanding the language processing of human brains can lead us to understand what more technologists should consider to investigate and implement to understand the creativity and cognitivity in language better for automated Natural Language Processing. Various cognitive neuroscience studies using fMRI, MRI etc. showed that both the left and right hemispheres of the brain contribute to the same task while the contribution of the left hemisphere is logical and contribution of the right hemisphere is creative. The theoretical language models presented by various neuroscientists do show that the conceptual understanding is happening in different positions of a brain than the actual linguistic processing. Till today, language processing technologists have learned words’ representation based on the linguistic, semantic and sentiment values. Technologists have also learned related concepts using knowledge graphs. But still, creativity in language representation and its corresponding cognitive value is yet to be discovered unanimously. Understanding cognitive representation is mandatory for winning long-distance dependency issues in contextual generative creative tasks, like summarization.

      Stories express writer’s rhetoric, trigger readers empathy, and preserve creativity. Formalizing automatic extraction of a story can be hugely important for evaluating the cognitive value of underlying extraction in a single document context as well as in a multi-document context. Inspired by “The Hero’s Journey”, Story Analysis extracts cognitively important nouns and verbs of the story and visually represents it using various representations. The visualization is vital for understanding the cognitive impact on the reader's psychology of the extraction. 
      This demo and experiment is designed to identify the cognitive importance of ‘Story Analysis’ based on news comprehension (reading &amp; writing) tasks.

      <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium">
        To build a collection of articles for this demo project, we have collected published articles 
        from the <a href="https://www.thepharmaletter.com/"">Pharmaletter News Publishers</a>. 
        For this demo, we have collected 730 articles published between 2021-03-01 and 2021-05-30. 
        Among these articles, 273 articles were published in March, 232 articles were published in 
        April and 225 articles were published in May. <a href="/demo">Demo</a> 
        provides a monthly (time-series)comprehensive data visualization on the whole collection 
        to guide on selecting a historical topic for throwback editorial reporting. On selecting a 
        topic a Terms Board visualization is produced for intuiting creative thoughts. 
        A list of documents scanned for producing the Terms Board is also presented. Selecting the 
        "Local Analysis" link of an article will visualize the story words extraction in a 
        clockwise radial bar chart.
