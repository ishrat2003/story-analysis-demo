<p>The Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute's Dr Kylie Wagstaff, who led the study, said the scientists showed that the drug, ivermectin, stopped the SARS-CoV-2 virus growing in cell culture within 48 hours.</p>

<p>""We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,"""" Dr Wagstaff said.</p>

<p>""Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective – that's the next step,"" Dr Wagstaff noted.</p>

<h2>Already FDA-approved as anti-parasitic</h2>
<p>Ivermectin is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, influenza and Zika virus. Ivermectin is the active ingredient of Merck & Co's Mectizan and Stromectil brands.</p>

<p>""In times when we're having a global pandemic and there isn't an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner. Realistically i'’s going to be a while before a vaccine is broadly available,"" Dr Wagstaff warned.</p>

<p>Although the mechanism by which ivermectin works on the virus is not known, it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus 'dampening down' the host cells' ability to clear it, Dr Wagstaff said.</p>

<p>The use of Ivermectin to combat COVID-19 would depend on the results of further pre-clinical testing and ultimately clinical trials, with funding urgently required to keep progressing the work, Dr Wagstaff said.</p>

<p>That is the view of Thomas Borody, a Sydney-based gastroenterologist famous for curing peptic ulcers using a triple antibiotic therapy. He has released the triple therapy protocol for COVID-19 to Australian general practitioners (GPs).</p>

<p>""Why are we just waiting around for a vaccine?"" He said: ""GPs can legally prescribe the therapy today as an off-label treatment according to Australian Guidelines - a standard practice in medicine. In fact, more than 60% of prescriptions in Australia are off-label. It's not a new concept. It's happening every day to manage diseases and save lives.""</p>

<p>""We have a therapy that can fight COVID-19. The medications have been around for 50 years, they are cheap, US Food and Drug Administration and Therapeutics Goods Administration approved and have an outstanding safety profile. Why are we just waiting around for a vaccine? To save lives, we should be using whatever is safe and available right now. We could lead the world in this fight.”</p>

<p>Professor Borody added: ""Australia has some of the best medical and science people in the world - indeed the ivermectin connection was first discovered by Kylie Wagstaff's team at Monash University in April"".</p>

<p>""How long do we need to wait before Australian politicians get behind Australian medical science and use 'war room' tactics with safe and approved medications.""</p>

<p>Professor Borody, who wants his country’s government to encourage GPs to prescribe the combination, has cited an almost 100% cure rate and symptom improvement within four to six days, based on international data.</p>

<p>Ivermectin was discovered in the 1970s and it is on the World Health Organization list of essential medicines. It is currently being researched in 28 COVID-19 studies globally.</p>

489015,"Challenges expected for Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine in USA","https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/challenges-expected-for-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-in-usa","23/06/21","<p>US vaccines developer Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) further demonstrated excellent results from its pivotal PREVENT-19 vaccine trial, with its COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373. Despite this positive data, it will likely see very little uptake in the USA, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company GlobalData.</p>

<p>""Novavax’s PREVENT-19 trial enrolled close to 30,000 participants across 119 sites in the US and Mexico. However, vaccination rates are decreasing in the US while mRNA vaccine supplies remain plentiful. It is likely that a large amount of the first doses will go to other countries that have a more urgent need for vaccines. The use of NVX-CoV2373 outside of the US can serve as a great alternative to adenovirus vector-based vaccines due to its easier storage requirements and higher efficacy levels,"" commented GlobalData pharma analyst Nancy Jaser.</p>

<p>Results show that NVX-CoV2373 was 93% effective against the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in the US and Mexico trial population including B.1.1.7 (Alpha). 54 out of the 77 subjects who contracted COVID-19 were sequenced in this trial, which is a high percentage relative to many other vaccine trials. Two cases were found to be caused by variant B.1.351 (Beta), 35 by Alpha, while the others are undisclosed.</p>

<h2>No data on Delta variant</h2>
<p>No sequenced case was determined to be associated with Delta. This limits the efficacy data against variants, as it only applies to strains circulating through the PREVENT-19 trial population. This is important to keep in mind, since the vaccine will be used globally upon approval.</p>

<p>Ms Jaser continued: ""Earlier this year, a Phase IIb trial in South Africa showed 48% efficacy against Beta while a Phase III trial in the UK indicated 86% efficacy for Alpha. Besides this, the vaccine is safe and has a 90% overall efficacy rate along with a 100% rate of protection against moderate and severe infections. Further, Novavax is testing other versions of this vaccine in an effort to increase efficacy against all variants of concern. Protection against all variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 is a key factor to control the pandemic globally and to finally see a decrease in new cases and deaths. While the US may not see much uptake, this vaccine is a much-needed weapon to end the pandemic battle on a global level.""</p>

<p>The company plans to file for regulatory approvals in the third quarter of this year and it expects to be able to manufacture 100 million doses per month by that time. Novavax currently has deals with the Serum Institute of India and GAVI, a COVAX partner, to supply it with hundreds of millions of doses. The US pre-ordered 100 million doses of Novavax’s vaccine through Operation Warp Speed; a large number of these doses will likely be distributed to ountries with a greater need for supply.</p>

<p>The antibody combination, formerly known as REGN-COV2, was developed in cooperation with US biotech Regeneron (Nasdaq: REGN), and was granted a Special Approval Pathway under article 14-3 of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act. This makes Japan the first country to formally authorize the drug.</p>

<h2>Licensed to Chugai for Japan</h2>
<p>In December 2020, Roche majority-owned Japanese drugmaker Chugai Pharmaceutical (TYO: 4519) obtained development and exclusive commercialization rights in Japan from Roche. Under the agreement with the Japanese government, the domestic supply of Ronapreve is secured for use in 2021. The company says it will continue to collaborate with the Japanese government to ensure an appropriate and timely supply of the antibody cocktail. </p>

<p>""Ronapreve has been shown to improve survival in high-risk, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients by reducing the risk of hospitalization and death. In addition, its ability to retain activity against emerging variants, including the Delta variant, has been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies,"" said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development. ""Today’s approval brings hope to patients in Japan who can now access this important treatment option,"" he noted.</p>

<p>The MHLW based the approval on results from the global Phase III REGN-COV 2067 study in high-risk non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which showed that casirivimab and imdevimab reduced hospitalization or death by 70% and symptom duration by four days, as well as a Phase I clinical study, examining the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in Japanese people.</p>

<h2>Cleared elsewhere for emergency use</h2>
<p>Outside Japan, the antibody combination has been authorized for emergency use or temporary pandemic use in additional territories and regions, including in the European Union, USA, India, Switzerland and Canada. Through the Operation Warp Speed program, the US government has secured up to 1.25 million additional doses of the casirivimab and imdevimab cocktail, in a deal valued at $2.625 billion.</p>

<p>It is also undergoing rolling review by the European Medicines Agency and was granted a scientific opinion (under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004) by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, supporting its use as a treatment option for patients with confirmed COVID-19 who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.</p>

<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a new phase with the emergence of multiple variants, and in order to bring the pandemic under control as soon as possible, it is extremely important to prevent new infections with vaccines and to expand the treatment options for people with COVID-19. Ronapreve reduced the risk of hospitalization or death, leading to suppression of aggravation and shortened time to the symptoms resolution for high-risk outpatients in a clinical study,"" said Dr Osamu Okuda, Chugai’s president and chief executive, adding: ""Also, Ronapreve is confirmed to be effective for the multiple variants including Delta variant in non-clinical studies.""</p>","Roche, Japan's Ministry","Japan, US","Ronapreve","Ronapreve reduced the risk of hospitalization or death, leading to suppression of aggravation and shortened time to the symptoms resolution for high-risk outpatients in a clinical study",
