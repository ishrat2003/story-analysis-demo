Women bring diverse perspectives that are needed more than ever.</em></p>\n<p>For decades, as women fought for a &ldquo;seat at the table&rdquo; in the world&rsquo;s centers of corporate power, they were still largely excluded from one of the most important tables of all: the one in the boardroom.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s been some remarkable progress in correcting this imbalance in just the last five years. In 2016, the UK government pledged to increase gender representation in boards of directors in the nation&rsquo;s top 350 companies.</p>\n<p>According to the Hampton-Alexander review that was released in February, women now hold one third of board positions&mdash;a number that rose to 1,026 from 682 directors.</p>\n<p>Yet the British life sciences industry still has a way to go. Although the report recognized GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) for their commitment to board diversity, a 2020 survey of 132 biotech, pharma and medtech companies by Liftstream, a UK life sciences executive search firm, tells a different story.</p>\n<p>Among 70 publicly-listed companies and 62 privately-held ones, women made up just 15% of board directors. Most shockingly, 41% of those companies have all-male boards.</p>\n<p>We must do better. During a time when board oversight matters more than ever to help companies navigate economic and industry upheaval, boards need a council of leaders with a mix of superpowers.</p>\n<p>That calls for including directors with varying skillsets, big-picture perspectives, knowledge bases and collaborative styles. That also means ensuring that women make up a significant percentage of life sciences boards, rather than just &ldquo;checking the box&rdquo; by bringing on a single &ldquo;token&rdquo; woman. In acknowledging the value that women bring to boardrooms, I prefer not to think of their contributions as simply &ldquo;female&rdquo; ones.</p>\n<p>Rather, they bring a diversity of thought that often facilitates more creative problem-solving.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that the Hampton-Alexander review found that such inclusion is good for business: companies that ranked in the top 25% for gender diversity on their executive teams were 25% more likely to be more profitable than those in the lowest quarter.</p>\n<p>Companies need to strive for such gender balance in both their boardrooms and executive ranks. This is especially the case in the British life sciences industry, where women account for only 21% of executive leadership roles.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming the last barriers</h2>\n<p>So how do we improve representation overall? We must continue to encourage more women to consider management positions. That&rsquo;s how they gain the breadth of experience that many companies value in board members. More recently, the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic, including working from home while taking care of children, have discouraged some women from gunning for positions that bring them more responsibility.</p>\n<p>As an industry, we must make sure this is a temporary setback; we simply can&rsquo;t afford to lose decades of progress in gender parity. We must double-double down on our efforts to support, hire and retain women leaders, whether through formal recruitment or informal mentorship.</p>\n<p>As for promoting board representation specifically, the good news is that there are several organizations leading the cause. Some non-profit, academic and industry groups offer &ldquo;board ready&rdquo; training programs that educate women about board opportunities in life sciences companies and help match them with board openings.</p>\n<p>Examples are Harvard University, which offers online courses designed to support Women on Boards (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/programs/women-on-boards), and Non Executive Directors on Boards in the UK, which provides training and support (https://www.nedonboard.com).</p>\n<p>Also, other global corporate actors are sending clear signals that women&rsquo;s inclusion on boards should simply be expected. For example, Goldman Sachs announced at the World Economic Forum last year that it will not take any company public that doesn&rsquo;t have gender diversity on its boards. So why are the life sciences still lagging so far behind?</p>\n<h2>Putting boards on women&rsquo;s radars</h2>\n<p>Women need to step up, too. I want to set the record straight about a particularly powerful myth that often discourages women from seeking out board opportunities. Many women I&rsquo;ve spoken with believe they&rsquo;re not qualified to serve on boards because companies are seeking only women with extensive corporate resumes and high visibility.</p>\n<p>First, that&rsquo;s just not true. Companies value candidates with many kinds of life and business experience.</p>\n<p>Second, there are many paths to get there: many people opt to serve for non-profit or charity boards before inquiring about positions at public and private companies. That&rsquo;s why I encourage women to be brave, raise their hands and be open to many kinds of service.</p>\n<p>I got a great start by serving on the board of a local mental health organization that helped veterans with PTSD find housing. In fact, that&rsquo;s where I learned a ton about fundraising best practices. I&rsquo;ve also been on boards for a hospital system and chamber of commerce before taking my current position on the board of a US pharmaceutical company.</p>\n<p>All of these opportunities gave me different perspectives and skills that helped me in my board and professional careers. And of course, serving on a board is personally rewarding.</p>\n<p>Board members add immeasurable value to companies and organizations trying to solve some of the world&rsquo;s most difficult problems. Our participation matters. Your voice matters.</p>\n<p>This is a unique time in history when more women are being invited to sit at bigger and more important tables. We must insist that all companies pull out their chairs&mdash;and encourage more women to take their rightful place.</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 18:14:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "women, boards, board, companies, life, sciences, representation, bring, corporate, directors, perspectives, industry, gender, executive, female, diversity", "meta_description": "Catherine Owen, senior vice president of major markets at Bristol Myers Squibb, provides an Expert View on why increasing female representation on corporate boa", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 17:49:12", "updated": "2021-05-08 14:13:52", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/the-continuing-quest-to-get-more-women-on-life-sciences-boards", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "catherine_owen_bms_large.jpg", "image2id": "catherine_owen_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Boardroom, Expert View, In Depth, Management", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 18:14:00"}
