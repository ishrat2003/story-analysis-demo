Thank you to the clinical trial participants, PNH community, investigators, healthcare professionals, SFJ Pharmaceuticals, and more who helped contribute to this significant milestone,&rdquo; said Dr Cedric Francois, co-founder and chief executive of Apellis. &ldquo;This approval represents a major scientific advancement as Empaveli ushers in the first new class of complement medicine in almost 15 years. We look forward to exploring the full potential of targeting C3 and continue to advance registrational programs of this therapy across multiple complement-driven diseases with high unmet need,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Drug out-licensed to Sobi</strong></h2>\n<p>Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (STO: SOBI; also known as Sobi) acquired global co-development and exclusive ex-US commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan last year, in a deal that provided an upfront $250 million for Apellis.</p>\n<p>PNH is characterized by red blood cell destruction, anemia (red blood cells unable to carry enough oxygen to tissues), blood clots, and impaired bone marrow function (not making enough blood cells). The disease affects 1-1.5 people per million. Individuals are typically diagnosed around ages 35 to 40. PNH can be serious, with median survival of 10 years after diagnosis. However, some patients live for decades with only minor symptoms.</p>\n<p>PNH is caused by gene mutations that affect red blood cells. Red blood cells in people with these mutations are defective and can be destroyed by the immune system, which causes anemia.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Empaveli was evaluated in a study enrolling 80 patients with PNH and anemia who had been taking eculizumab, a treatment previously approved for PNH. Patients first completed a four-week period during which they received Empaveli 1,080mg twice weekly in addition to eculizumab at their previous dose. After the first four weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive either Empaveli or their current dose of eculizumab for 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>A Marketing Authorization Application for pegcetacoplan&nbsp;for the treatment of PNH is under review by the European Medicines Agency with the potential for a European Commission decision in the second half of 2021.</p>", "date": "2021-05-18 10:14:00", "meta_title": "FDA approves Empaveli for life-threatening rare blood disease", "meta_keywords": "Apellis Pharmaceuticals,", "meta_description": "FDA approves Empaveli for life-threatening rare blood disease", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-18 09:01:43", "updated": "2021-05-18 10:14:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-empaveli-for-life-threatening-rare-blood-disease", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "apellis_big.png", "image2id": "apellis_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Apellis Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Empaveli, pegcetacoplan", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-18 10:14:00"}
