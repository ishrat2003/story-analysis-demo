The recommendations will also be adopted by the NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Specifically, acalabrutinib, a second generation BTK inhibitor, is recommended as a monotherapy option for adults with:<sup>1</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Untreated CLL who are considered high-risk due to certain genetic characteristics they harbor (17p deletion or TP53 mutation); or</li>\n<li>Untreated CLL who are considered non-high risk (no 17p deletion or TP53 mutation), and fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) is unsuitable; or</li>\n<li>Previously treated CLL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>First BTK inhibitor to be available for treatment at home</strong></h2>\n<p>This is the first time that untreated, non-high risk CLL patients who cannot be treated with standard chemotherapy will have access to targeted oral monotherapy with a BTK inhibitor that can be taken at home. Previously, standard treatment consisted of combination therapy involving intravenous administration in hospital. Other patients with CLL have had access to BTK inhibitor therapy since 2017.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Arun Krishna, Head of Oncology at AstraZeneca UK, said: &ldquo;Until recently, standard treatment for less fit, treatment na&iuml;ve, non-high risk CLL patients was chemo immunotherapy that is administered in hospital,&rdquo; commented Arun Krishna, head of oncology at AstraZeneca UK, adding: &ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic made even more acute the need for effective treatments that can be taken at home. In response, AstraZeneca enabled early access to acalabrutinib in April 2020 for patients within this at-need population. Today&rsquo;s welcome news from NICE means that this medicine will now become routinely available to CLL patients within the NHS, helping to improve the outcomes of patients living with this disease.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Acalabrutinib was licensed for use in Europe and the UK in November 2020 as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.</p>\n<p>Anna Schuh, associate professor and honorary consultant hematologist at Oxford University, noted: &ldquo;This NICE recommendation has the potential to improve disease outcomes for thousands of patients with CLL in the UK. There has been a significant unmet need for effective, targeted treatments that are well tolerated and that do not require multiple hospital visits, especially for patients in need of treatment for the first time. Acalabrutinib is generally well-tolerated and therefore represents a welcome new treatment option for older and frail patients. The NICE recommendation is therefore excellent news for the CLL community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 10:08:00", "meta_title": "NICE backing for AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Calquence in CLL", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Calquence, Leukemia, CLL, NICE, NHS use", "meta_description": "NICE backing for AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Calquence in CLL", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 09:53:38", "updated": "2021-03-18 10:08:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nice-backing-for-astrazeneca-s-calquence-in-cll", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca_big.jpg", "image2id": "astrazeneca_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, NICE", "drug_tag": "Calquence", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 10:08:00"}
