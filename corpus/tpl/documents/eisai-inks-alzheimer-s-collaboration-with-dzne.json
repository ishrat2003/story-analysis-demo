The collaboration will incorporate DZNE&rsquo;s expertise in the fundamental and clinical research with Eisai's abundant experience in drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases to accelerate development of novel drug candidates. No financial terms of the collaboration were disclosed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Eisai current Alzheimer&rsquo;s progress</strong></h2>\n<p>Eisai is one of the few drugmakers seeing apparent progress in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s. It has been developing aducanumab for the disease under a collaboration with US biotech Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB).</p>\n<p>Aducanumab has been under review with US Food and Drug Administration for some while, but, after a negative vote last November from the FDA&rsquo;s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee, the agency in January extended the review period by three months for their Biologics License Application (BLA), with an updated Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date now of June 7, 2021.</p>\n<p>Prof Pierluigi Nicotera, chairman of the DZNE&rsquo;s executive board, commented: &ldquo;We are pleased to have formed this collaboration with Eisai, which has an outstanding track record and a company-wide commitment to providing innovative treatments in the neurodegenerative disorders field. We think that this collaboration will be able to accelerate creation of new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, including those for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s. The DZNE will contribute knowledge and technical expertise in studying disease processes combined with our translational, patient-oriented approach that involves close interaction between fundamental and clinical research.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr Teiji Kimura, vice president, chief discovery officer of the Eisai Neurology Business Group, commented: &ldquo;Neurodegenerative diseases including AD comprise a disease area with high unmet medical needs. DZNE has many world-leading scientists in this field and we expect to create new disease-modifying therapies for those suffering from neurodegenerative disorders by conducting research for immune and metabolic incompetence in neurons and glia cells.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-17 14:00:00", "meta_title": "Eisai inks Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collaboration with DZNE", "meta_keywords": "Eisai, Collaboration, DZNE, Neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's", "meta_description": "Eisai inks Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collaboration with DZNE", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-17 13:58:27", "updated": "2021-03-17 14:08:44", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eisai-inks-alzheimer-s-collaboration-with-dzne", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eisaibig.jpg", "image2id": "eisaismall.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, Japan", "company_tag": "Eisai", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-17 14:00:00"}
