to regard the single trial, together with confirmatory evidence, as &ldquo;potentially meeting the standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness.\"</p>\n<h2>Change in fortunes</h2>\n<p>In early April, Provention stock fell significantly after the firm reported the US FDA had \"identified deficiencies\" in its ongoing review, which would &ldquo;preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments at this time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The agency stated that, based on the evidence it had seen, the pharmacokinetic profiles of two drug products featured in a bridging study were not comparable, and that more data would be required.</p>\n<p>The advisory panel is not tasked with answering this question on Thursday, but the FDA said it was working with Provention \"in a timely manner\" to resolve the matter.</p>\n<p>The latest briefing documents will raise hopes that the broader risk-benefit analysis is tipping in favor of approval, and that there is light at the end of the tunnel for the program.</p>\n<p>Given a lack of options for people with T1D, analysts have estimated that teplizumab could secure blockbuster status if approved, with expectations that a course of treatment could be priced at around $100,000.</p>\n<p>Chief executive Ashleigh Palmer said: \"We would like to recognize the FDA for their ongoing efforts in the review of the BLA for teplizumab and for convening this Advisory Committee meeting of key endocrinology leaders to discuss the potential merits of teplizumab as the first ever disease modifying therapy for T1D.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-26 14:59:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "teplizumab, Provention, type, diabetes, candidate, positive, briefing, firm, advisory, Mood, music, improves, rose, news, Jersey, related, Shares, Tuesday", "meta_description": "Shares in New Jersey, USA-based company Provention Bio rose by over a quarter on Tuesday, after the firm announced positive regulatory news related to its type ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-26 10:20:09", "updated": "2021-05-26 14:59:07", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mood-music-improves-for-type-1-diabetes-candidate", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "syringe_syringes_big.jpg", "image2id": "syringe_syringes_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Provention Bio", "drug_tag": "teplizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-26 14:59:00"}
