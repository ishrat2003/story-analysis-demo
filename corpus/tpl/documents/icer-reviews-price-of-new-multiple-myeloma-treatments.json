At our public meeting, our policy roundtable will likely discuss the potential for certain patients to require a second dose of these CAR-Ts, and what the implications will be not only for how T-cells should be initially harvested, but also on the treatments&rsquo; overall pricing, coverage, and long-term value.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Belantamab appears to deliver more modest clinical benefit, along with some safety concerns that have required the drug to be stopped or reduced in certain instances. At its current pricing, belantamab appears to meet commonly-cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness, but this favorable result is due in part to early discontinuation among many patients, as well as the high prices of the three-drug regimens to which belantamab was compared.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ICER&rsquo;s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range for ide-cel is between $192,000 and $265,000 per dose, which would require a 37% to 54% discount off the treatment&rsquo;s recently announced wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of $419,500.</p>\n<p>The HBPB assumes that there would be a second charge for individuals requiring retreatment. If a different pricing model were to be adopted, ICER&rsquo;s HBPB for ide-cel would change.</p>\n<p>The ICER&rsquo;s HBPB for cilta-cel is between $317,000 and $475,000, with the assumption that a second dose will require payment though this is considered preliminary as the evidence base is extremely limited and unpublished. Janssen, part of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Legend Biotech have not yet announced an estimated or actual price for the therapy.</p>\n<p>The HBPB for belantamab is between $8,300 and $9,500 per vial, which would require no discount off the therapy&rsquo;s WAC of $8,277 per vial.</p>\n<p>Belantamab is dosed based on a patient&rsquo;s weight, and GSK has projected that the treatment&rsquo;s monthly cost will average $23,900 per patient. However, the monthly cost may be above $32,000 for those requiring three vials.</p>\n<p>The cost-effectiveness results for belantamab are relatively favorable due in part to patients discontinuing therapy because of side effects, as well as the high prices for the three-drug alternatives, ICER says.</p>\n<p>The HBPB is the top price range at which a health system can reward innovation and better health for patients without doing more harm than good, the ICER explained.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-06 16:24:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "patients, clinical, treatments, belantamab, multiple, myeloma, ICER, therapy, TCRMM, effectiveness, evidence, price, HBPB, review, BCMA, ICERs, reviews", "meta_description": "The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has released an evidence report comparing clinical effectiveness and value of three new treatments targeti", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-06 16:19:27", "updated": "2021-04-07 08:55:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-reviews-price-of-new-multiple-myeloma-treatments", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "icer_big.jpg", "image2id": "icer_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Multiple myeloma", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "bluebird bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, Legend Biotech", "drug_tag": "Abecma, belantamab mafodotin, Blenrep, ciltacabtagene autoleucel, idecabtagene vicleucel", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-06 16:24:00"}
