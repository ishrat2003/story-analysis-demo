It is anticipated that BI 425809 will be launched in 2026 in the US, says data and analytics company GlobalData.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Christie Wong, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The current schizophrenia treatment landscape includes a high number of established atypical antipsychotic products that can effectively manage the positive symptoms of the disorder; however, there is a significant unmet need for novel effective treatment options for the negative symptoms and cognitive impairments seen in schizophrenia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As BI 425809 is the only pipeline drug in Phase III of development that has received BTD from the FDA, BI 425809 has the potential to become the first available pharmacological treatment for CIAS. However, BI 425809 will need to demonstrate in the CONNEX trial program a strong safety profile and efficacy in improving cognition in adults with schizophrenia. The program consists of three Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parrel group clinical trials where patients receive a daily dose of BI 425809 over a 26-week treatment period. The estimated primary completion dates for these trials are in May 2024.</p>\n<h2><strong>Likely to compete with Pfizer&rsquo;s PF-03463275</strong></h2>\n<p>Ms Wong added: &ldquo;Pfizer&rsquo;s PF-03463275 previously failed to demonstrate efficacy as an add-on therapy in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia when added to ongoing antipsychotic treatment. However, PF-03463275 is likely to compete directly with BI 425809 for CIAS indication due to its similar mechanism of action, targeting the sodium and chloride dependent glycine transporter 1 (Glyt1). Furthermore, both candidates are orally administered.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;PF-03463275 is currently in Phase II of development, with an estimated primary completion date in December 2021. As such, BI 425809 is anticipated to have the first-to-market advantage over PF-03463275.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-28 11:44:00", "meta_title": "Boehringer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BI 425809 has potential in schizophrenia market, says ana", "meta_keywords": "Boehringer Ingelheim, BI 425809, Schizophrenia, Market, Potential, GlobalData, Pfizer, PF-03463275", "meta_description": "Boehringer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BI 425809 has potential in schizophrenia market, says analyst", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-28 11:43:31", "updated": "2021-05-28 11:52:00", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/boehringer-s-bi-425809-has-potential-in-schizophrenia-market-says-analyst", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "boehringer_building_large.jpg", "image2id": "boehringer_building_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Schizophrenia", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Markets & Marketing, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany", "company_tag": "Boehringer Ingelheim, GlobalData, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "BI 425809, PF-03463275", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-28 11:44:00"}
