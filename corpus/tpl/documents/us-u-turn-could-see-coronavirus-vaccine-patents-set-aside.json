India is currently reporting close to 400,000 new cases per day.</p>\n<p>Anna Marriott, health policy manager at Oxfam, said that the current approach to vaccination had &ldquo;so far denied access to these life-saving tools for billions of people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She added: &ldquo;As thousands of people die daily in India, the continued failure of the G7 to break with the pharma-controlled monopolies is inexcusable.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Industry reaction</h2>\n<p>Vaccine developers have been ramping up production, promising significant increases in supply in the coming months.</p>\n<p>This includes Moderna, which recently announced plans to manufacture up to three billion doses of its mRNA-based product in 2022.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the lack of availability in the short and medium term has prompted countries to support the IP waiver, proposed by India and South Africa, which would pave the way for unbranded versions of leading vaccines to be developed.</p>\n<p>The pharmaceutical industry has criticized the move, however, questioning whether checks on quality and safety could guarantee the products.</p>\n<p>The industry is also concerned that the waiver would remove incentives for companies to continue researching new variants, diagnostics and treatments, while making it less likely that the private sector would react quickly in the event of another pandemic.</p>\n<p>Nathalie Moll, director general of European pharma trade group EFPIA called the decision &ldquo;short-sighted&rdquo; and &ldquo;ineffectual,&rdquo; adding it would put &ldquo;the hard-won progress in fighting this terrible disease in jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She said: &ldquo;While we wholeheartedly agree with the goal of protecting citizens around the world through vaccines, waiving patents will make winning the fight against the coronavirus even harder.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-06 12:39:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "coronavirus, vaccines, countries, trade, vaccine, intellectual, property, waiver, world, U-turn, COVID-, backed, patents, surprise, Government, proposal", "meta_description": "To the surprise of many, the US Government has backed a World Trade Organization (WTO) proposal to disclaim certain intellectual property (IP) rights to coronav", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-06 12:12:58", "updated": "2021-05-06 12:41:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-u-turn-could-see-coronavirus-vaccine-patents-set-aside", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biden_big-1.jpg", "image2id": "biden_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Biden administration, Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Legal, Patents & Trademarks", "geography_tag": "Global, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, mRNA-1273, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-06 12:39:00"}
