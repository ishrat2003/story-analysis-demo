The data were presented in a Clinical Trials Plenary Session on April 10 at the virtual American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting 2021, and simultaneously published in The Lancet Oncology.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bayer is committed to putting patients&rsquo; needs first and delivering innovative treatment options that address areas of high unmet need, and clinical research is the first step in that process,&rdquo; said Dr Scott Fields, senior vice president and head of oncology development at Bayer. \"These data highlight the potential of Aliqopa and rituximab as a new strategy for treating these patients and we look forward to advancing regulatory discussions,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>First PI3K inhibitor to demonstrate superior efficacy</strong></h2>\n<p>These results make Aliqopa the first PI3K inhibitor to demonstrate superior efficacy in combination with rituximab with a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed iNHL, Dr Fields noted. This could be viewed as a redemption of the drug class, once touted as having blockbuster potential, but that has not yet been realized.</p>\n<p>Bayer said it is in discussions with health authorities worldwide regarding the data from CHRONOS-3.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Aliqopa was approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies based on the results of a single-arm, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial (CHRONOS-1). Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.</p>\n<p>Aliqopa also has US Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In clinical practice, we have seen an overall improvement in the prognosis of iNHL patients, yet relapsed disease is still a prominent treatment challenge,&rdquo; said Dr Matthew Matasar, Medical Oncologist, Regional Care Network Medical Site Director, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Bergen. &ldquo;The results reported with the combination of copanlisib and rituximab suggest a potential advancement for patients with these diverse types of cancers,&rdquo; he opined.</p>", "date": "2021-04-12 10:14:00", "meta_title": "Aliqopa combo shows significant PFS in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma", "meta_keywords": "Bayer, Aliqopa, Rituximab, Combination, PFSi, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, AACR", "meta_description": "Aliqopa combo shows significant PFS in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-11 16:48:39", "updated": "2021-04-12 10:14:49", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/aliqopa-combo-shows-significant-pfs-in-non-hodgkin-s-lymphoma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "aacr-big-1.jpg", "image2id": "aacr-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Lymphoma", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "AACR, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany", "company_tag": "Bayer", "drug_tag": "Aliqopa, rituximab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-12 10:14:00"}
