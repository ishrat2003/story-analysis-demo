The transaction has been approved by the shareholders and the board of directors of Rodeo.</p>\n<p>Rodeo is focused on developing first-in-class, orally available modulators of prostaglandin biology that play an important role in tissue regeneration and repair. Rodeo's lead 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) modulators have generated compelling data in extensive preclinical studies and have clinical potential in multiple indications.</p>\n<p>\"The enzyme 15-PGDH plays a key role in many disease-relevant processes such as stem cell self-renewal and epithelial barrier repair. Given the encouraging pre-clinical data to date, we are excited about the opportunity to develop a novel therapy with potential in a range of important inflammatory disease indications,\" said Raymond Deshaies, senior vice president of Global Research at Amgen.</p>\n<p>Thong Q Le, president and chief executive of Rodeo, commented: \"We are thrilled that Amgen recognizes the potential value and differentiated profile of our 15-PGDH inhibitor program. With decades of experience in developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative therapies for patients suffering from a broad range of immunologic diseases and conditions, Amgen is ideally positioned to rapidly advance our program into the clinic.\"</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 12:08:00", "meta_title": "Amgen bags 15-PGDH as it rides in with a bid for Rodeo Therapeutics", "meta_keywords": "Amgen, Rodeo Therapeutics, Acquisition, M&A,15-PGDH program", "meta_description": "Amgen bags 15-PGDH as it rides in with a bid for Rodeo Therapeutics", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 12:07:29", "updated": "2021-03-31 12:15:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-bags-15-pgdh-as-it-rides-in-with-a-bid-for-rodeo-therapeutics", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "amgen_large.jpg", "image2id": "amgen_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immunologicals, Inflammatory diseases, Regenerative Medicine", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Amgen, Rodeo Therapeutics", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 12:08:00"}
