{"contentid": 488700, "importid": NaN, "name": "Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf-life extended to 31 days", "introduction": "New storage conditions for the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BioNTech  have today been approved by the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).", "content": "<p>New storage conditions for the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Germany&rsquo;s BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX) have today been approved by the UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>\n<p>The new storage conditions extend the length of time the thawed vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures from five days to 31 days,</p>\n<p>The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, now dubbed Comirnaty in Europe, which was the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by the UK regulator in December last year, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures until use. The changes, that extend the shelf-life once thawed, are therefore expected to make storage easier and possible for a wider range of health facilities.</p>\n<p>The change was approved following the MHRA&rsquo;s detailed review of additional stability data submitted to the regulator by Pfizer.</p>\n<p>Dr June Raine, the MHRA chief executive, said: &ldquo;We are pleased to confirm that, having rigorously assessed the additional data submitted to us by the company, we have now approved more flexible storage conditions for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Up until now, the Pfizer vaccine had to be administered within five days of being removed from ultra-low temperature freezers. Now that the jab can be stored at normal fridge temperatures for up to 31 days, it can be used in a wider range of healthcare settings, giving patients greater access to the Pfizer vaccine.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Similar decision from EMA</strong></h2>\n<p>The MHRA announcement follows one on Monday from the European Medicines Agency, which likewise approved more flexible storage conditions for Comirnaty &ndash; extending the storage period of unopened thawed vials in a +2-8C fridge from five days to 31.</p>\n<p>The change was approved following assessment of additional stability study data submitted to EMA by the marketing authorization holder, ie, BioNTech. Increased flexibility in the storage and handling of the vaccine is expected to have a significant impact on planning and logistics of vaccine roll-out in EU member states, the EMA noted.</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 14:55:00", "meta_title": "Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf-life extended to 31 days", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, BioNTech, COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, Comirnaty, Storage, Self-life, EMA, MHRA", "meta_description": "Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf-life extended to 31 days", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 14:53:49", "updated": "2021-05-21 15:05:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-shelf-life-extended-to-31-days", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biontech_vaccine_large.jpg", "image2id": "biontech_vaccine_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, Germany, UK, USA", "company_tag": "BioNTech, Pfizer, The European Medicines Agency", "drug_tag": "BNT162b2, Comirnaty", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 14:55:00"}
