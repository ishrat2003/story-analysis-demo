Additional financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Brian Sullivan, chief executive of Celcuity, said: &ldquo;We are excited about the opportunity to utilize our CELsignia platform to support the development of a potential first-in-class targeted therapy like gedatolisib.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In light of the important role the PI3K/mTOR pathway plays in driving tumor growth when patients become resistant to endocrine therapies, we believe gedatolisib is a highly promising drug candidate to improve outcomes for patients with breast cancer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Supporting development of a potential first-in-class therapy for breast cancer, such as gedatolisib, with our CELsignia platform is a natural extension of our strategy to develop CELsignia CDx for other breast cancer therapies. We believe developing targeted therapies that benefit from the CELsignia platform while also offering companion diagnostics that enable new drug indications, creates a synergistic advantage for each program.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Trial results send stock value skywards</h2>\n<p>Gedatolisib is currently being evaluated in combination with palbociclib, an oral CDK 4/6 inhibitor, and either letrozole or fulvestrant in the expansion portion of a Phase Ib clinical trial in patients with ER+/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Results from the trial were announced late on Thursday, and Celcuity's shares were up by more than 40% at the mid-point of Friday's trading.</p>\n<p>A total of 103 patients were enrolled in one of four different arms according to their prior treatment history for metastatic breast cancer. A preliminary analysis of the objective response rates as of the January 11, 2021 data cut-off demonstrated that gedatolisib combined with palbociclib and an endocrine therapy achieved superior objective response rates relative to historical control data. Gedatolisib was also generally well-tolerated.</p>\n<p>Art DeCillis, Celcuity&rsquo;s chief medical officer, said: &ldquo;In light of the data reported as of the January 11, 2021 data cut-off, we intend to initiate, subject to feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration, a Phase II/III clinical trial evaluating gedatolisib in combination with palbociclib and an endocrine therapy in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the first half of 2022.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-09 17:58:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "gedatolisib, Celcuity, breast, cancer, exclusive, rights, patients, Phase, development, agreement, Pfizer, CELsignia, inhibitor, metastatic, therapy, trial", "meta_description": "US biotech Celcuity has entered into a global licensing agreement with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) to acquire exclusive rights to the US pharma giant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gedatolisib, a Pha", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-09 17:46:31", "updated": "2021-04-09 18:31:41", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/celcuity-granted-exclusive-rights-to-pfizer-s-gedatolisib", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "celcuity_large-1-.png", "image2id": "celcuity_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Celcuity, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Gedatolisib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-09 17:58:00"}
