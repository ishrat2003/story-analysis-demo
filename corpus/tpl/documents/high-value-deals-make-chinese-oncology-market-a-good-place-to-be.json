Tislelizumab was already approved in China for classical Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma and locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.</p>\n<p>Ms Sahu added: &ldquo;Both the deals are related to either late-stage development molecules or already established molecules in China. This is a win-win situation as it gives opportunity for novel therapies developed in China to gain global access while the licensee companies can leverage drug development cost and time benefits associated with shorter time-to-market molecules.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>GlobalData reveals that 41 high-value deals have been completed in APAC since 2011, of which over 24 are related to oncology, with 10 involving Chinese companies.</p>\n<p><img title=\"unnamed-5.jpg\" src=\"/media/project_tpl/image/unnamed-5.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed-5.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"424\" /></p>\n<p>Ms Sahu said: &ldquo;Despite the COVID-19 situation, deals valued at more than $1 billion in China witnessed 100% year-on-year increase to four in 2020 versus two in 2019.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center, China has 3,667 ongoing clinical trials for 1,761 oncological drugs as of 10 March 2021.</p>\n<p>Ms Sahu said: &ldquo;As the clinical drug development ecosystem in China evolves towards innovative therapies, clinical trials in the field of oncology are increasing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition, with the prevailing high cancer incidence in China, oncology will remain an undisputed therapy area choice for deal-making.</p>\n<p>Ms Sahu concluded: &ldquo;With immuno-oncology expected to continue as one of the most impactful trends in the biopharmaceutical industry in 2021, it is expected that more and more companies are likely to tap this opportunity to form strategic collaborations with their Chinese counterparts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://depositphotos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">DepositPhotos</a></p>", "date": "2021-03-12 12:45:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "deals, China, oncology, high-value, Chinese, Sahu, GlobalData, APAC, pharma, strategic, market, good, place, clinical, research, lucrative, space, dominate", "meta_description": "The Asia-Pacific (APAC) pharmaceutical strategic partnership landscape in 2020 was dominated by high-value deals, with Chinese oncology a particularly lucrative", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-12 12:10:01", "updated": "2021-03-12 12:46:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/high-value-deals-make-chinese-oncology-market-a-good-place-to-be", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "china_credit_depositphotos_large-1.jpg", "image2id": "china_credit_depositphotos_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Asia Pacific, China", "company_tag": "BeiGene, CStone Pharmaceuticals, EQRx, Novartis", "drug_tag": "CS1003, sugemalimab, tislelizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-12 12:45:00"}
