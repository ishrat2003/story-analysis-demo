Ocrevus is the number one prescribed MS medication in the USA for patients starting a new treatment, and more than 200,000 people have now been treated with Ocrevus globally, the Swiss pharma giant says.</p>\n<p>As Roche&rsquo; best-selling drug, Ocrevus revenues were 24% higher at 4.3 billion francs ($4.65 billion) for full-year 2020. By 2028, annual sales of the drug are predicted to reach $7.6 billion, according to the data and analytics company GlobalData.</p>\n<p>However, Ocrevus is expected to face tough competition in the near future. The strongest direct to watch for is Swiss rival Novartis&rsquo; (NOVN: VX) Kesimpta (ofatumumab), which was Food and Drug Administration-approved in August 2020 for patients with different forms of RMS.</p>\n<h2><strong>More people with MS are staying on Ocrevus</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;All patients regardless of their form of MS experience disease progression from the start. Therefore, we are encouraged by these new analyses showing that early treatment with Ocrevus may significantly control disease progression in both relapsing-remitting MS and in primary progressive MS. Controlling progression can enable people with MS to maintain mobility and limit their disability,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer and head of global product development. &ldquo;In addition, our data show that more people with MS are staying on Ocrevus, the only twice-yearly treatment for MS, compared with other therapies, which may translate to improved outcomes.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> <strong>Two-year US claims analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately 80% of patients adhered to twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing of Ocrevus after their second year of treatment compared with other DMTs, which were grouped by administration route (35% adherence to injectables, 55% to orals and 54% to other infusions), in a new analysis of US commercial and insurance claims databases. Ocrevus also had the highest proportion of patients (75%) persist with therapy at two years (33% with injectables, 54% with orals and 55% with other infusions).</p>", "date": "2021-04-16 12:26:00", "meta_title": "Strong new data for Roche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ocrevus in MS", "meta_keywords": "Roche, Ocrevus, Multiple sclerosis, PPMS, RRMS, AAN meeting, Novartis, Kesimpta", "meta_description": "Strong new data for Roche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ocrevus in MS", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-16 11:49:17", "updated": "2021-04-16 12:26:23", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strong-new-data-for-roche-s-ocrevus-in-ms", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ocrevus_large.png", "image2id": "ocrevus_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "MS", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "AAN, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Novartis, Roche", "drug_tag": "Kesimpta, Ocrevus", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-16 12:26:00"}
