The primary efficacy endpoint was the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), with secondary endpoints of stool weight, signs and symptoms of malabsorption and coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA).</p>\n<p>The trial also included an extension arm that used an immediate release MS1819 capsule, allowing the company to compare data from the existing arm that uses enteric (delayed release) capsules with data from the new arm, and ultimately select the optimal delivery method.</p>\n<h2><strong>&lsquo;OPTION 2 top-line results mixed&rsquo;</strong></h2>\n<p>Discussing the results during the conference call, James Sapirstein, president, chief executive and chairman of AzurRx, commented: &ldquo;To summarize, the best word to describe the OPTION 2 top-line results is mixed. MS1819 demonstrated itself to be safe and well-tolerated and data from OPTION 2, and other Phase II clinical trials, clearly demonstrate drug activity. However, OPTION 2 did not consistently meet the primary efficacy endpoint. Some patients were able to achieve CFA at levels beyond what is required to demonstrate non-inferiority with PERT therapies, but the majority did not, and as such, we did not meet our trial goal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr Sapirstein continued: &ldquo;The underlying cause of the drug&rsquo;s uneven efficacy performance in OPTION 2, we believe, lies with the enteric capsule formulation. While the enteric coating protects the capsule from breaking down in the stomach acid, it also appears to dissolve too slowly in the small intestine to release the lipase enzyme in time to aid with proper digestion and nutrient absorption.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We firmly believe the cost-benefit ratio with MS1819 is clearly in our favor. The drug&rsquo;s mechanism of action is known and proven, it offers numerous therapeutic, safety and compliance advantages over today&rsquo;s standard of care, and remains less cumbersome to manufacture. Based on these factors, we believe that should this optimized formulation prove successful in the clinic &ndash; and we have every reason to believe it will &ndash; MS1819 could eventually become the gold standard treatment for EPI in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;cystic_fibrosis_credit_depositphotos</p>", "date": "2021-04-03 15:56:00", "meta_title": "AzurRx BioPharma slumps as OPTION 2 trial of MS1819 in CF fails", "meta_keywords": "AzurRx BioPharma, OPTION 2, MS1819, Cystic fibrosis, Phase IIb", "meta_description": "AzurRx BioPharma slumps as OPTION 2 trial of MS1819 in CF fails", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-03 15:55:51", "updated": "2021-04-03 16:05:00", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/azurrx-biopharma-slumps-as-option-2-trial-of-ms1819-in-cf-fails", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cystic_fibrosis_credit_depositphotos.jpg", "image2id": "cystic_fibrosis_credit_depositphotos_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Cystic fibrosis", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AzurRx BioPharma", "drug_tag": "MS1819", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-03 15:56:00"}
