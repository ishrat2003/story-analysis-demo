Despite advancements in treatment, most patients relapse after initial therapies, and with each successive treatment, the depth and duration of response as well as survival outcomes decrease. Patients who have been exposed to three classes of treatment (triple-class exposed) have even poorer survival outcomes. As the first and only approved anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy, Abecma addresses a critical unmet need and offers patients a new, personalized therapeutic option, the companies noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Provides a new treatment option</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr Peter Marks, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, commented: &ldquo;While there is no cure for multiple myeloma, the long-term outlook can vary based on the individual&rsquo;s age and the stage of the condition at the time of diagnosis. Today&rsquo;s approval provides a new treatment option for patients who have this uncommon type of cancer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;CAR-T cell therapies have shown transformational potential for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, and we, with our partners at bluebird bio, are proud to bring the first CAR-T cell therapy to appropriate triple-class exposed patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, offering the chance for durable response,&rdquo; said Dr Samit Hirawat, chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb, adding: &ldquo;As our second FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, Abecma underscores our commitment to deliver on the promise of cell therapies for patients who are battling aggressive and advanced blood cancers with limited effective treatment options.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our journey to today&rsquo;s approval of Abecma started nearly a decade ago with pioneering research at bluebird bio and has been driven ever since by our mission to provide patients with multiple myeloma a new approach to fight this relentless disease,&rdquo; said Nick Leschly, chief bluebird, bluebird bio. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement represents an important milestone for bluebird bio, marking both our first approved treatment in oncology and our first approved treatment in the United States,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>A network has been created to support rapid and dependable manufacturing of Abecma and ensure capacity to accommodate patient demand. Abecma&nbsp;will be manufactured for each individual patient using the patient&rsquo;s own T cells at Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s state-of-the-art cellular immunotherapy manufacturing facility in Summit, New Jersey.
