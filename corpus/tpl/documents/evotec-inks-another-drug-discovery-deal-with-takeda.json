The collaboration will leverage Evotec's extensive RNA targeting platform to optimally identify promising RNA sequences to target with small molecule ligands that can be developed into potentially first-in-class therapeutics.</p>\n<h2><strong>Terms of the accord</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Evotec will receive significant research funding and will be eligible to receive discovery, pre-clinical, clinical, commercial and sales milestone payments of up to $160 m per program. Additionally, Evotec is entitled to tiered royalties on net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration.</p>\n<p>\"Many highly validated targets have proven to be intractable via conventional protein targeting approaches. For this reason, Evotec has been pioneering RNA targeting strategies and approaches for quite some time. We are very excited about the opportunity to collaborate with Takeda in this field as both companies share the vision to jointly develop small molecule therapeutics against high value RNA targets that will deliver long awaited therapeutics,\" commented Evotec&rsquo;s chief scientific officer.</p>\n<p>Takeda&rsquo;s head of drug discovery sciences Dr Larry Hamann added: \"Takeda recognizes targeting RNA with small molecules as a promising new modality that has tremendous potential for much needed medicines for patients through modulating historically undruggable targets.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-22 11:06:00", "meta_title": "Evotec inks another drug discovery deal with Takeda", "meta_keywords": "Evotec, Takeda, Alliance, Discovery, RNA, Undruggable targets", "meta_description": "Evotec inks another drug discovery deal with Takeda", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-22 11:05:20", "updated": "2021-03-22 11:11:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/evotec-inks-another-drug-discovery-deal-with-takeda", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "evotec-large.png", "image2id": "evotec-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, Japan", "company_tag": "Evotec, Takeda", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-22 11:06:00"}
