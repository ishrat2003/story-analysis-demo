The bulk of them (1.7 billion roubles) accounted for sales of generics of Lantus (insulin glargine) originated by Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) and Humalog (insulin lispro injection 100 units/mL) from Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, France&rsquo;s Sanofi and the USA&rsquo;s Lilly have reduced their supplies by 4%, to 9.1 billion roubles and by 2.2 times to 586 million roubles, respectively. The only foreign supplier of insulin that was able to increase shipments was Danish Novo Nordisk, whose sales increased by 3% to 8.8 billion roubles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, Geropharm increased its share in government purchases of the drug to 10.6%, compared to 4.6% a year earlier. The rest was mainly accounted for by foreign companies. In addition, two more Russian players, Endogenics and Profitmed, expanded into insulin glargine market, selling analogs worth up to 376.5 million roubles in 2020.</p>\n<p>According to Sergey Shulyak, general director of DSM Group, Russian suppliers, as a rule, offer a lower price during state purchases, which allows them to therefore increase their share.</p>\n<p>Representatives of Eli Lilly Russia also linked the drop in Humalog sales in the Russian market with the launch of its local generics.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Insulin import substitution project</strong></h2>\n<p>The insulin import substitution project is being implemented in Russia as part of the federal targeted program \"Pharma-2020.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of the program, Geropharm in 2017 signed a special investment contract with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the government of St Petersburg for the construction of a plant for the production of insulin. In 2019, the company began the launch of its own versions of the two most expensive analogues of insulins, and last year it started the production of an analogue of aspart, which was previously supplied only by Denmark&rsquo;s Novo Nordisk (NOV: N).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Russian analysts, while the launch of new generics is restrained by the current patents of foreign companies, Geropharm is close to beginning of production of other insulin analogues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An official spokesman of Geropharm confirmed in an interview with Kommersant that the company plans to expand its portfolio with five more new insulins: insulin aspart two-phase, insulin degludec and insulin glargine in a dosage of 300 units are at different stages from development to registration.</p>\n<p>According to analysts, if a new package of preferences for Russian companies in public procurements is adopted, the same Geropharm will be able to supply its drugs for state needs and to withdraw those imported drugs, which are produced from foreign raw materials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spokesman of Sanofi also said that the entire line of the company's insulins is produced at a plant in the Oryol region and the products thus have the status of local drugs. The company added that its innovative insulin Toujeo SoloStar was registered in Russia in 2016 and has patent protection until 2031.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-11 10:32:00", "meta_title": "Global insulin producers losing positions 0in Russian marke", "meta_keywords": "Insulin, Producers, Russian, Market share, Geropharm Sanofi, Lantus, Eli Lilly, Humalog", "meta_description": "Global insulin producers losing positions 0in Russian marke", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-11 10:29:17", "updated": "2021-05-11 10:40:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/global-insulin-producers-losing-positions-0in-russian-market", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "diabetes_general_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "diabetes_general_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, Geropharm, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "Humalog, Insulin, Lantus", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-11 10:32:00"}
