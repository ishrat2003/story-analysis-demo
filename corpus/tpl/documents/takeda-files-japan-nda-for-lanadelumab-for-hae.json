HAE affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. In Japan, it is estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 people are living with HAE, but only about 450 have been diagnosed due to low awareness of the disorder in the country.</p>\n<p>Takhzyro received its first approval for the prevention of HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in 2018 and the drug is now available in more than 20 countries with additional regulatory submissions ongoing worldwide.</p>\n<p>For the first nine months of Takeda&rsquo;s current fiscal year, the drug &ndash; which came into Takeda&rsquo;s hands with the $62 billion acquisition of Shire - generated sales of 65.9 billion yen ($610 million), up 38% on the like year-earlier period.</p>\n<h2><strong>Blockbuster sales projections</strong></h2>\n<p>Analytics firm Evaluate has forecast that Takhzyro will generate annual sales of $1.74 billion by 2024, while others suggest a peak sales figure of $2 billion.
