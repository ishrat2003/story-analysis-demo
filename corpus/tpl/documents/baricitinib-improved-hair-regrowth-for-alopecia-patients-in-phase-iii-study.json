The data are consistent with findings from the first Phase III clinical trial, BRAVE-AA2, top-lined earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the companies announced disappointed results of COV-BARRIER, a Phase III study evaluating baricitinib 4mg once daily plus standard of care (SoC) versus placebo plus SoC for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Approved under the trade name Olumiant, baricitinib is primarily a rheumatoid arthritis therapy.</p>\n<p>In both investigational alopecia trials, a statistically-significant proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieved the primary endpoint of hair regrowth across the two dosing regimens at Week 36 compared to patients treated with placebo. AA is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that can progress, and currently has no therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Pressing need for approved treatment options&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\"There is a pressing need for approved treatment options for people suffering from alopecia areata as existing topicals and steroids do not provide meaningful improvement for many patients,\" said Dr Maryanne Senna, dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School and clinical trial investigator of BRAVE-AA1. \"I am pleased to see such positive results from these important trials of baricitinib offering a much-needed potential breakthrough treatment option for this disease.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The BRAVE-AA trial program was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in adult patients with severe AA. The program consists of two trials: BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2. BRAVE-AA1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive Phase II/III trial. Based on interim results of the Phase 2 portion of BRAVE-AA1 at Week 12, baricitinib 2mg and 4mg once-daily doses were selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 portion of the study.</p>", "date": "2021-04-20 16:21:00", "meta_title": "Baricitinib improved hair regrowth for alopecia patients in Phase III", "meta_keywords": "Incyte, Eli Lilly, Baricitinib, Phase III, BRAVE-AA1, Alopecia areata", "meta_description": "Baricitinib improved hair regrowth for alopecia patients in Phase III study", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-20 16:20:59", "updated": "2021-04-20 16:28:01", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/baricitinib-improved-hair-regrowth-for-alopecia-patients-in-phase-iii-study", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "lilly-incyte-big.png", "image2id": "lilly-incyte-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Hair diseases", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders, Dermatologicals", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, Incyte", "drug_tag": "baricitinib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-20 16:21:00"}
