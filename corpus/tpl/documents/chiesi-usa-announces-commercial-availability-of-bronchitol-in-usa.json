In the multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study of 423 adults with CF, subjects received either mannitol 400mg or mannitol 50mg (control), twice-daily via dry powder inhaler for 26 weeks. Authors concluded that mannitol 400mg inhaled twice-daily via a dry powder inhaler statistically significantly improved lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) compared with control, with this improvement supported by sensitivity analyses. Most common adverse reactions (&ge;3%) include cough, hemoptysis, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, bacteria sputum identified, pyrexia and arthralgia.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Chiesi USA has a longstanding commitment to advancing treatments and patient care programs among the CF community, and we are thrilled to add Bronchitol to our comprehensive offering,&rdquo; said Jon Zwinski, general manager and chief executive of Chiesi USA. &ldquo;We are excited to bring the first dry powder inhaled mucoactive agent to the US for adults with CF, delivered by a portable device that doesn&rsquo;t require routine maintenance or cleaning,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Licensed from Pharmaxis</strong></h2>\n<p>Bronchitol was developed by Australia&rsquo;s Pharmaxis (ASX: PXS), and Chiesi is now its exclusive distributor in the USA and 11 countries in Europe. Bronchitol is also approved and marketed in Australia, Europe, Russia, and several other countries.</p>\n<p>The precise mechanism of action of Bronchitol in improving pulmonary function in CF patients is unknown. Data suggest that the drug may impact sputum properties, however, a causal relationship between changes in sputum properties and pulmonary function have not been demonstrated.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-17 16:51:00", "meta_title": "Chiesi USA announces commercial availability of Bronchitol in USA", "meta_keywords": "Chiesi, Pharmaxis, Bronchitol, Availability, Cystic fibrosis, Pulmonary function", "meta_description": "Chiesi USA announces commercial availability of Bronchitol in USA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-17 16:49:54", "updated": "2021-03-17 16:59:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chiesi-usa-announces-commercial-availability-of-bronchitol-in-usa", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "chiesi-big.png", "image2id": "chiesi-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Pulmonary function", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Deals, Product Launch", "geography_tag": "Australia, Italy, USA", "company_tag": "Chiesi Farmaceutici, Pharmaxis", "drug_tag": "Bronchitol", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-17 16:51:00"}
