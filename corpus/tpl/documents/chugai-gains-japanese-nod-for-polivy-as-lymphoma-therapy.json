In the USA, Polivy was approved in June 2019 in combination with bendamustine and another Roche drug, MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The Japanese approval is based on data including the results from a multicenter overseas Phase Ib/II clinical study (GO29365) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Polivy in combination with BR therapy compared to BR therapy alone, and a multicenter, single-arm Japanese phase II study (JO40762/P-DRIVE study) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in R/R DLBCL.</p>\n<p>The efficacy and safety of Polivy and BR therapy (40 patients) compared with BR therapy alone (40 patients) was studied in the randomized phase II part of the GO29365 study in 80 patients with R/R DLBCL not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The primary endpoint of the complete response rate (CRR) at the time point of primary response assessment (PRA; six to eight weeks after last dose of Polivy) as evaluated by an independent assessment committee using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was 40% (16/40 patients; 95% CI: 24.9-56.7%) in the Polivy + BR therapy group, and 17.5% (7/40 patients; 95% CI: 7.3-32.8%) in the BR therapy group (data cut-off: April 30, 2018).</p>\n<p>Adverse reactions occurred in 36 (92.3%) patients out of 39 patients who received Polivy. The most common adverse reactions were neutropenia 53.8% (21/39 patients), thrombocytopenia 41.0% (16/39 patients), diarrhea and anemia 33.3% (13/39 patients) each, fatigue and nausea 23.1% (9/39 patients) each, and pyrexia and peripheral neuropathy 20.5% (8/39 patients) each.</p>", "date": "2021-03-23 16:57:00", "meta_title": "Chugai gains Japanese nod for Polivy as lymphoma therapy", "meta_keywords": "Chugai Pharma, Polivy, Approval, MHLW, Lymphoma, B-cell, DLBCL, Roche", "meta_description": "Chugai gains Japanese nod for Polivy as lymphoma therapy", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-23 16:56:59", "updated": "2021-03-23 17:04:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chugai-gains-japanese-nod-for-polivy-as-lymphoma-therapy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "chugai_kamakura_large.jpg", "image2id": "chugai_kamakura_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Japan", "company_tag": "Chugai, Roche", "drug_tag": "Polivy", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-23 16:57:00"}
