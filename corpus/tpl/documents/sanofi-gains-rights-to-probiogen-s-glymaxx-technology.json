{"contentid": 488067, "importid": NaN, "name": "Sanofi gains rights to ProBioGen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GlymaxX technology", "introduction": "German contract development and manufacturing company ProBioGen has signed a commercial multi-product license agreement with French pharma major Sanofi.", "content": "<p>German contract development and manufacturing company ProBioGen has signed a commercial multi-product license agreement with French pharma major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN).</p>\n<p>Under the accord, Sanofi will integrate ProBioGen&rsquo;s proprietary <a href=\"http://www.glymaxx.com/\">GlymaxX technology</a> into its product development strategy for an undisclosed number of antibody candidates across several business units. Financial terms of the collaboration were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>GlymaxX enables a boost of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), consequently leading to an elevated NK cell mediated killing activity of its target cells. The GlymaxX technology adds value to the products by significantly improving their potency and potentially reducing the overall clinical doses for patients, explains ProBioGen, which most recently also licensed the technology to Germany&rsquo;s Bayer (BAYN: DE).</p>\n<p>The proven GlymaxX technology for production of afucosylated proteins is widely applied in the pharma industry and hence used in various numbers of monoclonal antibody (Mab) candidates. It is universally applicable, simple and very potent.</p>\n<p>The unique advantage of the GlymaxX technology allows a single GlymaxX modified cell line to produce both, completely fucosylated and/or afucosylated antibodies and those with intermediate defined fuscosylation levels. The technology can be easily integrated in newly developed or already existing cell lines of different host cell origins, which demonstrates its great flexibility, the German firm noted.</p>", "date": "2021-03-17 14:55:00", "meta_title": "Sanofi gains rights to ProBioGen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GlymaxX technology", "meta_keywords": "ProBioGen, Sanofi, Agreement, License, Development, GlymaxX, Technology", "meta_description": "Sanofi gains rights to ProBioGen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GlymaxX technology", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-17 14:55:19", "updated": "2021-03-17 15:01:58", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-gains-rights-to-probiogen-s-glymaxx-technology", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "probiogen-big.png", "image2id": "probiogen-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "France, Germany", "company_tag": "ProBioGen, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "GlymaxX", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-17 14:55:00"}
