BridgeBio&rsquo;s shares closed up 2% at $59.20 following the announcement on Friday</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is an important milestone for patients diagnosed with FGFR2-fusion-driven cholangiocarcinoma who have recurred after first-line therapy and are in need of targeted options for further treatment,&rdquo; said Dr Susan Moran, chief medical officer for QED. &ldquo;Based on the efficacy seen to date, our team believes infigratinib possesses promise for a range of FGFR-driven conditions, including other cancers. We will continue to evaluate its safety and efficacy in these areas of unmet need,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Partnered with Helsinn</strong></h2>\n<p>In March this year, QED entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement with privately-held Swiss firm Helsinn to further develop and commercialize QED Therapeutics&rsquo; FGFR1-3 inhibitor, infigratinib, in oncology and all other indications except for skeletal dysplasias (including achondroplasia). Under the deal, BridgeBio is eligible to receive around $2.45 billion, including over $100 million in upfront.</p>\n<p>Additional marketing applications for infigratinib are currently under review in Australia and Canada under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA&rsquo;s Oncology Center of Excellence that allows for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p>The FDA also approved FoundationOne CDx (Foundation Medicine) for selection of patients with FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement as a companion diagnostic device for treatment with infigratinib.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>Efficacy was demonstrated in CBGJ398X2204 (NCT02150967), a multicenter open-label single-arm trial, that enrolled 108 patients with previously-treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement as determined by local or central testing. Patients received infigratinib 125mg orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by seven days off therapy, in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</p>\n<p>This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</p>", "date": "2021-05-29 15:31:00", "meta_title": "FDA accelerated appro for infigratinib in metastatic cholangiocarcinom", "meta_keywords": "BridgeBio Pharma, Helsinn, QED Therapeutics, Truseltiq, Infigratinib, Metastatic, Cholangiocarcinoma", "meta_description": "FDA accelerated appro for infigratinib in metastatic cholangiocarcinoma", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-29 15:30:25", "updated": "2021-05-29 15:39:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accelerated-appro-for-infigratinib-in-metastatic-cholangiocarcinoma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "bridgebio_large.png", "image2id": "bridgebio_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "BridgeBio Pharma, Helsinn Group, QED Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "infigratinib, Truseltiq", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": "Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma", "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-29 15:31:00"}
