The increased currency depreciation in key markets had an overall negative impact of 4% on sales growth, Lundbeck noted.</p>\n<p>President and chief executive Deborah Dunsire commented: &ldquo;Lundbeck continues to deliver robust financial performance in a world impacted by the pandemic still impeding patient&rsquo;s ability to seek care normally. We are very pleased to see good Vyepti growth in the U.S. as we are gradually able to return to more normal interaction with physicians. We are delighted with the new data on Brintellix/Trintellix, amplifying the strength of its profile as a great choice for people facing depression. Currency headwinds have been impactful as has the loss of exclusivity on Northera.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The financial guidance for 2021 is maintained.
