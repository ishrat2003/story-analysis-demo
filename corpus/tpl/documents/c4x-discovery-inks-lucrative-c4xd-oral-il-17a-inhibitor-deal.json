The IL-17 family of cytokines are strong inducers of inflammation and are implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Current treatments targeting IL-17 are monoclonal antibodies administered via an injection. There is an urgent need for safe and efficacious oral small molecule therapies to increase the number of patients able to access IL-17 targeted drugs and expand availability into new inflammatory disease indications.</p>\n<h2><strong>Can selectively block IL-17 activity</strong></h2>\n<p>C4XD&rsquo;s small molecule IL-17A inhibitor program can selectively block IL-17 activity in vivo whilst maintaining molecular size of the molecule in the traditional \"drug-like\" range suitable for oral administration. Sanofi will continue to work with the C4XD team to access its unique and proprietary 4D Conformetrix technology, as the program advances towards clinical studies.</p>\n<p>C4X Discovery chief executive Clive Dix commented: &ldquo;We are proud to be working with Sanofi to create much needed oral therapies in the underserved inflammatory disease space. While antibody therapies have demonstrated the potential of IL-17 inhibition in the generation of highly effective treatments, the injectable route means many patients currently do not have access to the medicines that can change their lives. We believe that our small molecule program has the potential to create high value, efficacious and convenient oral IL-17 therapeutics for this large market. The psoriasis market alone is estimated to be worth ~$24 billion per annum by 2027, and when combined with Sanofi&rsquo;s development expertise our program has the potential to address a number of indications.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He continued: &ldquo;This is the second significant agreement for a C4XD program and marks a major milestone for the company, not only validating the strength of our drug discovery expertise, but also our strategy to drive shareholder value through early-stage revenue generating deals. With Indivior progressing our molecule for opioid addiction through a Phase I clinical trial and now our partnership with Sanofi driving potential next generation oral IL-17 therapies, we look forward with confidence to</p>\n<p>further develop our portfolio and deliver additional novel small molecule drug candidates tackling significant patient needs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>C4XD&rsquo;s 2018 deal with Indivior (LSE: INDV) granted the fellow British company global rights to develop and commercialize C4XD's oral Orexin-1 receptor antagonist program for the treatment of addiction, for an upfront payment of $10 million and $284 million of potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestones in addition to royalties.</p>", "date": "2021-04-12 10:35:00", "meta_title": "C4X Discovery inks lucrative C4XD oral IL-17A inhibitor deal", "meta_keywords": "C4X Discovery, Sanofi, License, Agreement, IL-17A inhibitor, Program", "meta_description": "C4X Discovery inks lucrative C4XD oral IL-17A inhibitor deal", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-12 10:31:00", "updated": "2021-04-12 10:42:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/c4x-discovery-inks-lucrative-c4xd-oral-il-17a-inhibitor-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "c4xdbig.jpg", "image2id": "c4xdsmall.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "France, UK", "company_tag": "C4X Discovery, Sanofi", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-12 10:35:00"}
