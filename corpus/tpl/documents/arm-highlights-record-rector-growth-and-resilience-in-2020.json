Regulatory decisions are expected on a record eight new Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) &ndash; and on a total of 10 products across at least four geographies - in 2021, including Breyanzi, a Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) CAR-T therapy for relapsed or refractory large (lisocabtagene maraleucel) B-cell lymphoma that already received FDA approval in February.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When COVID-19 struck, we joined the rest of the world in not knowing what 2020 would bring,&rdquo; said Janet Lambert, chief executive of the ARM. &ldquo;Instead, not even a global pandemic could derail the scientific advancements, investor appetite, and maturing pipeline that made headlines for the ATMP sector in 2020. For a once aspirational sector, the future is now,&rdquo; she noted.</p>\n<p>It was a significant year of growth for the ARM as well. The global voice of the sector grew by 80 members, reaching a total global membership of more than 380 organizations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-16 16:47:00", "meta_title": "ARM highlights record rector growth and resilience in 2020", "meta_keywords": "Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, Annual report, 2020, Approvals, Achievements, Orchard Thera, Libmeldy, Gilead, Tecartus, Bristol Myers Squibb, Breyanzi", "meta_description": "ARM highlights record rector growth and resilience in 2020", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-16 16:46:15", "updated": "2021-03-16 16:57:58", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/arm-highlights-record-rector-growth-and-resilience-in-2020", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "stem_cell.jpg", "image2id": "stem_cell_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Regenerative Medicine", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Orchard Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "Breyanzi, Libmeldy, Tecartus", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-16 16:47:00"}
