AA is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that can progress. Baricitinib has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AA.</p>\n<p>There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for AA, a disease that affects as many as 147 million people worldwide. The sell-side forecasts Olumiant sales of $1.2 billion in 2026, according to <em>EvaluatePharma </em>consensus, but none of this is expected to come in alopecia.</p>\n<p>These latest data have failed to excite the market, as Lilly&rsquo;s shares edged down 0.9% to $202.27, and Incyte was 1.7% lower at $77.11 on Wednesday.</p>\n<h2><strong>&ldquo;Potential to address the urgent needs&rdquo;</strong></h2>\n<p>\"These positive results are very promising and suggest that baricitinib has the potential to address the urgent needs of people living with alopecia areata,\" said Dr Brett King, professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. \"This level of high-quality research is needed to advance our understanding and the treatment of this frequently devastating disease,\" he noted.</p>\n<p>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 546 adults with a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score &ge; 50 (i.e., who had &ge;50% scalp hair loss) and a current episode of severe AA lasting at least six months but no more than eight years. The study included a diverse patient population from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA.</p>\n<p>Safety outcomes of baricitinib in BRAVE-AA2 were consistent with its established safety profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). No deaths, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were reported in the study.</p>\n<p>\"For patients who suffer from alopecia areata, it is not a cosmetic condition, it is a devastating autoimmune disease that can have significant psychological effects. They lose much more than just hair,\" said Dr Lotus Mallbris, vice president of immunology development at Lilly, adding: \"We are looking forward to sharing the totality of data from the overall clinical development program for baricitinib as a potential first-in-disease treatment for alopecia areata.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Baricitinib is also being investigated in systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and COVID-19.</p>", "date": "2021-03-04 12:26:00", "meta_title": "First JAK-inhibitor to show hair regrowth in Phase III alopecia trial", "meta_keywords": "Incyte, Eli Lilly, Baricitinib, Olumient, JAK-inhibitor, Phase III, Alopecia areata", "meta_description": "First JAK-inhibitor to show hair regrowth in Phase III alopecia trial", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-04 12:24:52", "updated": "2021-03-04 12:34:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/first-jak-inhibitor-to-show-hair-regrowth-in-phase-iii-alopecia-trial", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "lilly-incyte-big.png", "image2id": "lilly-incyte-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Hair diseases", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, Incyte", "drug_tag": "baricitinib, Olumiant", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-04 12:26:00"}
