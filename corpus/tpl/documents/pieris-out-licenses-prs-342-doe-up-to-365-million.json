Pieris will receive an upfront payment of $10 million and is further entitled to receive up to approximately $353 million in development, regulatory, and sales-based milestone payments, and tiered royalties on sales of PRS-342. Pieris will also contribute an undisclosed amount toward manufacturing activities.</p>\n<p>\"Based on the encouraging pre-clinical data from PRS-342, as well as data demonstrative of the 4-1BB mechanism of action we have seen from Pieris' other immuno-oncology programs, we are excited to have the opportunity on a global scale to progress this program into clinical development in areas of significant unmet need,\" said Robert Armstrong, chief executive of Boston Pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<p>\"Our recent presentations at AACR for our HER2- and PD-L1-targeting 4-1BB bispecifics demonstrate the potency of our costimulatory approach, especially our bispecific antibodies' ability to achieve clinical benefit, including in patients who have failed checkpoint therapy. It is therefore rewarding to see another one of our 4-1BB-based Anticalin bispecifics for immuno-oncology moving towards the clinic,\" said Stephen Yoder, president and CEO of Pieris, noting that \"Boston Pharmaceuticals has a strong leadership team and proven track record of developing a broad range of assets, including in oncology, and we look forward to the advancement of this next-generation bispecific and to directly supporting some crucial next steps towards clinical initiation.\"</p>", "date": "2021-04-26 14:43:00", "meta_title": "Pieris out-licenses PRS-342 doe up to $365 million", "meta_keywords": "Pieris Pharmaceuticals, PRS-342, License, Agreement, Boston Pharmaceutucals, Anticalin-antibody", "meta_description": "Pieris out-licenses PRS-342 doe up to $365 million", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-26 14:43:02", "updated": "2021-04-26 14:57:12", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pieris-out-licenses-prs-342-doe-up-to-365-million", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "pieris-large.jpg", "image2id": "pieris-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Boston Pharmaceuticals, Pieris Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "PRS-342", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-26 14:43:00"}
