This decision is not a reflection of the awardee or product, rather a fast-moving environment associated with the former Operation Warp Speed on decisions related to future products.\"</p>\n<p>This decision does not impact other work that Inovio does with the US government and is neither a result of the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-hitch-for-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-ino-4800-phase-ii-iii-trial\">partial clinical hold</a> imposed by the Food and Drug Administration last year, nor a reflection of the data generated to date for INO-4800 vaccine.</p>\n<p>Inovio continues to evaluate its pan-COVID variant vaccine, INO-4802, to protect against current and future variants of concern, as well as assessing boosting capabilities for INO-4800. Inovio remains well-positioned to support both pandemic and endemic vaccine needs with INO-4800 and INO-4802.
