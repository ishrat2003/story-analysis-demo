Just last month, Teon announced the completion of a $30 million Series A financing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the clinical development partnership, Cancer Research UK will sponsor the first-in-human Phase I/II clinical trial of TT-702, which will be led by a team at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TT-702 targets cancer&rsquo;s ability to evade the human immune response, enabling the immune system to expose and then destroy cancer cells. The hope is that TT-702 could be used to treat patients with advanced hard-to-treat solid tumors, including metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, which is an aggressive form of cancer which has progressed despite surgery and hormone therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s Centre for Drug Development will work closely with Teon throughout the collaboration and share clinical insights as they emerge to help guide TT-702&rsquo;s future development strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Terms of the accord</strong></h2>\n<p>Teon retains the rights to further develop and commercialize TT-702 and will receive the results of the clinical trial from Cancer Research UK in return for undisclosed success-based milestone and royalty payments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Centre for Drug Development, Teon, and a team of clinical investigators led by Professor Johann de Bono are currently preparing to open a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Commenting on the growing interest in the role of adenosine in cancer, Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Jacob Plieth noted that Spain&rsquo;s Palobiofarma has a pipeline of adenosine antagonists that includes the A2B-specific molecule PBF-1129, which is in two Phase I trials in lung and other solid tumors.
