Pre-clinical data generated by Adagio and validated by the University of Oxford in a recent Cell manuscript, show that ADG20 uniquely combines potency, breadth and complete neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and all currently known variants of concern.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Phase I study initiated</strong></h2>\n<p>Adagio has initiated a Phase I study of ADG20 in healthy volunteers and a pivotal Phase I/II/III clinical trial in high-risk individuals with mild or moderate COVID-19, the <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04805671?term=ADG20&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\">STAMP trial</a>. The trial is strategically designed to enable the rapid advancement of ADG20 to proof-of-concept data, which if positive, are intended to support an Emergency Use Authorization submission. In addition, the company is on track to initiate a third clinical trial in the second quarter of 2021, evaluating ADG20 for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a major health crisis worldwide, and even with emergency use authorizations for vaccines and antibody-based therapies, there remains a significant need for medications to treat and prevent COVID-19 infection. We are advancing ADG20 through a rapid development strategy based on pre-clinical data that demonstrate its best-in-class potential for treating all known variants of COVID-19 today,&rdquo; said Tillman Gerngross, co-founder and chief executive of Adagio.</p>", "date": "2021-04-19 12:23:00", "meta_title": "Adagio Thera nabs $336 million financing to progress ADG20 antibody", "meta_keywords": "Adagio Therapeutics, ADG20, Financing, Series C, Antibody, COVID-19, Prevention", "meta_description": "Adagio Thera nabs $336 million financing to progress ADG20 antibody", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-19 12:22:46", "updated": "2021-04-19 17:23:52", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/adagio-thera-nabs-336-million-financing-to-progress-adg20-antibody", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "adagio_big.jpg", "image2id": "adagio_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Business Financing, Coronavirus, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Adagio Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "ADG20", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-19 12:23:00"}
