{"contentid": 487954, "importid": NaN, "name": "Novartis in deal to make CureVac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine candidate", "introduction": "In yet another collaboration by big pharm to help ensure production of vaccines to deal with the current pandemic, Swiss pharma giant Novartis yesterday announced its signing an initial agreement to manufacture the mRNA and bulk drug product for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate CVnCoV from German biotech CureVac.", "content": "<p>In yet another collaboration by big pharm to help ensure production of vaccines to deal with the current pandemic, Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) yesterday announced its signing an initial agreement to manufacture the mRNA and bulk drug product for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate CVnCoV from German biotech CureVac (Nasdaq: CVAC).</p>\n<p>Preparations for the start of production, technology transfer and test runs are already underway. Following final agreement, Novartis plans to start production in the second quarter of 2021. First deliveries of the bulk drug product to CureVac are expected in the summer 2021.</p>\n<p>Production will take place in a new high-tech production facility that was already under construction at the Novartis Kundl, Austria site. This will be adapted to the needs of messenger RNA vaccine production for CureVac&rsquo;s CVnCoV, the manufacturing of which is highly complex. Novartis plans to produce up to 50 million doses of the mRNA and bulk drug product for the CureVac vaccine in 2021 and up to a further 200 million doses in 2022. The bulk drug product will then be delivered to CureVac for further processing and filling.</p>\n<h2><strong>CureVac collaborations</strong></h2>\n<p>CureVac has a previous production deal for its CVnCoCoV with contract manufacturer Rentschler Biopharma. In January it reached a deal with fellow German firm Bayer (BAYN: DE) to advance its CVnCoV, under which Bayer holds options to become the marketing authorization holder in other markets outside of Europe.</p>\n<p>Also, UK pharma major GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) last month entered a 150 million-euro ($180.5 million) collaboration CureVac, building on their existing relationship, to jointly develop next generation mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential for a multi-valent approach to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine.</p>\n<p>Dr Florian von der M&uuml;lbe, chief production officer of CureVac, said: &ldquo;I am very pleased that with Novartis we have found another highly experienced partner to support the production of our vaccine candidate. Together with Novartis we expect to increase significantly our manufacturing capacity and place our production network on an even broader base.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Novartis response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong></h2>\n<p>Novartis says it is making a number of contributions to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting the stability of global health systems. The company recently announced an initial agreement with BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX) to provide manufacturing capacity for a COVID-19 vaccination at its site in Stein, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID8.</p>", "date": "2021-03-05 10:09:00", "meta_title": "Novartis in deal to make CureVac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine candidate", "meta_keywords": "Novartis, CureVac, COVID-19 vaccine, CVnCoV, Production, mRNA, Bulk drug", "meta_description": "Novartis in deal to make CureVac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine candidate", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-05 10:02:00", "updated": "2021-03-05 10:10:00", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-in-deal-to-make-curevac-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "curevacbig.jpg", "image2id": "curevacsmall.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On, Production", "geography_tag": "Germany, Switzerland", "company_tag": "CureVac, Novartis", "drug_tag": "CVnCoV", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-05 10:09:00"}
