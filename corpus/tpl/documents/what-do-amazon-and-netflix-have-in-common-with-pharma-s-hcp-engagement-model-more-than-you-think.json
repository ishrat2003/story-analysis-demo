A single source is expected to provide any product imaginable to any doorstep, within days, with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>Netflix has equally changed the entertainment industry by providing on demand access to the latest content, making recommendations for new shows that may be of interest based on prior activity. What do these trends have to do with the pharmaceutical industry? It is all connected. Health care providers (HCPs), who are consumers in their own right, have come to expect the same contextually rich, personalized customer experience they get in their personal lives from their pharmaceutical partner &ndash; and they want it easily accessible on their phones and computers.</p>\n<h2>The importance of personalized HCP engagements</h2>\n<p>There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of information being pushed to HCPs by pharmaceutical companies across digital channels, making it imperative to identify ways to stand out. The old standby of pushing out volumes of information to the broadest group of HCPs to gain adoption is no longer viable.</p>\n<p>Sending personalized and relevant content is key to high engagement. Many large global enterprises are challenged not only by communicating across sales and marketing silos within their own organizations, but also by streamlining communication so customers receive a harmonized and relevant message from different departments in a coordinated manner. Technology is becoming the critical tool for sales representatives to successfully engage based on insight. Operationalizing analytics throughout the enterprise to deliver the most relevant message on the best channel at the most opportune time is paramount. This is just one way that technology can help pharmaceutical companies deliver positive and successful engagements with HCPs.</p>\n<h2>Optimizing HCP engagements</h2>\n<p>Since pharmaceutical sales representatives have a brief window of time with which they can connect with HCPs, it is essential that the message they are sending resonates with their audience based on current needs and historical behaviors. Consumers and business professionals alike receive a lot of junk email these days and are learning to ignore noise and spam in their inboxes. Failing to take a strategic approach to digital HCP engagements is a surefire way to end up in the junk or deleted folder. For digital engagements to be effective, representatives must ensure that interactions are not only personalized, but also contextually relevant.</p>\n<p>Modern technology learns over time what the HCP is looking for, much like Netflix recommends new content based on the past viewer activity. These learnings translate to actionable recommendations for representatives surrounding what action, communication channel, and piece of information will best resonate with their HCP customers for their next interaction. Other demographic information from HCPs can also be used to optimize engagements. For example, geo-location data can be used to optimize call patterns for a representative during a day of planned meetings based on the time zones their customers are in. This way, calls are made during business hours for both the HCP and the representative, including where to make an additional stop if time opens up due to schedule changes.</p>\n<p>In this manner, technology increases productivity of sales representatives by providing recommendations and suggestions to improve their HCP engagement, while simultaneously automating less urgent tasks.</p>\n<h2>Connecting compliantly with HCPs</h2>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies are required to adhere to stringent communications guidelines on how they talk about their products with HCPs, sharing only approved information. They must also get approval and document any engagements with key opinion leaders (KOLs), as well as report associated payment.</p>\n<p>As representatives connect HCPs with the right content and scientific experts, they are keenly aware of these guidelines surrounding every communication they and other experts have with customers. Without a layer of protection as representatives lean more into digital practices, companies could find themselves out of regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies are moving to digital and virtual customer engagement platforms as well, such as social media, automated assistants, and live chat functions. These channels all need to be compliant with regulatory and data privacy requirements. There is a delicate but vital balance where organizations must deliver an exceptional customer experience designed so that regulatory-approved data and information can flow easily while ensuring appropriate firewalls are in place to protect information.</p>\n<p>For this reason, companies require solutions that are uniquely built for this complex industry. Their tools must be able to keep up with the real-time rules of information sharing as they change and centralize the communication and coordination of all HCP interaction processes. It is also important that they have partners that not only have expertise in developing and deploying digital solutions but a deep understanding of the ins and outs of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<p>Keeping up with consistently changing global transparency legislation, regulations and codes is a major challenge for life sciences companies of any size. By injecting real-time information collection into their digital strategy, any organization can easily achieve global coverage, compliance monitoring, and upstream data validation to keep pace with these changes while delivering personalized and relevant interactions. All this, without placing significant burden on their representatives.</p>\n<h2>The future of the HCP engagement model</h2>\n<p>In the same way that consumer entertainment preferences evolve over time, commercial content must also change to keep HCPs engaged in the manner they are accustomed to today. When broadcast television was first introduced, it was a life-changing development for the amount and type of content everyday consumers could experience. Today&rsquo;s streaming platforms and on-demand services like Netflix and Prime Video have raised consumers&rsquo; standards for how they spend their time watching and when they watch it.</p>\n<p>The same is true for scientific information that for so long had been shared in black and white flat file format. It&rsquo;s not unrealistic to expect that as we evolve to consume all content in smaller bites, HCPs want to extract, retain, and reference the important information in a given piece of content more quickly and easily. The next major opportunity for curated content evolution will be for pharmaceutical teams to infuse content formats with creative tweaks to make it more dynamic and compelling for those who need to digest it. This could include new technologies such as augmented or virtual reality, or even simple interactive &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; type content that presents HCPs with only the most critical information for their current predicament.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are finding their way into mainstream business applications and processes, even in the historically change-averse life sciences sector. When embedded in workflow technologies, companies benefit from the insights surfaced to make smarter decisions and predictions to yield the best possible outcomes from customer engagements. As new technologies emerge, interoperability will be key to get the most impact across digital investments. And as care and medicine as we know it evolves to a more patient-centric model, there is no doubt that the &lsquo;blue sky thinking&rsquo; of digital customer experience innovators will continue to shape progress in the industry and redefine HCP engagement for the foreseeable future.</p>", "date": "2021-05-20 18:00:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "digital, HCPs, companies, information, content, pharmaceutical, engagements, representatives, Amazon, buying, engagement, time, Netflix, based, personalize", "meta_description": "AJ Ploszay, VP of digital strategy, IQVIA, provides an Expert View on how the precedent for consumer buying set by companies like Amazon, further accelerated by", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-20 17:39:28", "updated": "2021-05-24 13:24:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/what-do-amazon-and-netflix-have-in-common-with-pharma-s-hcp-engagement-model-more-than-you-think", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "amazon_big.jpg", "image2id": "amazon_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Digital Pharma, Expert View, Focus On, Health Medical Pharma, In Depth", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "IQVIA INC.", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-20 18:00:00"}
