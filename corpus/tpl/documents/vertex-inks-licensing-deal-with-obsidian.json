Obsidian is eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion in potential payments based upon the successful achievement of specified research, development, regulatory, and commercial milestones across up to five potential programs. In addition, Vertex will pay tiered royalties on future net sales on any products that may result from this collaboration. Specific diseases that are the subject of this collaboration are not disclosed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This collaboration with Obsidian builds upon and will expand Vertex&rsquo;s leadership in small molecule and genetic therapies, and we&rsquo;re excited to partner with the team at Obsidian to explore the capabilities of their technology,&rdquo; said Vertex&rsquo; executive vice president, global research, and chief scientific officer David Altshuler, adding: &ldquo;The ability to tune gene-editing activity to a specific level is an important innovation that has the potential to address several serious diseases.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At Obsidian, we&rsquo;re using our cytoDRiVE technology to pioneer a new generation of engineered cell and gene therapies for patients with serious diseases,&rdquo; said Paul Wotton, chief executive of Obsidian Therapeutics. &ldquo;Partnering with Vertex, an established leader at the forefront of genetic therapies, will further advance our technology into the gene therapy field and accelerate development of controllable gene editing therapies for patients,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Obsidian will use its cytoDRiVE technology to develop novel regulated gene editing therapy candidates for multiple serious diseases. Obsidian grants Vertex the exclusive option to license worldwide rights to candidates discovered and developed under the collaboration. Following Vertex&rsquo;s exercise of its options, Vertex will be responsible for further preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.</p>", "date": "2021-04-23 14:15:00", "meta_title": "Vertex inks licensing deal with Obsidian", "meta_keywords": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Obsidian Therapeutics, Liense, Agreement, cytiDRiVe, Research", "meta_description": "Vertex inks licensing deal with Obsidian", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-23 14:14:21", "updated": "2021-04-23 14:22:34", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/vertex-inks-licensing-deal-with-obsidian", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vertex_large.jpg", "image2id": "vertex_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Obsidian Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-23 14:15:00"}
