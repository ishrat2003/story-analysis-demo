This assessment was performed at 12 months and compared to the study eye of patients randomized to the untreated control group. Positive trends were observed across several clinically relevant prespecified secondary endpoints.</p>\n<h2><strong>Drug came with Nightstar acquisition</strong></h2>\n<p>Cotoretigene toliparvovec is one of two clinical-stage gene therapies that came to Biogen via its $877 million <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-to-acquire-rare-inherited-retinal-disease-drug-developer\">acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics</a> in 2019. The other gene therapy in that deal, timrepigene emparvovec, is currently in Phase III testing as a potential treatment for choroideremia, another rare inherited retinal disease.</p>\n<p>XLRP is a rare, inherited retinal disease that is associated with progressive vision loss as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Initial symptoms are difficulty seeing at night, followed by restriction of the field of vision and eventually blindness in most people by the age of 40. Patients living with XLRP currently have no approved treatments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Although the Phase II/III XIRIUS study of cotoretigene toliparvovec did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by positive trends in other pre-specified clinically relevant endpoints, such as a measure of visual acuity under low light conditions,&rdquo; said Dr Katherine Dawson, head of the therapeutics development unit at Biogen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;XLRP is a serious, early-onset form of retinitis pigmentosa, and people living with it face almost certain blindness by the end of the fourth decade, commonly leading to loss of independence, depression and unemployment. We are working to further evaluate the data from the XIRIUS study before communicating potential next steps for the cotoretigene toliparvovec clinical development program,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>Most adverse events were ocular in nature, mild-to-moderate in severity, and resolved., the company noted.</p>", "date": "2021-05-15 15:45:00", "meta_title": "Disappointing results from Biogen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gene therapy study for XLRP", "meta_keywords": "Biogen, Phase II/III, Gene therapy, Cotoretigene toliparvovec, Retinitis pigmentosa, X-linked, XLRP, Endpoint, Nightstar", "meta_description": "Disappointing results from Biogen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gene therapy study for XLRP", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-15 15:44:09", "updated": "2021-05-15 15:55:18", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/disappointing-results-from-biogen-s-gene-therapy-study-for-xlrp", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biogen_large.jpg", "image2id": "biogen_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Ophthalmics", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Biogen, Nightstar Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "cotoretigene toliparvovec, timrepigene emparvovec", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-15 15:45:00"}
