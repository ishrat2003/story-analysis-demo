It actually lifts a part of this additional burden imposed by the State, in exchange for the creation of new jobs, research and development in Greece, showcasing the Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) investment in Thessaloniki as a first successful example of this investment instrument.</p>\n<p>SFEE president Olympios Papadimitriou noted that the adoption of the investment clawback is an important incentive for investments to be attracted in Greece. He reported extensively the lessons taught, originally during the financial crisis and then through the COVID-19 crisis, both at European and national level, where, amongst others, the necessity for an effective use of public resources, the enhancement of primary health care and the creation of digital/remote systems was proven.</p>\n<h2><strong>Pharma&rsquo;s added value to Greek economy</strong></h2>\n<p>He referred to the added value created in Greek economy by the pharmaceutical industry, contributing a 6.7 billion ($8.13 billion) for 2019, ie, accounting for 3.6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In terms of employment, the pharmaceutical industry secures 135,000 jobs &ndash; ie, 3.9% of total labor &ndash; most of them being of high specialization, while contributing annually to the national economy about 2 billion euros in taxes and social contributions. Hence, the pharmaceutical industry constitutes one of the main pillars for the development of the country.</p>\n<p>In concluding, he referred to the challenges the industry and the state will be facing the day after COVID-19, as well as and the need to create &ldquo;a culture of national innovation&rdquo; and have it prevail in the country. &ldquo;We must develop a culture of national innovation in our country, enhance incentives for the attraction of investments and improve the system funding in tandem, for the latter to become more sustainable and foreseeable. This is the main quest of the companies of the sector, for them to be able to enhance their presence in the country and contribution in the national economy,&rdquo; noted Mr Papadimitriou.</p>", "date": "2021-05-17 17:11:00", "meta_title": "Greek trade group SFEE reports on 6th Delphi Economic Forum", "meta_keywords": "Greece, SFEE, Delphi Economic Forum, Investment, Innovation, Healthcare, Economy, Clawbacks", "meta_description": "Greek trade group SFEE reports on 6th Delphi Economic Forum", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-16 13:50:43", "updated": "2021-05-17 17:11:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/greek-trade-group-sfee-reports-on-6th-delphi-economic-forum", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "greece_greek_big.jpg", "image2id": "greece_greek_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Focus On, Government Affairs, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Public health", "geography_tag": "Greece", "company_tag": "SFEE", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-17 17:11:00"}
