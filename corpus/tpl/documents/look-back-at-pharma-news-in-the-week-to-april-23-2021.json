Editor</p>\n<p>Notable news last week included Australia&rsquo;s Kazia Therapeutics entering a licensing deal with Germany&rsquo;s Evotec for worldwide rights to cancer candidate EVT801. French vaccine specialist Valneva has started Phase III evaluation of its COVID-19 candidate VLA200 in the UK. US biotech bluebird bio gave an update on its genetic disease portfolio last Tuesday and said it was withdrawing its beta thalassemia drug Zynteglo from the German market due to failed price negotiations. GlaxoSmithKline was granted US Food and Drug Administration approval for its checkpoint blocker Jemperli. Also, on Friday the FDA lifted its pause on the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Kazia Therapeutics: New asset to target tumor lymphangiogenesis</strong></h2>\n<p>Kazia announced that it has licensed the compound EVT801 from Evotec. The deal included 1 million euros ($1.2 million) upfront for Evotec, 308 million euros in milestones, and tiered single-digit royalties. Kazia will assume all development, regulatory and marketing responsibilities, commented Edison Group analysts</p>\n<p>However, Kazia noted that it would be collaborating with Evotec and will have access to Evotec resources such as clinical trial management and manufacturing as part of a services agreement. The company noted that the initial focus of development will be for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS).</p>\n<p>Strategically, this is an important deal for Kazia, because it enables it to expand the pipeline to multiple drugs. Paxalisib will remain the lead asset, but most of the operational burden of that development is borne by the investigators running GBM AGILE. This leaves capacity for the company to expand its offering.</p>\n<p>The analysts have increased their valuation to A$346 million ($268 million) or A$2.68 per basic share from A$301 million or A$2.32 per basic share due to the new drug (initial valuation of A$47.2 million). This has also increased expected R&amp;D spending significantly and their financing requirement for the company to A$50 million (including A$30 million in FY23) from A$10 million, previously.</p>\n<h2><strong>Valneva joins the Phase III COVID-19 vaccine club</strong></h2>\n<p>As the world awaits pivotal US data on Novavax&rsquo; COVID-19 jab, plenty of other players are still trying to get in on the second wave of vaccines, said Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage. One of the latest, Valneva pushed VLA2001 into a pivotal UK study, while Ocugen hopes that its contender, Covaxin, could get the nod in the US on the back of data from a Phase III trial in India. The latter&rsquo;s share price climbed 18% yesterday.</p>\n<p>Both vaccines are based on inactivated coronavirus, making them different from currently authorised shots. With concerns over unusual blood clots with adenoviral vector-based vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, perhaps it is not too late for some of the Covid-19 vaccine laggards to make a mark, especially if booster doses are eventually needed. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Valneva has beaten some more experienced players to Phase III. Its study will compare the immune response with VLA2001 versus that seen with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Vaxzevria in 4,000 UK participants.</p>\n<p>One question is whether this trial will support approval outside the UK, but maybe this will not matter to Valneva for now. Only the UK has gone big on VLA2001 so far, ordering 100 million doses. The company <a href=\"https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-switches-focus-to-bilateral-discussions-to-supply-its-inactivated-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-vla2001/\">recently ditched discussions with the European Commission</a>, citing lack of progress, and hopes to sell its project to individual EU member states and countries outside the EU.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zynteglo marketing update incremental; clinical hold resolution remains focus</strong></h2>\n<p>bluebird bio announced last Tuesday the decision to withdraw Zynteglo from the German market after the company could not reach a reimbursement agreement with Germany that reflected Zynteglo&rsquo;s value for treatment of transfusion-dependent &beta;-thalassemia (TDT), noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Dr Mani Foroohar.</p>\n<p>The decision does not change our estimates, as we assumed a prolonged pause in marketing of Zynteglo following suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions reported in the sickle cell clinical program, and assumed sales would resume in 2022. Negotiations continue in additional European geographies, and reimbursement in areas of greater TDT prevalence (Italy, for example) will be key drivers of the revenue opportunity (though he notes that, in any scenario, the sickle cell opportunity remains the primary area of investor focus). Dr Foroohar makes no changes to his model at this time, and maintain his Outperform rating on BLUE shares.</p>\n<p>Leerink spoke to bluebird management, and expects that Germany as a market can be considered off of the table for the time being. Negotiations are continuing in other European countries, and it would expect additional updates in the second half of 2021. Germany is a small market for TDT and harbors few patients (for epidemiological reasons), and discontinuation/delay of TDT sales in Germany has a negligible impact on the overall opportunity. On the other hand, TDT is prevalent in Italy and Greece and maintaining pricing that reflects the value of Zynteglo in these geographies will be crucial to realizing long-term sales projections and protecting the market positioning for the sickle cell indication, in our view. Dr Foroohar looks to resolution of the clinical hold and further updates on EU commercialization as the next key events for bluebird shares.</p>\n<h2><strong>Jemperli arrives just as accelerated approvals face a grilling</strong></h2>\n<p>With last Thursday&rsquo;s green light for GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s dostarlimab, some five months late owing to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the industry has its seventh US-approved anti-PD-(L)1 drug, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>The initial use, second-line mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancer, is a small niche, and Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda can already be given for second-line MSI-high/mismatch repair-deficient cancers &ndash; irrespective of tumour type. Immediate winners are Roche, whose Ventana MMR RxDx companion diagnostic is concurrently approved, and Anaptysbio, which scored a $20 million milestone payment; GlaxoSmithKline investors might now wonder how long it will be before dostarlimab, now branded Jemperli, generates the cash flow to cover the milestone. <em>Evaluate Pharma</em> sell-side consensus sees Jemperli revenues rising from an anemic $37 million this year to $546 million in 2026. The conditional approval came five days before a US adcom seeking to scrutinize the ongoing accelerated approvals of anti-PD-(L)1 drugs whose confirmatory studies have failed. As a just-published <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/thought-leadership/vantage/evaluate-vantage-report-us-approvals-under-spotlight\">report from <em>Evaluate Vantage</em></a> reveals, this conditional pathway has found particular favor with anti-PD-(L)1 drugs, with Keytruda alone having 18 accelerated approvals to its name, 11 of which remain unconfirmed. Jemperli plus chemo is in RUT, a controlled Phase III cancer study that might be used to confirm yesterday&rsquo;s approval.</p>\n<p>Also commenting, Pharmaphorum noted that, after a string of disappointments including the failure of bintrafusp alfa, a drug developed with Germany&rsquo;s Merck KGaA in lung cancer, any approval is welcome news. While some argued that GSK overpaid for Tesaro in 2018, at least the deal is bringing badly needed new drugs to market for the under-pressure UK pharma and its highly-paid research chief Hal Barron.</p>\n<p>Jemperli has been approved in a niche where there are few available options, in women whose endometrial cancer has progressed on or after platinum chemotherapy and whose cancers have a biomarker known as a mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR).</p>\n<p>Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is the top seller and while it&rsquo;s unlikely Jemperli will generate the level of blockbuster revenues, GSK needs to get drugs approved to boost confidence in its pipeline.</p>\n<h2><strong>ACIP recommends J&amp;J vax again; CDC and FDA provide cautions but no restrictions</strong></h2>\n<p>On Friday, the CDC&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/in-brief/brief-us-pause-on-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-lifted\">reinstate its recommendation on Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</a> for all adults without any specific restrictions by age or gender, commented analysts at SVB Leerink Research.</p>\n<p>The CDC and FDA are planning to communicate the risks of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)/ Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) in updated patient and physician information brochures and a new edition of MMWR early next week. The rate of this rare severe complication appears to be 1 in 143k vaccinees for women under 50 years of age, which the panel agreed was much lower than the rate of other rare but severe vaccine adverse events, and lower than the rate of complications of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The panel&rsquo;s recommendation appears to prioritize public health and social objectives over individual safety concerns, which may turn out to be controversial as anti-vax sentiment gathers momentum and could relegate J&amp;J primarily to emerging markets and poorly resourced environments in the USA, where risk/reward remains compelling.</p>\n<p>For the time being at least, J&amp;J will be back in the market (assuming supply from their European facility), somewhat reducing the volume windfall for mRNA vaccine manufacturers. Reinstatement could have favorable regulatory read-through for AZN, especially given factors considered by the panel including ease of storage, distribution, and administration, attributes also shared by AZN&rsquo;s vaccine. We expect this re-recommendation will reverse momentum in the mRNA stocks that have been on a dramatic upward swing in April with ~$50 billion total market cap gain across BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer, and CurVac.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly for J&amp;J, this is the best-case scenario as it can return to market without restrictions. That said, the two biggest questions in the analysts&rsquo; minds gating US adoption are: (1) Willingness to adopt, as these negative headlines only exacerbate vaccination fears; and (2) ability to supply given recent 483 at supplier Emergent Biosciences. As it relates to the former, they do think given the ease of distribution and single-shot profile, J&amp;J&rsquo;s vaccine will be adopted in the more difficult-to-reach communities and populations and &mdash; beyond the US &mdash; developing countries.</p>\n<p>And, from a manufacturing perspective, J&amp;J has capacity at its Netherlands facility, while simultaneously working with Emergent to resolve FDA&rsquo;s issues and other companies to secure additional supply contracts. Given that JNJ is selling not-for-profit and the company has already realized significant costs in 2020 that won't carry into 2021, we expect any negative impact on P&amp;L, if any, to be immaterial, and marginally incremental upside to revenue in 2021.</p>", "date": "2021-04-25 11:15:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 23, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Kazia Therapeutics, Evotec, EVT801, Valneva, VLA200, bluebird bio, Zynteglo, GlaxoSmithKline, Jemperi, Johnson & Johnson, COVID-19 Janssen", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 23, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-25 11:13:27", "updated": "2021-04-25 14:43:02", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-23-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Infectious diseases, Oncology, Rare diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Deals, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "bluebird bio, Evotec, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Kazia Therapeutics, Valneva", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, EVT801, Jemperli, VLA2001, Zynteglo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-25 11:15:00"}
