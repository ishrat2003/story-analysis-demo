The technology stands out because of its ability to rapidly deliver T-cell engagers that balance high potency, efficacy, and specificity with optimal patient safety.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to close this financing round with a top-tier investor syndicate who recognize the potential of our TRACTr technology to engineer best-in-class T cell engagers to provide better outcomes for cancer patients,&rdquo; said David Campbell, president and chief executive of Janux Therapeutics. &ldquo;With this financing, we&rsquo;re focused on advancing our deep pipeline of T cell engager immunotherapies for the treatment of various cancers. We anticipate that the first of several development candidates will be entering the clinic next year for a solid tumor indication,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;T-cells are the most potent killers of tumor cells within the immune system, but directing, controlling, and integrating that activity is the key to next generation immunotherapies,&rdquo; said Jay Lichter, managing partner of Avalon Ventures, adding that &ldquo;Janux&rsquo; TRACTr technology offers the potential to balance T-cell potency with specificity with the goal of generating immunotherapies with optimal safety, efficacy, and specificity.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-04 14:09:00", "meta_title": "Janux raises $56 million to take \u00e2\u0080\u0098TRACTr\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tech to the clinic", "meta_keywords": "Janux Therapeutics, Financing, Series A, T-cell, Engager, TRACTr technology", "meta_description": "Janux raises $56 million to take \u00e2\u0080\u0098TRACTr\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tech to the clinic", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-04 14:08:19", "updated": "2021-03-04 14:16:57", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/janux-raises-56-million-to-take-tractr-tech-to-the-clinic", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "money_drugs_scales_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "money_drugs_scales_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Immunotherapies", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immunologicals", "topic_tag": "Business Financing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Janux Therapeutics", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-04 14:09:00"}
