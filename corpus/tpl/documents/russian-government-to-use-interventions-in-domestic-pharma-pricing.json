An initiative to extend the mechanism to medicines was put forward last year after the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In November 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Trade announced the formation of a list of drugs that could be purchased by the government for state reserves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 20% growth of prices for them will provide an opportunity for regional authorities to contact the federal government with regard to beginning of possible interventions in the domestic market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, some leading Russian analysts in the field of pharmaceutics generally support the new initiative. As Sergey Shulyak, head of DSM Group, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading pharma analyst agencies said in an interview with the Russian Kommersant business paper, the idea is not new, as the national government has already attempted to make such drug reserves in the past, particularly after the beginning of bird flu pandemic. However, according to analysts, that measures did not result in a significant reduction of drug prices in the domestic market at that time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other interviewed experts also remain skeptical about planned state interventions in the domestic pharmaceutical market. According to head of the Russian Association of Pharmaceutical Companies \"Inform,\" Vadim Kukava, since the Russian drug market already has a mechanism for fixing prices for drugs from the list of \"vital\" medicines the creation of a state reserve only makes sense to reduce prices in the retail segment of the market.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 10:21:00", "meta_title": "Russian government to use interventions in domestic pharma pricing", "meta_keywords": "Russia, Government, Intervention, Medicines, Vital, Prices", "meta_description": "Russian government to use interventions in domestic pharma pricing", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 10:20:04", "updated": "2021-05-25 10:28:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russian-government-to-use-interventions-in-domestic-pharma-pricing", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "russia_roubles_rubles_money_big.jpg", "image2id": "russia_roubles_rubles_money_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "All therapy areas", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 10:21:00"}
