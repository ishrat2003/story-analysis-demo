The study demonstrated positive impacts on blood vessel reopening and patient functional recovery with no incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Patients were dosed up to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms; there are currently no approved medical therapies for treatment beyond the 3 to 4.5-hour time window.</p>\n<h2><strong>Financial considerations</strong></h2>\n<p>Biogen will make a one-time $18 million payment as part of the acquisition of TMS-007. TMS is eligible to receive up to an additional $335 million in potential post-acquisition development and commercial payments should TMS-007 achieve certain developmental milestones and sales thresholds. TMS is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the high single digits to sub-teen percentages on annual worldwide net sales. Biogen will be solely responsible for the costs and expenses related to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of TMS-007 following the acquisition.</p>\n<p>Biogen is currently evaluating the next steps for the clinical development of TMS-007, including plans for global studies. Final data results from the Phase IIa study are expected to be communicated at a future scientific forum.</p>\n<p>Approved thrombolytic agents are limited in their use due to their benefit-risk profile in later time windows. According to the American Heart Association, intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most feared complication of the current thrombolytic therapy, tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), which works by dissolving blood clots that block blood flow to the brain. In time windows up to 9 hours after stroke onset, sICH has occurred in patients receiving tPA at rates as high as six percent in controlled studies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are encouraged by these results and made the decision to acquire TMS-007 based on the totality of the safety, imaging and clinical outcome data from the Phase IIa study,&rdquo; said Alfred Sandrock Jr, head of R&amp;D at Biogen. &ldquo;It has been almost 25 years since the last thrombolytic agent was approved for acute ischemic stroke and we believe this novel investigational drug may expand the number of eligible patients who could potentially receive thrombolytic therapy and thus have a higher chance of functional independence after stroke,&rdquo; he opined.</p>", "date": "2021-05-12 15:38:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Biogen, TMS Co, TMS-007, License, Option, Stroke, Ischemic", "meta_description": "Biogen buys rights to investigational \u00e2\u0080\u0098game-changing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stroke drug", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": "Biogen buys rights to investigational \u00e2\u0080\u0098game-changing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stroke drug", "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-12 15:36:39", "updated": "2021-05-12 15:45:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-buys-rights-to-investigational-game-changing-stroke-drug", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biogen-big-1.png", "image2id": "biogen-small-1.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Acute ischemic stroke", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Biogen, TMS", "drug_tag": "TMS-007", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-12 15:38:00"}
