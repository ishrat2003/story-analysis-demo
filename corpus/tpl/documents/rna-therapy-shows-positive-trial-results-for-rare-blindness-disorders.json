{"contentid": 488145, "importid": NaN, "name": "RNA therapy shows positive trial results for rare blindness disorders", "introduction": NaN, "content": "<p>Dutch rare diseases biotech firm ProQR Therapeutics (Nasdaq: PRQR) saw its share rise as much as 11% in early trading today, after it announced encouraging results from a planned analysis of its Phase I/II Stellar trial of QR-421a in adults with Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (nsRP) due to&nbsp;USH2A&nbsp;exon 13 mutations.</p>\n<p>In the trial, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal Phase II/III trials by year end 2021 &ndash; one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.</p>\n<p>Early last year, the US Food and Drug Administration awarded a Rare Pediatric disease designation for QR-421a, designed to address the underlying cause of vision loss related to this type of genetic abnormality.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the Stella trial, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the Phase II/III pivotal trials,&rdquo; said Dr Aniz Girach, chief medical officer of ProQR.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plan to advance pivotal testing</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision. As expected, we saw benefits in both advanced and early-moderate patients in this slow progressing, debilitating eye disease, allowing us to advance this important investigational therapy for all patients with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to USH2A exon 13 mutations. Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal trials, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through clinical development,&rdquo; Dr Girach noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,&rdquo; said Dr Robert Koenekoop, a clinical-scientist from the Montreal Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surger, adding: &ldquo;Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to USH2A exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients&rsquo; biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal trial development.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-24 17:29:00", "meta_title": "RNA therapy shows positive trial results for rare blindness disorders", "meta_keywords": "ProQR Therapeutics, QR-421a, Usher syndrome, Pigmentosa, Retinitis, Phase I/II", "meta_description": "RNA therapy shows positive trial results for rare blindness disorders", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-24 17:27:54", "updated": "2021-03-24 17:35:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rna-therapy-shows-positive-trial-results-for-rare-blindness-disorders", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "proqr_large.png", "image2id": "proqr_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Retinitis pigmentosa", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Ophthalmics, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Netherlands", "company_tag": "ProQR Therapeutics N.V.", "drug_tag": "QR-421a", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-24 17:29:00"}
