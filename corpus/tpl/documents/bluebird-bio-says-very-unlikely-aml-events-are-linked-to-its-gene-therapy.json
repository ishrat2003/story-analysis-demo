VAMP4 has no known association with the development of AML nor with processes such as cellular proliferation or genome stability. Moreover, we see no significant gene misregulation attributable to the insertion event,&rdquo; said Philip Gregory, chief scientific officer, bluebird bio.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In totality, the data from our assessments provide important evidence demonstrating that it is very unlikely our BB305 lentiviral vector played a role in this case and we have shared with the FDA that we believe these results support lifting the clinical holds on our &beta;-thalassemia and sickle cell disease programs,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>As reported by bluebird bio on February 25, 2021, laboratory analyses showed that this patient had significant chromosomal abnormalities and mutations in genes typically associated with the development of AML. Specifically, mutations in the RUNX1 and PTPN11 genes have been detected in the leukemic cells of this patient. Preliminary findings suggested that the BB305 LVV vector was present in the AML blast cells, but there was not sufficient information to determine causality.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional scientific assessments</strong></h2>\n<p>Since then, and with the advice of several independent leading academic experts in lentiviral vector gene therapy, bluebird bio has performed additional scientific assessments to determine where in the genome the LVV insertion occurred, and if this integration was responsible for any change in gene regulation or gene expression nearby.</p>\n<p>Multiple independent analyses have confirmed that vector insertion in the AML cells from this patient took place in the VAMP4 gene, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 4. VAMP4 itself has no known role in the development of AML or with any cellular process related to cancer.</p>\n<p>Based on the available results to date, bluebird bio believes that the case of AML is very unlikely related to the BB305 LVV. Given this, the company has initiated engagement with regulators to begin the process of resuming clinical studies for sickle cell disease and &beta;-thalassemia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-10 17:39:00", "meta_title": "Shares of US biotech bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE) gained 13% pre-market", "meta_keywords": "bluebird bio, LentiGlobin, Zynteglo, Adverse effects, AML, Leukemia, Clinical hold", "meta_description": "Shares of US biotech bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE) gained 13% pre-market today and were still up 8.8% at $32.70 by mid-morning after it announced encouraging anal", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-10 17:37:06", "updated": "2021-03-10 17:50:52", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bluebird-bio-says-very-unlikely-aml-events-are-linked-to-its-gene-therapy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "bluebird_bio_large.jpg", "image2id": "bluebird_bio_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Sickle cell disease", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "bluebird bio", "drug_tag": "LentiGlobin, Zynteglo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-10 17:39:00"}
