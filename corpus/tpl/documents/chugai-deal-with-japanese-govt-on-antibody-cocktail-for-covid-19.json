In December of the same year, <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chugai-in-licenses-antibody-cocktail-for-covid-19-from-roche\">Chugai obtained development righ</a>ts and exclusive commercialization rights in Japan for the antibody cocktail from Roche.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, including the spread of infections of variants, has been persistent, and new treatment options continue to be pursued. The two potent virus-neutralizing antibodies administered together, bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus spike protein, which may neutralize the activity against SARS-CoV-2 and protects against spike variants currently circulating in the human population.</p>\n<h2><strong>Phase I trial in Japan initiated </strong></h2>\n<p>Several overseas clinical trials have been conducted for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. In Japan, a Phase I clinical trial has been initiated in March of this year to examine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in Japanese.</p>\n<p>Chugai says it will continue to collaborate with the Japanese government to ensure appropriate and timely supply of the antibody cocktail upon regulatory approval.</p>\n<p>This matter is not included in the earnings forecast for the fiscal year 2021 announced on February 4, 2021. No changes are expected to Chugai&rsquo;s financial prospects at this time, but we will promptly disclose any events that should be disclosed in the future, the company noted.</p>\n<p>In January this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) said they will purchase up to 1.25 million additional doses of the casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail for use in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to meet the federal government's Operation Warp Speed goals. The agreement has a value of up to $2.625 billion. The treatment has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use and is under review with the European Medicines Agency.</p>", "date": "2021-05-10 12:37:00", "meta_title": "Chugai deal with Japanese govt on antibody cocktail for COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "Chugai, COVID-19, Antibody cocktail,  Casirivimab, Imdevimab, REGN-COV2, Roche,\nGovernment, Deal, Supply", "meta_description": "Chugai deal with Japanese govt on antibody cocktail for COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-10 12:35:57", "updated": "2021-05-10 12:44:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chugai-deal-with-japanese-govt-on-antibody-cocktail-for-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "chugai_kamakura_large.jpg", "image2id": "chugai_kamakura_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On, Government Affairs", "geography_tag": "Japan", "company_tag": "Chugai, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche", "drug_tag": "casirivimab, imdevimab, REGN-COV2", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-10 12:37:00"}
