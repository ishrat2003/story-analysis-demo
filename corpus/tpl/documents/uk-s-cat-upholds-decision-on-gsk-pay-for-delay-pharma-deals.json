GSK had agreed to make payments totalling &pound;50 million to other generic suppliers of paroxetine, including Generics (UK) Limited (GUK) and Alpharma Limited (Alpharma), in settlement of patent litigation.</p>\n<p>In a decision issued in 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that these payments were aimed at delaying the potential entry of these competitors supplying generic medicines into the UK market and were unlawful. The CMA imposed fines totalling &pound;44.99 million on the companies directly involved in the infringements - and, where relevant, on their parent companies or successors to these companies.</p>\n<p>In March 2018, the Tribunal dismissed a number of the companies&rsquo; grounds of appeal against the CMA&rsquo;s decision, and referred the remaining grounds to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling on various questions of EU law. In January 2020, the CJEU issued its ruling, in which it confirmed that this type of &lsquo;pay for delay&rsquo; agreement has the object of restricting competition and may constitute an abuse of a dominant position.</p>\n<p>This latest <a href=\"https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-05/1251-1255_Paroxetine_Judgment_CAT9_100521.pdf\">judgment</a>&nbsp;from the Tribunal unanimously dismissed all of the pharmaceutical companies&rsquo; remaining grounds of appeal in respect of the infringements. The Department of Health and Social Care will now be able to seek follow-on damages in the courts. Taking various factors into account, the Tribunal lowered the CMA&rsquo;s original fines imposed on the companies.</p>", "date": "2021-05-12 16:27:00", "meta_title": "UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CAT upholds decision on GSK pay-for-delay pharma deals", "meta_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline, Paroxetine, Competition, Appeal Tribunal, CMA, Pay-for-delay, Deals", "meta_description": "UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CAT upholds decision on GSK pay-for-delay pharma deals", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-12 16:26:52", "updated": "2021-05-12 16:36:22", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uk-s-cat-upholds-decision-on-gsk-pay-for-delay-pharma-deals", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cma-large.jpg", "image2id": "cma-small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Competition Appeal Tribunal, Reverse payment patent settlement", "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Legal, Patents & Trademarks", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "GlaxoSmithKline", "drug_tag": "paroxetine", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-12 16:27:00"}
