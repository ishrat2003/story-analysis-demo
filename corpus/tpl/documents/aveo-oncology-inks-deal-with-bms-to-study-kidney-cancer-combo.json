AVEO will serve as the study sponsor and will be responsible for costs associated with the trial execution.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With the recent US FDA approval of Fotivda in the relapsed/refractory RCC setting, I look forward to further exploring Fotivda&rsquo;s immunomodulatory effects and differentiated tolerability profile in combination with Opdivo,&rdquo; said Dr Toni Choueiri, director, Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology; Director, Kidney Cancer Center; Jerome and Nancy Kohlberg Chair and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This combination was first explored in the Phase I/II TiNivo study, where it demonstrated favorable tolerability and prolonged PFS using the combination of Fotivda and Opdivo in both treatment na&iuml;ve and previously-treated patients with advanced RCC. The TiNivo-2 Phase III study is expected to further our understanding of the activity and tolerability of this combination following prior immunotherapy,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The advanced RCC treatment landscape has seen significant benefit from the introduction of immunotherapy-VEGF TKI combinations in earlier-line treatment, and we believe that this benefit could extend to the relapsed/refractory setting with an effective, well-tolerated combination,&rdquo; said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive of AVEO.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-12 14:49:00", "meta_title": "AVEO Oncology inks deal with BMS to study kidney cancer combo", "meta_keywords": "AVEO Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb, Fotivda, Opdivo, Collaboration, Cancer, Kidney, Carcinoma, Renal cell, Phase III", "meta_description": "AVEO Oncology inks deal with BMS to study kidney cancer combo", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-12 14:48:12", "updated": "2021-03-12 14:58:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/aveo-oncology-inks-deal-with-bms-to-study-kidney-cancer-combo", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "aveo_oncology_large.jpg", "image2id": "aveo_oncology_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AVEO Oncology, Bristol-Myers Squibb", "drug_tag": "Fotivda, Opdivo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-12 14:49:00"}
