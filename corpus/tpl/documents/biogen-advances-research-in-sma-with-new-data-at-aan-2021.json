We continue to be driven by the pursuit of better outcomes for patients, including exploring the potential of a higher dose of Spinraza in the DEVOTE study, in addition to initiating the RESPOND study,&rdquo; said Dr Alfred Sandrock Jr, head of R&amp;D at Biogen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are also evaluating the use of biomarkers and digital tools to supplement traditional clinical assessments for SMA and enhance disease monitoring. Through these collective research efforts, we aim to provide valuable data that may help guide future treatment approaches and decisions for people with SMA,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Exploring opportunities to optimize treatment in SMA</strong></p>\n<p>Building on the proven efficacy and well-established safety of Spinraza in a broad range of patients with SMA, the Phase II/III DEVOTE study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential for even greater efficacy of Spinraza when administered at a higher dose than currently approved. The three-part study includes an open-label safety evaluation cohort (Part A), a pivotal, double-blind, active control randomized treatment cohort (Part B) and an open-label cohort (Part C) transitioning from the approved 12-milligram (mg) dose of Spinraza to the higher dose.</p>\n<p>Spinraza, which generated sales of $2.05 billion last year, is approved to treat infants, children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and is available in more than 50 countries. As a foundation of care in SMA, more than 11,000 individuals have been treated with Spinraza worldwide, Biogen noted.</p>\n<p><strong>SMA Data Presentations Featured at AAN:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Escalating Dose and Randomized, Controlled Study of Nusinersen in Participants With Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA); Study Design and Part A Data for the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE (232SM203) Study to Explore High-Dose Nusinersen &ndash; P6.080</li>\n<li>Baseline Plasma Phosphorylated Neurofilament Heavy Chain (pNF-H) Level Is Associated With Future Motor Function in Nusinersen-treated Individuals With Later-onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) &ndash; S13.005 &ndash; Monday, April 19, 2:40 p.m. ET</li>\n<li>Konectom Smartphone-Based Digital Outcome Assessments for Adults Living With Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA): A Conceptual Framework &ndash; P8.010</li>\n</ul>", "date": "2021-04-19 13:00:00", "meta_title": "Biogen advances research in SMA, with new data at AAN 2021", "meta_keywords": "Biogen, Spinraza, SMA.
