Ragwitek was first launched for adult use in the USA and Canada in 2014 and was approved in nine European countries and Russia in late 2017. In addition, ALK recently received European and Canadian regulatory approval for pediatric use of the ragweed tablet.</p>\n<p>ALK&rsquo;s executive vice president of R&amp;D, Henrik Jacobi, says: &ldquo;Ragweed is a major cause of allergy in North America. This expanded approval means there can now be an earlier intervention to treat what can be a distressing condition. It also advances ALK&rsquo;s commitment to address unmet medical need by expanding the coverage of its tablet portfolio to cover patients of all relevant ages.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The application for pediatric use drew upon clinical data from a Phase III safety and efficacy trial involving 1,022 patients aged five through 17 years with a history of ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis. The randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, comparative trial met its primary endpoint, with a major reduction in the average total combined score (TCS) during the peak ragweed season of 38%. Moreover, efficacy in children was consistent with that seen for its sister product, Grazax (Grastek in the USA) for grass pollen allergies.</p>\n<p>Since Ragwitek is already on the market in the USA for patients 18 through 65 years of age, the product becomes available for pediatric use with immediate effect.</p>", "date": "2021-04-19 11:50:00", "meta_title": "ALK gains US pediatric approval for its ragweed SLIT-tablet", "meta_keywords": "ALK Abello, Ragwitek, Ragweed, SLIT-tablet, Approval, Pediatric, FDA, Allergy", "meta_description": "ALK gains US pediatric approval for its ragweed SLIT-tablet", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-19 11:49:24", "updated": "2021-04-19 12:01:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/alk-gains-us-pediatric-approval-for-its-ragweed-slit-tablet", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "alk-abello-big-1.jpg", "image2id": "alk-logo-small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Immunologicals", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Denmark, USA", "company_tag": "ALK Abello", "drug_tag": "Ragwitek", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-19 11:50:00"}
