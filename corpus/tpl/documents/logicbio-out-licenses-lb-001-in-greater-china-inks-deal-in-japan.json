The agreement also includes options payments, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $581 million and up to double-digit royalties on net sales.</p>\n<p>\"We look forward to advancing our rare disease program with LogicBio's next generation, best-in-class capsid and gene editing technologies as we build our gene therapy capability and develop new rare disease treatments in&nbsp;Greater China&nbsp;and worldwide,\" said&nbsp;James Xue, founder, chairman and chief executive of CANbridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \"Partnering with LogicBio is a vital part of our strategy to build a world class rare disease program.\"</p>\n<h2><strong>Also inks research collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo</strong></h2>\n<p>Also today, LogicBio Therapeutics announced a research collaboration and exclusive option agreement with Japan&rsquo;s Daiichi Sankyo (TYO: 4568) for a gene editing program based on LogicBio&rsquo;s proprietary GeneRide platform.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, the companies will collaborate on the development of treatments for two undisclosed indications leveraging GeneRide. The agreement also grants Daiichi Sankyo an option to negotiate and acquire worldwide licenses for LogicBio's development programs in these two indications. Financial terms of the collaboration are not disclosed.</p>\n<p>The GeneRide platform harnesses a cell's natural DNA repair process, leading to durable therapeutic protein expression levels. GeneRide supports the development of a new generation of genetic medicines able to insert a DNA segment into the human genome while potentially avoiding certain risks associated with other gene editing methods (eg, CRISPR). The therapy uses a viral vector to deliver the therapeutic gene, known as a transgene, to the nuclei of a patient's cells via one-time infusion.</p>", "date": "2021-04-27 16:51:00", "meta_title": "LogicBio out-licenses LB-001 in Greater China; inks deal in Japan", "meta_keywords": "LogicBio Therapeutics, LB-001, CANbridge Pharma, License, Daiichi Sankyo, GeneRide platform", "meta_description": "LogicBio out-licenses LB-001 in Greater China; inks deal in Japan", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-27 16:49:29", "updated": "2021-04-27 16:58:16", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/logicbio-out-licenses-lb-001-in-greater-china-inks-deal-in-japan", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "handshake.jpg", "image2id": "handshake-small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "China, Japan, USA", "company_tag": "CANbridge Pharmaceutical, Daiichi Sankyo, LogicBio Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "LB-001", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-27 16:51:00"}
