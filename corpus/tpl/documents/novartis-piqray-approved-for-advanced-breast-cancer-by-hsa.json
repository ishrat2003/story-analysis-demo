Today, we are pleased to be able to offer patients in Singapore with Piqray, an important new therapy for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients whose tumours have a PIK3CA mutation.\"</p>\n<p>Piqray was approved for the same breast cancer indication in the USA in 2019 and in Europe the following year. For full-year 2020, it generated global sales of $320 million, a rise of 176% on the prior year. Baader Helvea&rsquo;s Bruno Bulic previously gave the drug an 80% chance of peak sales reaching $1.9 billion per year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>HSA approval is based on results of the Phase III trial, SOLAR-1, that showed Piqray plus fulvestrant nearly doubled median progression-free survival (PFS) compared to fulvestrant alone in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with a PIK3CA mutation (median PFS 11.0 months versus 5.7 months; Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85; p&lt;0.001). Piqray provided consistent PFS results across pre-specified subgroups, including among patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.</p>\n<p>Piqray is the first drug of its kind approved for treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with hormone receptor positive, HER2- negative, advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation in Singapore, the European Union, and the USA.</p>", "date": "2021-03-01 11:58:00", "meta_title": "Novartis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Piqray approved for advanced breast cancer by HSA", "meta_keywords": "Novartis, Piqray, Breast cancer, Approval, HSA, Singapore", "meta_description": "Novartis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Piqray approved for advanced breast cancer by HSA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-01 11:57:20", "updated": "2021-03-01 12:06:41", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-piqray-approved-for-advanced-breast-cancer-by-hsa", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novartis_sign_large.jpg", "image2id": "novartis_sign_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Advanced breast cancer", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Singapore, Switzerland", "company_tag": "Novartis", "drug_tag": "Piqray", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-01 11:58:00"}
