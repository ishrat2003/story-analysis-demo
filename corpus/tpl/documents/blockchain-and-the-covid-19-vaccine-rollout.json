More than 20 million people have now received their first COVID-19 vaccination in the UK and more than 800,000 have received their second dose. According to a UK government press release, the vaccines are now being administered at 267 hospitals, 1,034 local vaccination sites, 90 vaccination centers and 194 community pharmacies<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sheer scale of what is being delivered is completely unprecedented, and with it comes an even greater need to ensure that the rapid rollout is accurately monitored, and effectively and safely delivered.</p>\n<p>The rollout of any new drug or vaccine will always have its complexities because of the number of intermediaries involved; the COVID-19 vaccines have added complications due to the fact that there are several different vaccines with different storage requirements. Some must be permanently stored at exact temperatures in order to be effective and this temperature must then be maintained from the time of manufacture, through the distribution centers, during transit, as well as in the hospitals and vaccination centers.</p>\n<p>A further complication is that the vaccines are not currently interchangeable, so a patient&rsquo;s subsequent dose must be the same as their first. This requires additional monitoring and coordination from suppliers and medical professionals.</p>\n<p>The sheer scale and speed required by the COVID-19 vaccine rollout means that a well-functioning supply chain is essential, as well as careful monitoring to ensure the process is safe, reliable, traceable and that errors are minimized.</p>\n<h2>How can blockchain help?</h2>\n<p>Coupled with the use of internet of things (IoT) technology (eg, temperature sensors), blockchain could be used to monitor important information about the transport and storage of vaccine batches. For the COVID-19 vaccines in particular, it is essential to monitor the temperature as well as length of time in storage, because the different vaccines have different storage requirements. This means accurate monitoring of the different batches of the different drugs is all the more important.</p>\n<p>This monitoring could be done through IoT sensors which are affixed to the vaccine storage and transportation containers. These sensors would collect, store, and transmit information on temperature (as well as other useful data), storing it on the blockchain. Other authorized parties in the vaccine delivery chain, including hospitals, distributors and regulators could then immediately view this information on the blockchain, allowing them to check that the vaccines were transported and stored correctly and are therefore safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Blockchain could also assist with quick detection and identification of problematic products (eg, faulty, incorrectly stored or counterfeit products) and with their subsequent recall from the supply chain. If an issue is detected, the user could look at all previous data entries, touchpoints, locations and timestamps to trace back to find the origin, specific manufacturer and even the specific batch that it came from.</p>\n<p>There are further safety mechanisms built in to the blockchain, as any attempts to amend the data in the chain would be immediately visible to all authorized participants and would be rejected. This not only improves authenticity, but also enables ways of verifying that any entities<br />handling the product have complied with regulatory requirements.</p>\n<h2>Implementation in NHS hospitals</h2>\n<p>It is exciting that we are already starting to see a move towards the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology<sub>2</sub> within the UK National Health Service (NHS), as two hospitals (in Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon) have started using distributed ledger technology to monitor the storage and supply of temperature-sensitive COVID-19 vaccines. There are two companies involved: digital asset tracking and monitoring provider, Everyware (which already works with the NHS on monitoring other vaccines and treatments including chemotherapy drugs, blood and plasma), and Texas-based distributed ledger provider, Hedera Hashgraph (which is owned and governed by companies such as IBM, Boeing and Google). Everyware provides the temperature-sensitive monitoring sensors and the information is logged on Hedera&rsquo;s platform.</p>\n<p>A normal database can be tampered with, and individuals may be able to edit or remove important information. Hedera&rsquo;s process works by using Everyware&rsquo;s sensors to constantly monitor the temperature of the refrigeration units. The information collected from those sensors is then logged to the decentralised Hedera network. The Hedera network &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; act as the unbiased neutral party to arrange and timestamp the data from the sensors. This makes the whole process more secure, trustworthy and tamper-proof, as it means the database exists across several locations and several parties, and is therefore not reliant on one single centralized authority (as is the case with &lsquo;normal&rsquo; databases, which essentially have one single point of potential failure). This information is then immediately available to any parties who have been given access to it. Distributed ledger technology therefore provides a tamper-proof record-keeping system where integrity and trustworthiness of the data is maintained and results are recorded, validated and shared across the supply chain in a cost-effective, secure and efficient manner.</p>\n<p>Although it cannot eliminate risks completely, blockchain (and distributed ledger technology more generally) can help to reduce the risks and issues associated with the use of manual systems.</p>\n<p>Due to its immutability, transparency and traceability, it can offer efficient and accurate end-to-end tracking and monitoring of the vaccine supply chain and can provide a verifiable and auditable account of information. As the distribution of the vaccines by the NHS continues, a wider rollout of the technology is planned and it is hoped that the technology will be used to improve record-keeping and data-sharing across the entire vaccine supply chain. Other jurisdictions are likely to follow suit, making blockchain technology an important part of the COVID-19 recovery process.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008b1 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-vaccine-uptake-plan-published</p>\n<p>2&nbsp;Distributed ledgers are effectively decentralized databases, which eliminate the need for a central authority to process, validate or authenticate transactions or data exchanges.
