This has been chiefly led by the seismic shifts in disease patterns and population trends, the increase in universal healthcare coverage plans as well as the rise of scientific breakthroughs in healthcare.</p>\n<p>However, the landscape has also been defined by the ongoing attempts by stakeholders to overcome persistent gaps within the healthcare access ecosystem &ndash; the growth of which has not kept pace with the region&rsquo;s broader socio-economic development. These realities were put under the microscope during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especially in terms of access.</p>\n<p>The region&rsquo;s stakeholders must work together to ensure there are efforts that complement health systems to properly care for and manage the needs of today&rsquo;s population. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s important to consider the following five key trends influencing the current state of healthcare access in Southeast Asia, and what can be done to improve its long-term sustainability.</p>\n<h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Access is being re-defined &ndash; from a short-term strategy to a long-term solution</strong></h2>\n<p>Traditionally, treatment access solutions for patients paying out-of-pocket for treatment were considered a short-term strategy until a treatment was reimbursed in the country. For years, pharmaceutical companies focused mainly on reimbursement, hoping to obtain reimbursement for specialty, high-cost treatments in the same way as primary care medications.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has only exacerbated these reimbursement challenges. It has also increased the number of people who have lost their jobs and are no longer covered or able to afford private insurance. This makes sustainable access solutions more important than ever, especially given that many people in Southeast Asia are particularly vulnerable when it comes to healthcare financing, with over 65 million people being pushed into poverty because of health expenditure.</p>\n<p>As government priorities shifted and budget cuts remained, companies were already looking to alternative access solutions such as patient assistance programs (PAPs) or patient support programs (PSPs) as long-term solutions. This prompted a series of shifts in how access is defined and prioritized, and countries across Southeast Asia &ndash; especially its middle-income and emerging markets &ndash; have been pushing through slews of health-financing reforms to help manage costs of more widespread healthcare delivery.</p>\n<p>Our organization is doing its part to improve access through cost-sharing initiatives that help split costs across multiple parties over a period of time. This includes working with pharmaceutical companies to assess how much help patients need to afford their full treatment course &ndash; using a unique confidential assessment tool called the Patient Financial Ability Tool (PFET) &ndash; which is being used in all the Asian countries we are present in.</p>\n<p>Such alternative access programs can help supplement long-term efforts by government and healthcare stakeholders. However, accessibility is not purely defined by affordability.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Access no longer stops at affordability</strong></h2>\n<p>Access is a multi-dimensional issue, so it must be addressed with multi-dimensional solutions. To maximize treatment outcomes, access solutions have evolved from focusing solely on treatment affordability to offering services to support patients throughout their treatment journey &ndash; from diagnosis to treatment adherence.</p>\n<p>Currently, treatment adherence remains a problem across Southeast Asia. This is reflected in the persistent adherence problems for certain chronic diseases in Singapore, while studies have placed non-adherence rates in Malaysia at up to 56%, with little improvement over the years. Health outcomes are multifactorial &ndash; other than genetics and medical care, social circumstances can affect 15-40%, environmental and physical influences 5%-20%, and behavior 30%-50%.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, there are growing rates of chronic diseases requiring life-long treatment, and so adherence solutions are needed now more than ever. But each patient journey is unique and necessitates the availability of customized support programs that can comprehensively meet the patient&rsquo;s underserved needs and challenges in more personalized ways &ndash; not via &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approaches.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. There is a growing focus on reaching patients outside the hospital</strong></h2>\n<p>Hospitals and health facilities have long been the central pillar of health systems. But the world has radically changed while the healthcare sector has remained mostly stagnant &ndash; creating a significant void outside health facilities. This is because most healthcare systems do not have the infrastructure, network and/or capacity to communicate with patients when they leave the hospital.</p>\n<p>The result is poor treatment adherence and less than optimal medical outcomes. However, the private sector, including pharmaceutical companies, is well-positioned to expedite this much-needed change, as they can collaborate with the wider healthcare ecosystem to offer products or services outside of hospitals or clinics that are facing increasing capacity burdens.</p>\n<p>In Southeast Asia, populations are growing and healthcare demands are rising, especially with the pandemic still ongoing, while the healthcare system is overburdened. For instance, the heavily subsidised public sector in Malaysia caters to about 65% of the population but is served by just 45% of all registered doctors, with even fewer specialists (25%-30%). To overcome the patient support gap outside of healthcare facilities, more public and private healthcare access stakeholders are exploring the use of digital tools, especially those that can complement existing services and reducing the reliance on in-hospital services.</p>\n<p>Overall, digital tools can save considerable time and costs, enabling health facilities to improve their capacity and better support patients. By making them more efficient, cost-savings can eventually improve patient access at scale, leading to the more holistic maximization of health outcomes.</p>\n<p>That said, while digitalization can streamline operations and optimize resources, they remain as enablers; they wouldn&rsquo;t work as efficiently &ndash; or as effectively &ndash; if they were a standalone solution. Without the human element, any self-reported information added to the digital platform by the patient would begin and end with them. By proactively triggering a response based on data entered, the human factor behind a digital platform plays a significant role in maximising health benefits for patients.</p>\n<p>Our efforts &ndash; be they digital or physical &ndash; should reach patients irrespective of where they are. Hence, equal emphasis should be placed on physical channels that support providing the continuum of care with patients outside of healthcare institutions, and help relieve the capacity burdens faced by hospitals, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic.</p>\n<h2>4. Companies are exploring new ways to engage with governments on access</h2>\n<p>While the role of the private sector in helping to improve access is more vital than ever, long-term sustainability cannot be achieved without government involvement. While government engagement is key for a sustainable access strategy, companies still find it challenging to engage with public sector agencies on treatment access beyond traditional reimbursement discussions.</p>\n<p>To bridge this gap, companies and other access stakeholders must evolve their ways to not only engage, but also work closely with governments on the value of collaborative solutions. This should focus on looking beyond conventional approaches to minimizing access burden and move the needle forward on access.</p>\n<p>For instance, in Malaysia, there are cost-sharing programs that allow for co-funding between the government and pharmaceutical companies. The government&rsquo;s willingness to innovate and explore different ways of improving access paves the way for successful solutions.</p>\n<p>We have seen first-hand the potential of similar partnerships within the ecosystem in different parts of the world. It also rings true for stakeholders in the private sector, such as insurance companies, whose role has evolved and can make a difference in access initiatives. The more stakeholders involved in enabling healthcare access, the better.</p>\n<h2>5. More relevant data is needed to inform access decision-making</h2>\n<p>Even before the pandemic, the world was in the thick of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Technology is now facilitating the evolution of societies, industries and governments, and so the healthcare sector must keep up with the rapidly changing environment. One way the healthcare ecosystem can do this is by leveraging more data to improve decision-making processes.</p>\n<p>This is because, as broader access becomes more integral across multiple therapeutic areas, the need for robust data to inform access decisions has increased. The data needed to inform access decisions can be different from data typically collected via clinical trials or post-marketing studies, and hence they can provide breakthrough insights on areas like disease evolution, treatment, patients&rsquo; perceptions, outcomes and cost. For this reason, there&rsquo;s a need to capture access-related real-world insights to gauge the impact of access interventions and their overall effectiveness. At Axios International, we&rsquo;ve been using this data to understand how to ensure optimum treatment access, affordability, and adherence amongst patients and improve how PSPs should be designed to reach patient benefits.</p>\n<h2>Access is no longer 'a good to have'</h2>\n<p>Today, access to healthcare solutions is being increasingly integrated with the business models of private sector stakeholders, namely pharmaceutical companies. The key difference now as compared to previous efforts is that there is now a more concerted effort to develop sustainable access models, rather than one-off short-term solutions. Nevertheless, true sustainability can only happen via a multi-sectoral, multi-dimensional response.</p>\n<p>In fast-developing regions such as Southeast Asia, current healthcare systems are no longer able to quickly adapt to the ever-evolving needs of patients living in our rapidly changing world. Unless the widening access gaps are addressed, healthcare for patients will gradually become less effective, in addition to there being more sub-optimal outcomes and &ndash; above all &ndash; the inability to respond to future public health challenges.</p>\n<p>Hence, the onus is now on Southeast Asia&rsquo;s companies, access specialists and civil society groups to instil this change. Each has a key part to play in collaborating with the government to close access gaps, but they must work in concert with each other if they want to ensure that patients will have access to quality care and treatment, wherever they are.</p>", "date": "2021-04-28 16:57:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "access, healthcare, treatment, patients, stakeholders, solutions, Southeast, companies, long-term, health, Asia, patient, sector, improve, sustainability", "meta_description": "A Special Report on the top five trends redefining the way healthcare stakeholders look at long-term healthcare access sustainability in the region from Roshel ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-28 16:05:07", "updated": "2021-04-30 14:38:12", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-is-healthcare-access-in-southeast-asia-shaping-up-in-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "southeast-asia_big.jpg", "image2id": "southeast_asia_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Special report", "geography_tag": "Southeast Asia", "company_tag": "Axios International", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-28 16:57:00"}
