The news saw Ipsen&rsquo;s shares rise 4.6% to 73.20 euros by early afternoon, having hit a hit of 75.05 euros in early trading.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s EC approval for the use of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo provides an important new first-line treatment option for patients living with advanced renal cell carcinoma,&rdquo; said Howard Mayer, executive vice president and head of R&amp;D at Ipsen, adding: &ldquo;At Ipsen, we&rsquo;re proud that this, now approved, treatment option not only addresses key efficacy benefits, but also the need to maintain quality of life for patients. We look forward to collaborating with a broad range of European stakeholders to bring this unique combination to eligible patients living with advanced renal cell carcinoma.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The EC approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial, presented during a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 and <a href=\"http://email.msgsnd.com/c/eJwdjsFqwzAQRL_GPgrtaiVZBx3StD4U2n9YS6s4IY6DLPDvVxSGYQYG3uTovS483iNqBG0MaEdIqEBdaf7U5ur8xTiaP-aB9HbcjldWad_GNQqbxaMIT35ygHnKZRIXSraLQbFufMa1tfcxmMuAc9d5nuolj03t9dZr3u_dQSvQ1vX0-_X9s3O_4cKEY40L1y7u2LbKe-W68VNak_rPb7EkCguiOI8JDFDx2lkPgUPCIMB9AqUwJy6E1hH5xUoAzZyzJTSU_B94nkjG\">published</a> in the&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on March 3, 2021. In the trial, Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo demonstrated significant improvements across all efficacy endpoints. In patients receiving the combination, median progression-free survival (PFS), the trial&rsquo;s primary endpoint, was doubled compared to those receiving sunitinib alone: 16.6 months versus 8.3 months respectively (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41&ndash;0.64; p&lt;0.0001).</p>\n<p>Overall survival (OS) also demonstrated statistically-significant improvements, reducing the risk of death by 40% versus sunitinib (HR: 0.60 [98.89% CI: 0.40-0.89]; p=0.001; median OS not reached in either arm). In addition, Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo demonstrated a superior objective response rate (ORR), with twice as many patients responding compared to sunitinib (55.7% vs 27.1%; p&lt;0.0001) and 8.0% vs 4.6% achieved a complete response respectively.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Key efficacy results were consistent across the pre-specified International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk and PD-L1 subgroups. The combination was well tolerated and reflected the known safety profiles of the immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor components in first-line aRCC.</p>\n<p>Cabometyx, to which Ipsen acquired right in 2016 from USA-based Exelixis (Nasdaq: EXEL), is also approved in the European Union as a monotherapy for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior VEGF-targeted therapy, for previously untreated intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC, and for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults who have been previously treated with sorafenib. The EC approval in combination with Opdivo follows the US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s approval of the combination regimen for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC in January 2021.</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 14:15:00", "meta_title": "EC approves Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo", "meta_keywords": "Cabometyx, Opdivo, Combination, Ipsen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Approval, Carcinoma, Renal, European Commission", "meta_description": "EC approves Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 14:14:05", "updated": "2021-03-31 14:22:48", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ec-approves-cabometyx-in-combination-with-opdivo", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ipsen-logo-big.jpg", "image2id": "ipsen-logo-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, France, USA", "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb, Ipsen", "drug_tag": "Cabometyx, Opdivo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 14:15:00"}
