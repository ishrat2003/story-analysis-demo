{"contentid": 488040, "importid": NaN, "name": "Rivals Merck and Gilead partner on HIV treatment combo", "introduction": "Gilead Sciences and pharma giant Merck & Cohave entered into an agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV that combine Gilead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, and Merck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir.", "content": "<p>US biotech Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) and pharma giant Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) have entered into an agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV that combine Gilead&rsquo;s investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, and Merck&rsquo;s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir into a two-drug regimen with the potential to provide new, meaningful treatment options for people living with HIV.</p>\n<p>The first clinical studies of the oral combination are expected to begin in the second half of 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will work as partners, sharing operational responsibilities, as well as development, commercialization and marketing costs, and any future revenues.</p>\n<p>Merck and Gilead seek to build on their legacies of transforming HIV care by focusing on long-acting therapies, which may represent a meaningful innovation in HIV drug development. While daily, single tablet regimens are available for people living with HIV, options that would allow for less frequent, oral dosing or infrequent injections rather than daily dosing have the potential to address preference considerations, as well as issues associated with adherence and privacy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Long-acting therapies may provide additional options</strong></h2>\n<p>As the field of HIV treatment evolves, long-acting therapies may provide additional options for people living with HIV and their physicians that will help continue to put the needs of individuals at the center of their own care.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At Merck, we are resolute in our commitment to advancing the care of people living with HIV as part of our mission to save and improve lives,&rdquo; said Kenneth Frazier, chairman and chief executive of Merck, adding: &ldquo;This collaboration with Gilead brings together two companies dedicated to the fight against HIV to develop potential new long-acting treatment options, and is an important step forward in our strategy to harness the full potential of islatravir for the treatment of HIV.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Through this agreement with Merck, Gilead is reinforcing its long-term role in transforming HIV care,&rdquo; said Daniel O&rsquo;Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences. &ldquo;Our work in HIV over the past decades has been shaped by listening to people living with HIV and the physicians who treat them. Now we are taking the same approach with long-acting therapies, combining the most advanced science from both companies to accelerate progress,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>Lenacapavir and islatravir, alone and in combination, are investigational and not approved anywhere globally. Their safety and efficacy have not yet been established.</p>", "date": "2021-03-15 12:46:00", "meta_title": "Merck and Gilead partner on HIV treatment combo", "meta_keywords": "Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co, Lenacapavir, Islatravir, Agreement, Co-development, HIV, Combination", "meta_description": "Merck and Gilead partner on HIV treatment combo", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-15 12:45:02", "updated": "2021-03-15 18:07:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-and-gilead-partner-on-hiv-treatment-combo", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "hiv_aids_big.jpg", "image2id": "hiv_aids_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "HIV", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-virals", "topic_tag": NaN, "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co", "drug_tag": "islatravir, lenacapavir", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-15 12:46:00"}
