Shares of PTC were up 3.3% at $60.36 by late morning.</p>\n<p>The availability of several disease-modifying therapies for SMA has made regenerative interventions the next frontier in drug discovery and development. The SMA Foundation&ndash;PTC partnership will provide funding, managed by the SMA Foundation, to academic institutions and other collaborators to advance foundational research in the area of regenerative medicine.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Addressing the therapeutic gap in neuromuscular disorders</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;In neuromuscular disease, correcting the underlying cause is just the first step. Patients need therapies to help restore lost function. We are excited to expand our partnership with PTC Therapeutics to empower researchers to address this therapeutic gap in neuromuscular disorders with an emphasis on SMA,&rdquo; said Loren Eng, president, The SMA Foundation, adding: &ldquo;Our longstanding partnership with PTC lets us harness our research capabilities and PTC&rsquo;s drug discovery and development expertise and access to core technology platforms, all of which supported the recent approval of Evrysdi (risdiplam) in SMA. We look forward to our initial funding of new projects under the collaboration with PTC.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have had an extremely productive partnership with the SMA Foundation for well over a decade and are excited to continue this collaboration to investigate regenerative medicine to find new therapies for patients with SMA and other neuromuscular disorders,&rdquo; said Stuart Peltz, chief executive of PTC Therapeutics. &ldquo;The SMA Foundation has been the leader in supporting SMA research and we look forward to doing the critical work to accelerate the next generation of therapeutics for these patients,&rdquo; he noted.</p>", "date": "2021-03-09 15:53:00", "meta_title": "PTC Therapeutics and SMA Foundation to collaborate on regenerative med", "meta_keywords": "PTC Therapeutics, SMA Foundation, Collaboration,  Regenerative medicine, Funding, Neuromuscular disorders", "meta_description": "PTC Therapeutics and SMA Foundation to collaborate on regenerative medicine", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 15:51:54", "updated": "2021-03-09 16:04:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ptc-therapeutics-and-sma-foundation-to-collaborate-on-regenerative-medicine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ptc-therapeutics-big.jpg", "image2id": "ptc-therapeutics-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases, Regenerative Medicine", "topic_tag": "Deals, Financial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "PTC Therapeutics, SMA Foundation", "drug_tag": "Evrysdi", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-09 15:53:00"}
