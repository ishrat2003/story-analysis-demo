But criticisms have emerged as well, including concerns that the FDA has lacked consistency in its application of evidentiary standards, and that the incentives and procedures in place today have proven inadequate to get high quality confirmatory trials completed in a reasonable time frame.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From various points on the spectrum, concerns are also raised that patients may not be getting fair access to these drugs, while some question whether the high prices for most of the drugs approved through this pathway are merited given the level of uncertainty about their effectiveness at launch.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So today, after nearly three decades of experience, it is a good time to take stock of where the AAP is, and what might be done to strengthen it. No policy reform options come without potential downsides, and the goal of our white paper is to outline the potential benefits and risks of major policy options.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Reforms considered by the paper include strengthening the selection of surrogate endpoints, developing standardized AAP templates to increase consistency and evidence standards, and requiring greater use of randomized controlled trials.</p>\n<p>Other changes weighed up are creating a new alert on the label of AAP therapies, tying economic incentives to the completion of confirmatory trials, changing the conditions for continued marketing approval if confirmatory evidence is not provided by a pre-determined date and offering a safety-only approval, without requirement of public or private insurance coverage, for treatments that have demonstrated safety but not an ability to improve patients&rsquo; lives.</p>\n<p>Finally, consideration is given to increasing mandatory federal rebate levels until time of full approval, pricing at marginal cost until confirmatory evidence reviewed, or allowing full market pricing at launch that reverts to marginal cost pricing if confirmatory trials are not completed in a reasonable timeframe, and requiring payment for AAP therapies be tied to outcomes-based contracts.</p>", "date": "2021-04-26 18:05:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "ICER, approval, paper, options, pricing, strengthening, potential, time, Drug, white, economic, confirmatory, patients, pathway, ponders, trials, FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s", "meta_description": "US non-profit the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), in collaboration with researchers from the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Can", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-26 18:01:21", "updated": "2021-04-26 21:18:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-ponders-options-for-strengthening-fda-s-aap", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "icer_big.jpg", "image2id": "icer_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "ICER", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-26 18:05:00"}
