Chief executive Siggi Olafsson said: &ldquo;2021 is off to a good start with performance in line with our expectations. Our broad portfolio of essential medicines, strong commercial capabilities and over 30 new product launches across our markets have supported this progress. We expect to build on this momentum and are pleased to have recently resumed the launch of our high-quality, substitutable generic version of Advair Diskus.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He said the firm&rsquo;s global Injectables business is performing well.&nbsp; In the USA, new product launches and demand for our broader portfolio are partially offsetting reduced demand for COVID-19 related products and the gradual return of elective surgeries.</p>\n<p>The Generics business is having a good start to the year, reflecting the benefits of Hikma&rsquo;s broad portfolio. It has also seen continued demand for certain COVID-19 related products, and a good performance from recent launches, which is more than offsetting increased competition on certain products, in line with its expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We now expect our full year Generics revenue to be towards the top end of our guidance range of $770 million to $810 million and core operating margin to be around 20%,&rdquo; Mr Olafsson noted.</p>", "date": "2021-04-30 12:22:00", "meta_title": "US FDA approval for Hikma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kloxxado", "meta_keywords": "Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Kloxxado, Naloxone, Opioid, Overdose, FDA, Approval, Trading, Udate", "meta_description": "US FDA approval for Hikma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kloxxado", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-30 12:21:02", "updated": "2021-04-30 12:30:37", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-fda-approval-for-hikma-s-kloxxado", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "hikma-big.jpg", "image2id": "hikma-company.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Financial, Focus On, Management, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Hikma Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Kloxxado, Naloxone", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-30 12:22:00"}
