A final decision on the approval by the European Commission is usually issues in about two-three months.</p>\n<p>The Committee recommended granting a marketing authorization for <strong>Copiktra</strong> (duvelisib), from US biotech Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM), for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). In August last year, Verastem sold worldwide rights to Copiktra, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma, to Secura Bio, an integrated biopharmaceutical company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for <strong>Ponvory</strong> (ponesimod), from Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) unit Janssen, for the treatment of active relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. If approved, ponesimod will be the first therapy by Janssen for patients living with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. The US FDA approved ponesimod for use in adults with relapsing forms of MS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in March 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Drovelis</strong> from Hungary&rsquo;s Gedeon Richter (RICHT: HB), and its duplicate <strong>Lydisilka</strong>, from Estetra, both containing the active substances estetrol and drospirenone, received positive opinions from the Committee for use as oral contraceptives.</p>\n<p>The CHMP recommended granting a marketing authorization for the Diurnal Group (AIM: DNL) hybrid medicine <strong>Efmody</strong> (hydrocortisone) for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in patients aged 12 years and over. Hybrid applications rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials of an already authorised reference product and in part on new data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Withdrawal of application</strong></h2>\n<p>An application to extend the use of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) <strong>Brilique</strong> (ticagrelor) with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) to prevent problems caused by blood clots in adults with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes was withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>COVID-19: Outcome of review on the use of regdanvimab</strong></h2>\n<p>The CHMP gave a recommendation to define conditions of use South Korean firm Celltrion&rsquo;s (Kosdaq: 068270) monoclonal antibody regdanvimab (also known as CT-P59). This medicine is currently not authorized in the European Union, but the recommendation provides a harmonized scientific opinion at EU level to support national decision making on the possible use of this antibody to treat confirmed COVID-19 in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen therapy and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;ema_building-credit_rob_acket</p>", "date": "2021-03-27 14:23:00", "meta_title": "March EMA/CHMP meeting sees five positive novel drugs recommended", "meta_keywords": "EMA, CHMP, Recommendations, Verastem, Copiktra, Janssen, Ponvory, Gedeon Richter, Drovelis, Diurnal, Efmody, AstraZeneca, Brilique, Celltrion, Regdanvimab", "meta_description": "March EMA/CHMP meeting sees five positive novel drugs recommended", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-27 14:22:07", "updated": "2021-03-27 14:41:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/march-ema-chmp-meeting-sees-five-positive-novel-drugs-recommended", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket.jpg", "image2id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, Immuno-oncology, Infectious diseases, Musculoskeletal, Oncology, Rare diseases, Reproductive", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, CellTrion, Diurnal Group, Gedeon Richter, Janssen, Verastem", "drug_tag": "Brilique, Copiktra, Drovelis, Efmody, Ponvory, regdanvimab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-27 14:23:00"}
