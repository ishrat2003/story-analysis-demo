For a lot of people, aging is defined as a sum of all these different problems.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough science</h2>\n<p>For now, the firm has a traditional disease-focused approach, targeting indications with the goal of preparing regulatory submissions, based around the science of mitochondria - small cells involved in the production of energy.</p>\n<p>When there are problems linked to the body&rsquo;s mitochondria, serious diseases can result, making them an ideal although still not fully understood target for research.</p>\n<p>CohBar was founded around some unique research discoveries, including the fact that there are peptide sequences in the mitochondria genome, which Mr Engle describes as &ldquo;a shocker to scientists.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Second was the fact that &ldquo;the peptides that are put out by these sequences regulate multiple organs and systems.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s scientists have published research showing the impact of these peptides from the mitochondria in areas of metabolism like diabetes, oncology and even longevity.</p>\n<p>He says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like if you discovered a whole new set of hormones that nobody knew existed - if somebody announced that tomorrow, people would go bonkers - I mean how could we not know this? That&rsquo;s the level of this discovery.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What differentiates the firm&rsquo;s approach is that, while other companies are seeking to fix the mitochondria themselves, CohBar is the only firm taking these sequences and seeking to create drugs from them.</p>\n<p>So far, the science has paved the way for an exciting pipeline with a huge amount of potential in multiple therapy areas.</p>\n<h2>Pipeline development</h2>\n<p>The company recently crowned CB5138-3 as its lead candidate for advancement into Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling activities.</p>\n<p>The candidate is a CB5138 analog, a novel class of molecules derived from a natural, mitochondrially encoded peptide source, with potential for treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and other fibrotic diseases.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting 2022 for clinical studies, building on positive pre-clinical data which show its potential as an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic for IPF, an unmet medical need with few treatment options.</p>\n<p>Mr Engle says the firm is &ldquo;funded through to the first quarter of next year and before then we expect to get results out of our Phase Ib as well as a few of the other key milestones.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The company was able to raise funds last year and is &ldquo;building up the awareness on the investment side as we go,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>With an initial focus on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity, CohBar has a clinical strategy driven by both scientific and commercial considerations.</p>\n<p>Analysts have forecast that there could be tens of billions of dollars in untapped revenues in treating NASH, an area of significant unmet medical need in which there are very few treatment options.</p>\n<p>Asked about taking the pipeline forward, and whether CohBar has considered partnering with big pharma, he says: &ldquo;In my previous companies we've built portfolios with multiple products, and once you have multiple products then some them you keep and some of them you partner.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think that's exactly what's going to happen with CohBar,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;A year ago people mostly saw us focused on NASH and obesity, but in the last year we made big strides in the other programs, bringing them forward.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The firm&rsquo;s breakthrough science looks likely to open up a meaningful therapeutic approach which, in the end, could be the most effective way to extend healthy lifespan.</p>", "date": "2021-03-23 11:46:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "CohBar, ageing, diseases, Engle, mitochondria, mitochondrial, firm, people, treating, focused, discoveries, shocker, scientists\u00e2\u0080\u009d, multiple, point, Nasdaq", "meta_description": "Californian ageing specialist CohBar (Nasdaq: CWBR) is focused on treating mitochondrial diseases, but chief executive Steven Engle doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rule out offering a ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-23 11:46:07", "updated": "2021-03-23 17:16:52", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cohbar-discoveries-a-shocker-to-scientists-says-ceo", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cohbar_big.jpg", "image2id": "cohbar_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "CEO Interviews, Drug Trial, Focus On, In Depth, Interviews, Management, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "CohBar", "drug_tag": "CB5138-3", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-23 11:46:00"}
