PH94B&rsquo;s MOA is, therefore, fundamentally differentiated from the MOA of benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, diazepam and lorazepam, which are direct GABA-A receptor positive modulators.</p>\n<p>Among VistaGen&rsquo;s core goals is for PH94B - rights to which it acquired from Pherin Pharmaceuticals in 2018 - to displace these and other widely-used but highly-addictive benzodiazepines in the acute treatment paradigm for SAD and other anxiety disorders and phobias.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key results in the recent ADAA poster presentation include the following:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>PH94B had no significant effect on GABA potentiation at doses up to 10 micromolar, compared to the 300% potentiation induced by diazepam, a commonly-prescribed benzodiazepine.</li>\n<li>The concentration of PH94B that gives the half-maximal response (EC50) could not be calculated for PH94B, whereas diazepam&rsquo;s half-maximal response (EC50) was 72 nanomolar.</li>\n<li>PH94B had no agonist or antagonist effects on GABA receptors compared to the effect of GABA (EC50= 4.7 micromolar) and bicuculline (EC50= 1.6 micromolar), respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;The results are in agreement with PH94B&rsquo;s lack of benzodiazepine-like side effects and safety concerns reported in PH94B clinical studies &ndash; for example, lack of sedation, cognitive impairment or abuse liability potential,&rdquo; said Dr Louis Monti, vice president, translational medicine of VistaGen. &ldquo;This study demonstrated that PH94B&rsquo;s mechanism of action is through neural regulation of forward inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the limbic amygdala and is differentiated from benzodiazepines&rsquo; mechanism of action, which is through a direct local potentiating effect on GABA receptors. These data are key in understanding PH94B&rsquo;s overall potential effectiveness and safety for individuals suffering from SAD and many other anxiety disorders,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the <a href=\"https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUaEgK7ooreyAWTCAYB17nPWury8IUoN-2F5LcVrjjrnVBtVe5vvTghCi-2B1IMHJF82F5eeeoj95Cgt2e3MzF3cQ-2FIU6I9dMDTgxeNpH5vGyA6Vk46VWuOsCSuVBuH-2FtQKvAlJfeLDfgE7XPRt4aYzYcx-2FUwKWm91e0hhFGby-2FqvTibKwSm0FzURtU-2Byy4zQgcfPlnHDVATT-2B45WvKrc-2BXodGL1-2BUSmFB-2FxWlUk8lFDmlZGdD5oiFZL1GhvPFAdhkmn6EhMUqcr-2BtoZx5xEmHiVyKPA9v4kAERFxi-2BprK2yb0NwfhuvLOdNHmzce3-2Fzq4zkkAI00pOdDiwc0RxJNxJBe-2B7FtMcYn4uPz1w-2Fc1sFbZr9RgNrI_kUSOyLKFh1DUjfbFLTjqYPSGTEyRmRgBhFgncVOnD15RsHNELV7fpp3RDaomW-2B6NYs0ZpPtzmcRC1n9ruU81Jlnkb1tq95ceKysePp9mg7Cbnd5ywjmWIYVIAoxGS-2BDOJylVcuRZy5MQPd-2Bn149JtGCi6-2FNld6FK9-2F0KmkvQu30OxWJ2y0WboB7IoWZXUiBQOcoVFFWPVn0PSgQuy-2F-2Fpzejm04zyDSmWJ65tbLT1tpigERnw-2BFlTeVLcDw4CUhntKUQxQC4n9Bzf4X-2BkvsmHLH5Kij1xlE1pZ4rXFAzTtv8hHQfEte3bASOZ00Wu-2FUoSGI5usoQkwwaqfnF0oc96fUMzEvn-2Ftj68-2F40OSrh-2BDcg-3D\">FDA&rsquo;s recent</a> Drug Safety Communication that outlined and highlighted the safety risks associated with benzodiazepine use, the implications resulting from this study are significant,&rdquo; added Dr Mark Smith, chief medical officer of VistaGen, adding: &ldquo;PH94B may have the potential to displace benzodiazepines altogether and become the safer alternative to help the millions of Americans suffering from anxiety with limited options for safe, effective treatment options.
