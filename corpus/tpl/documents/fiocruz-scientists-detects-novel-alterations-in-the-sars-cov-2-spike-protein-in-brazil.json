The Spike protein is associated with the pathogen's ability to enter human cells and is one of the main targets of the neutralizing antibodies produced by the body to block the virus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The institution says that one of the effects of this change is contributing to maintaining the critical scenario in the occupation of hospital beds. The greater presence of young people admitted to hospitals is reported by health professionals from different regions. This week's Fiocruz bulletin translates this impression into numbers, notes a report by The Rio Times. Cases in Brazil among young people has increased sixfold, the newspaper stated.</p>\n<h2><strong>Necessary to continue monitoring</strong></h2>\n<p>The scientists point out that, so far, few genomes show the changes and that it is not yet characterized as the formation of a Sars-CoV-2 new strain. However, they warn that it is necessary to continue monitoring to see if viruses with these changes will not increase in frequency.</p>\n<p>\"We can say that this is an early discovery, which emphasizes the importance of actions in genomic surveillance, such as the one carried out by the Fiocruz network,\" explains the head of Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses and Measles at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC/Fiocruz), researcher Marilda Siqueira. The Laboratory acts as a National Reference Center for respiratory viruses for the Ministry of Health and as a reference for the World Health Organization (WHO) in COVID-19 in the Americas.</p>\n<p>The Fiocruz Genomics Network researchers warn that the findings highlight the urgent need to scale up vaccination and implement effective non-pharmacological measures to mitigate community transmission and the more transmissible variants emergence. They also point to investment in genomic surveillance and vaccine efficacy studies for the new variants as key measures.</p>", "date": "2021-03-29 10:10:00", "meta_title": "Fiocruz scientists detects novel alterations in the Sars-CoV-2 Spike p", "meta_keywords": "Fiocruz, Sars-CoV-2, Spike protein, Alterations, Brazil, COVID-19", "meta_description": "Fiocruz scientists detects novel alterations in the Sars-CoV-2 Spike protein in Brazil", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-28 14:42:40", "updated": "2021-03-29 10:10:59", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fiocruz-scientists-detects-novel-alterations-in-the-sars-cov-2-spike-protein-in-brazil", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fiocruz_big.jpg", "image2id": "fiocruz_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": NaN, "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Brazil", "company_tag": "Fiocruz", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-29 10:10:00"}
