Merck KGaA&rsquo;s (MRK: DE) collaboration with Debiopharm has the potential to transform the current treatment paradigm for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by combining xevinapant, a new molecular entity, with Merck KGaA&rsquo;s strong commercialization capabilities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of the total licensing agreements signed, the highest recorded licensing agreements took place in North America, followed by Asia-Pacific, while the lowest recorded number of deals belonged to South and Central America.

The current clinical development pipeline has around 20 late-stage agents in the immuno-modulating therapy or cell inhibitor classes, thus revealing a robust late-stage pipeline that is highly conducive to future partnerships for licensing and commercialization, and is expected to contribute to significant market growth over the next ten years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many of these licensing deals involve strategic partnerships between Asia-Pacific, namely Chinese manufacturers, and US pharmaceuticals for joint clinical and commercial development of oncology assets, with the purpose of gaining market access in the USA.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While the currently marketed agents are patent protected, the introduction of drugs through these alliances poses competition for some of the premium-priced therapies, both from a market share and price perspective,&rdquo; Dr Rede said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While licensing agreements have been one of the key business development tactics in oncology, venture financing ($8.6 billion valuation), asset transactions ($4 billion valuation), and contract service agreements ($30 million valuation) are some of the other investment approaches considered in recent years to advance drug development science in the head and neck space by way of investment capitalism.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-24 12:20:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "head, neck, cancer, licensing, clinical, deal-making, late-stage, agreements, development, GlobalData, years, start, yielding, dividends, patients, market", "meta_description": "A frenzy of deal-making activity in head and neck cancer is bringing late-stage clinical candidates into view, according to GlobalData.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-24 12:15:42", "updated": "2021-03-24 12:46:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/deal-making-in-head-and-neck-cancer-to-start-yielding-dividends-for-patients", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "medicines_money_stock_large.jpg", "image2id": "medicines_money_stock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Head and neck cancer", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Global", "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb, Debiopharm, GlobalData, Merck & Co, Merck KGaA", "drug_tag": "Keytruda, Opdivo, xevinapant", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-24 12:20:00"}
