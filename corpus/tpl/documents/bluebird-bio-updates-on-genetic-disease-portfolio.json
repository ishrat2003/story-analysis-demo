This assessment, along with the re-classification of the originally reported MDS case to transfusion-dependent anemia are important steps in bluebird bio&rsquo;s path to seeking removal of the clinical hold on studies HGB-206 and HGB-210 of LentiGlobin for SCD.</p>\n<p>bluebird bio continues to work with regulators to resume its clinical studies in sickle cell disease as well as to remove the clinical hold for HGB-207 and HGB-212 clinical studies of beti-cel for &beta;-thalassemia, with potential lift of all clinical holds in mid-2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>Failed price negotiations for Zynteglo in Germany</strong></h2>\n<p>In Europe, reimbursement negotiations in Germany did not result in a price for Zynteglo that reflects the value of this one-time gene therapy with potential life-long benefit for people living with TDT. The price proposed by the German health authorities fails to recognize the severe burden of living with TDT or the innovation and benefit Zynteglo brings to patients who are impacted every day, throughout their lives by this severe genetic disease.</p>\n<p>bluebird bio said it continues with productive negotiations across countries in Europe and plans to continue to provide updates on the negotiation processes in the second half of 2021.</p>\n<p>On April 28, 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) renewed the CMA for beti-cel. The CMA for beti-cel is valid in the 27 member states of the EU as well as the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration granted beti-cel Orphan Drug status and Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of TDT. Beti-cel is not approved in the USA. Beti-cel continues to be evaluated in the ongoing Phase III Northstar-2 (HGB-207) and Northstar-3 (HGB-212) studies.</p>\n<p>In response to these and other events and shifts related to the business over the past year, bluebird bio plans to reduce and reshape its workforce, primarily in Europe. This reduction and reallocation of resources will allow the company to focus on priority European markets and streamline global operations going forward to ensure its ability to deliver gene therapies to patients based on bluebird bio&rsquo;s current business plans.</p>", "date": "2021-04-20 17:09:00", "meta_title": "bluebird bio updates on genetic disease portfolio", "meta_keywords": "bluebird bio, Genetic disease, Portfolio, LentiGlobin, Zynteglo, Sickle cell disease, Beta-thalassemia", "meta_description": "bluebird bio updates on genetic disease portfolio", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-20 17:07:54", "updated": "2021-04-20 17:17:53", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bluebird-bio-updates-on-genetic-disease-portfolio", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "bluebird_bio_large.jpg", "image2id": "bluebird_bio_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Management, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, USA", "company_tag": "bluebird bio", "drug_tag": "LentiGlobin, Zynteglo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-20 17:09:00"}
