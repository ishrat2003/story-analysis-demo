This is stated in a letter addressed to the Prime Minister of seven associations, including the Association of International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (AIPM), the Union of Professional Pharmaceutical Organizations (SPFO), the League of Patient Defenders, and the All-Russian Union of Patients.</p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical associations unite more than 60 companies, including Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Abbott (NYSE: ABT), AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Bayer (BAYN: DE), Servier, Merck (MRK: DE), Novartis (NOVN: VX), pharmacy chains - Neopharm, Rigla and others.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the essence of the sentence \"second extra\"</strong></h2>\n<p>The development of the so-called \"second extra\" proposal became known in March from the instructions of Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. The essence of the initiative is as follows: if a company from the EAEU countries enters the auction with a drug from the list of strategically significant ones, according to which the full cycle production is localized (from the synthesis of a molecule of a substance to mass production), then applications from other manufacturers that have such a production chain in within the framework of the union is not, rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As conceived by the ministry, the mechanism will not be applied if there are no applications from full cycle manufacturers or if a specific medicine is not produced on the territory of the EAEU. Now the initiative has not been accepted by the government, and the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Health are holding consultations in order to understand whether the entry into force of the decision to restrict the bidding will lead to a shortage of drugs.</p>\n<p>The authors of the letter call the provision of such preferences as a \"second extra\" for manufacturers of pharmaceutical substances as the forced introduction of an anticompetitive mechanism in the interests of a group of drug manufacturers.</p>\n<p>In addition, according to community representatives, the initiative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade will make the drug safety system in the country vulnerable due to the fact that small volumes of pharmaceutical substances will be unprofitable to produce. One of the consequences may be a shortage of drugs due to the fact that competition will be limited, which may even lead to the forced withdrawal of many manufacturers from the market, they say.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The country runs the risk of being left without certain drugs altogether if a full-cycle manufacturer cannot meet the need for the entire health care system,&rdquo; the appeal says.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Alexander Semyonov, president of Active Component, a Russian manufacturer of active ingredients, said in an interview with the Russian RBC business paper, the project of preferences for state purchases concerns only the list of 215 strategically important drugs. Those foreign companies that are ready to localize the production of ingredients will receive the same preferences as Russian ones.</p>", "date": "2021-04-19 10:12:00", "meta_title": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AIPM et al warn of dangers of a \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond extra\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "meta_keywords": "Russia, Production, Competition, Shortages, Legislation", "meta_description": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AIPM et al warn of dangers of a \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond extra\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-19 09:13:39", "updated": "2021-04-19 16:47:03", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-aipm-et-al-warn-of-dangers-of-a-second-extra", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "aipm-png.PNG", "image2id": "aipm-png.PNG", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Pharmaceuticals policy", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "All therapy areas", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Government Affairs, Production, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "AIPM, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-19 10:12:00"}
