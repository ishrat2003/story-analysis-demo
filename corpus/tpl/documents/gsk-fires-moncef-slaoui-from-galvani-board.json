Upon receipt of the letter, the GSK board immediately initiated an investigation with an experienced law firm to investigate the allegations. The investigation of Dr Slaoui&rsquo;s conduct substantiated the allegations and is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Dr Slaoui&rsquo;s behaviors are wholly unacceptable. They represent an abuse of his leadership position, violate company policies, and are contrary to the strong values that define GSK&rsquo;s culture, the UK pharma major stressed. The company expects everyone at GSK to behave in accordance with its values, especially its leaders where its standards are the highest. Sexual harassment and any abuse of leadership position are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p>Also, Dr Slaoui was swiftly fired from the chairman&rsquo;s role he held at Vaxcyte. And soon after that he also lost his role as CSO/advisor of Centessa, the big new startup out of Medicxi.</p>\n<p>After retiring from GSK, where he was chairman of global vaccines, in March 2017, Dr Slaoui joined the board of US biotech firm Moderna (Nasdaq: RMNA), which has been at the forefront of COVID-19 treatment with the company&rsquo;s investigational mRNA vaccine candidate mRNA-1273. In May last year former US President Donald Trump appointed Dr Slaoui as chief scientist of Operation Warp Speed, the objective of which is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Christopher Corsico, senior vice president development at GSK and a current member of the Galvani board, has been appointed as the new chairman of Galvani. In addition, Amy Altshul, SVP Legal, R&amp;D and global commercial franchises at GSK, has also been appointed to the board.</p>\n<p>Galvani Bioelectronics is a medical research company dedicated to the development of bioelectronic medicines to treat chronic diseases. Formed through a partnership between two global healthcare companies, GSK and Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences), a subsidiary of Alphabet in 2016, Galvani Bioelectronics combines life science knowledge with expertise in software and electronics for clinical applications.</p>", "date": "2021-03-24 18:07:00", "meta_title": "GSK fires Moncef Slaoui from Galvani board", "meta_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline, Galvani, Moncef Slaoui, Fired, Chairmanship, Terminated, Sexual harassment", "meta_description": "GSK fires Moncef Slaoui from Galvani board", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-24 18:07:02", "updated": "2021-03-25 11:52:21", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gsk-fires-moncef-slaoui-from-galvani-board", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "glaxosmithkline_gsk_large.jpg", "image2id": "glaxosmithkline_gsk_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Boardroom, Management", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "Galvani Bioelectronics, GlaxoSmithKline", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": "Moncef Slaoui", "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-24 18:07:00"}
