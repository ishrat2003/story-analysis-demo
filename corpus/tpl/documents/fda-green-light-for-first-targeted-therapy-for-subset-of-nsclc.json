Rybrevant is the first FDA-approved targeted therapy for patients with these mutations, which are the third most prevalent acting EGFR mutations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This milestone also marks Janssen&rsquo;s first approval for the treatment of patients with lung cancer and reflects the progress it has made to develop and deliver transformational therapies to people diagnosed with some of the most complex diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rybrevant is the product of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/genmab-in-collaboration-with-janssen-for-duobody-platform\">2012 licensing agreement</a>&nbsp;in which J&amp;J contracted with Denmark-based Genmab (OMX: GEN) to make use of its DuoBody technology platform. The Danish firm became eligible for milestone and license payments of up to $175 million for each product, plus royalties.</p>\n<p>The FDA also approved the Guardant 360 CDx (from Guardant Health Inc), a blood-based next-generation sequencing test designed to detect alterations in 55 genes, as a companion diagnostic to identify patients eligible for amivantamab.</p>\n<h2><strong>Precision oncology advances continue to facilitate drug development, says FDA</strong></h2>\n<p>\"Advances in precision oncology continue to facilitate drug development, allowing diseases like lung cancer to be subset into biomarker-defined populations appropriate for targeted therapies,\" said Dr Julia Beaver, chief of medical oncology in the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence and acting deputy director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"With today's approval, for the first time, patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations will have a targeted treatment option,\" she noted.</p>\n<p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality for both men and women. For 2021, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that there will be 235,760 lung cancer cases, equating to 12.4% of new cancer cases but 21.7% of cancer deaths.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing </strong></h2>\n<p>Researchers evaluated Rybrevant's efficacy in a study of 81 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The main outcome measured was overall response rate (proportion of patients whose tumor is destroyed or reduced by a drug). In the trial population in which all patients received Rybrevant, the overall response rate was 40%. The median duration of response was 11.1 months, with 63% of patients having a duration of response of 6 months or more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This review was conducted under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3172413-1&amp;h=2427925446&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fabout-fda%2Foncology-center-excellence%2Fproject-orbis&amp;a=Project+Orbis\">Project Orbis</a>,&nbsp;an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.
