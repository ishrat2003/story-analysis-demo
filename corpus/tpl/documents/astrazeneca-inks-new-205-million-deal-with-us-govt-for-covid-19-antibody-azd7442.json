It included the option to acquire additional doses in 2021. The company also has a separate agreement to supply the DoD with 100,000 doses, bringing potential US supplies of AZD7442 to 700,000 in 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>Financial terms</strong></h2>\n<p>The value of the extended agreement is $205 million and is contingent on AZD7442 receiving Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization in post-exposure prophylaxis - the ability to prevent COVID-19 in people who have confirmed exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>\n<p>Together, the total value of current agreements with the US government for the development and supply of AZD7442 in 2021 is about $726 million. The extended agreement is not anticipated to impact the company's financial guidance for 2021.</p>\n<p>The news comes amid concerns that the Anglo-Swedish pharma major&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is linked to a small number of blood clots in people who have received the jab, though the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency the UK regulator have strongly supported its safety.</p>\n<h2><strong>Potential to offer almost immediate protection</strong></h2>\n<p>Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;The long-acting antibody combination has the potential to offer almost immediate protection to those who are not able to be vaccinated, to both prevent infection or treat the disease in patients already infected with the virus. The US government&rsquo;s support is critical in helping accelerate the development of AZD7442, which we believe will be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19<em>.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>AZD7442 is currently being evaluated for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in late-stage trials in more than 9,000 participants around the world. The two-LAAB combination has been engineered with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s proprietary half-life extension technology which triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies. The combination of LAABs is also designed to reduce the risk of resistance developed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.</p>", "date": "2021-03-16 10:21:00", "meta_title": "AstraZeneca inks new $205 million deal with US govt for COVID-19 antib", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, COVID-19 antibody, AZD7442, Contract, HHS, DoD", "meta_description": "AstraZeneca inks new $205 million deal with US govt for COVID-19 antibody AZD7442", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-16 09:59:57", "updated": "2021-03-16 10:21:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astrazeneca-inks-new-205-million-deal-with-us-govt-for-covid-19-antibody-azd7442", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca_big.jpg", "image2id": "astrazeneca_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "US government", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On, Government Affairs", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "AZD7442", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-16 10:21:00"}
