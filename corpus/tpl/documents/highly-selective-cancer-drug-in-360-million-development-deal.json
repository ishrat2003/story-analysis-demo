master service agreement with Australian oncology-focussed biotech Kazia Therapeutics.", "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamburg, Germany-based Evotec (EVT: Xetra) has entered into both a licensing and master service agreement with Australian oncology-focussed biotech Kazia Therapeutics (ASX: KZA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the terms of the deal, Evotec will grant Kazia an exclusive worldwide license for research, development and commercialization of its oncology project EVT801.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EVT801 is a pre-clinical-stage, orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the lymphatic growth factor receptor VEGFR3, originally developed within Evotec's </span><a

400;\"> with French pharma major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN).</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Highly targeted therapy</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firms believe that VEGFR3 has an advantage over other VEGF receptors, in that it is more selective, thereby potentially avoiding the significant toxicity seen with many such candidates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidate could therefore combine high efficacy both against the primary tumor and lymphatic-borne metastases with a highly favorable toxicology profile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kazia is planning to clinically evaluate EVT801 both as a single agent and in combination with immunotherapy in a set of specific oncology indications.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evotec will manage a Phase I trial under the full sponsorship of Kazia, with the Australian firm taking responsibility for any subsequent clinical evaluation and commercialisation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as a small upfront payment, Evotec is eligible to receive clinical and commercial milestones of more than 300 million euros ($361 million), as well as tiered high single-digit royalties on the net sales of EVT801, which will be shared with Sanofi.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kazia chief executive James Garner said: &ldquo;Evotec have done first-class work in the early development of EVT801, and the pre-clinical data package is exceptionally strong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added: &ldquo;Our intention is to fast track a phase I clinical trial of the drug, which we expect to commence in CY2021.\"</span></p>",
