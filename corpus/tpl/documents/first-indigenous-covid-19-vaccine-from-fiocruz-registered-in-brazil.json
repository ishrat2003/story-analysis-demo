With the registration, the expectation is that ANVISA will authorize the release of the first batches, so that Fiocruz can deliver to the PNI the first one million Covid-19 vaccines produced by the institution.</p>\n<p>\"Just six months after signing the Technology Order Agreement, we have already started production of a COVID-19 vaccine, based on one of the most advanced technologies at the moment, and obtained its registration for wide distribution in the country. The urgency imposed on us by the seriousness of this pandemic has made everyone involved work tirelessly and be able to accomplish in months a process that normally takes years. This also would not be possible without all of Anvisa's technical support at every step of the ongoing submission process. This is a historical day for Fiocruz and for the Single Health System,\" commented Fiocruz's president, N&iacute;sia Trindade Lima.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Second production line started</strong></h2>\n<p>Also, on March 12, a second production line of the vaccine was started, which increases the production capacity of the Immunobiological Technology Institute (Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz). The first line in operation was already producing about 300,000 doses per day. The expectation is to reach the end of March with production of about one million doses per day.</p>\n<p>With this, the Foundation expects to deliver 3.8 million doses to the Ministry of Health by the end of March. In April, the delivery estimate will increase to about 30 million doses, and by July Fiocruz should complete the delivery of the 100 million doses resulting from the technology order agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A vaccine registered by the Agency, with a production stage already carried out in Brazil, represents greater autonomy to the country and access to the vaccine,&rdquo; explained Anvisa's general manager of medications, Gustavo Mendes, during the statement broadcast by the ANVISA.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>", "date": "2021-03-22 10:14:00", "meta_title": "First indigenous COVID-19 vaccine, from Fiocruz, registered in Brazil", "meta_keywords": "Fiocruz, COVID-19, Vaccine, Registered, Ansiva, Production", "meta_description": "First indigenous COVID-19 vaccine, from Fiocruz, registered in Brazil", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-20 16:46:42", "updated": "2021-03-22 17:05:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/first-indigenous-covid-19-vaccine-from-fiocruz-registered-in-brazil", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fiocruz_big.jpg", "image2id": "fiocruz_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Production, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Brazil", "company_tag": "Ag\u00c3\u00aancia Nacional de Vigil\u00c3\u00a2ncia Sanit\u00c3\u00a1ria, ANVISA, Fiocruz", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-22 10:14:00"}
