The NCI is also conducting a separate Phase II trial of berzosertib in combination with topotecan versus topotecan monotherapy in SCLC that has relapsed (NCT03896503) which is currently the only randomized controlled trial of the combination in this population.</p>\n<p>Merck also initiated a global Phase II study to further assess berzosertib in combination with topotecan for the treatment of relapsed, platinum-resistant SCLC. The first patient has been enrolled in the open-label, single-arm trial, which plans to include approximately 80 participants at about 41 study sites across Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>\n<h2><strong>These cancers associated with very poor prognoses</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Small-cell neuroendocrine cancers, including small cell lung cancer, are associated with very poor prognoses, and are a major clinical challenge with no effective therapeutic options. In this study, the combination of berzosertib and topotecan showed higher than expected response rates and durable responses in patients with platinum-resistant SCLC, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this combination for patients with this recalcitrant cancer type,&rdquo; said Dr Anish Thomas, investigator and NIH Lasker Clinical Research Scholar at the Developmental Therapeutics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, and lead investigator of the study.</p>\n<p>Dr Thomas is collaborating with Merck through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are encouraged by these promising results, and are eager to further investigate berzosertib in a potentially registrational trial in SCLC as part of our front-running leadership in the research of DNA damage response,&rdquo; said Dr Danny Bar-Zohar, global head of development for the Healthcare business sector of Merck.</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 10:04:00", "meta_title": "Merck advances ATR inhibitor berzosertib in small cell lung cancer", "meta_keywords": "Merck KGaA, Berzosertib, M6620, Cancer, Lung, SCLS, Phase II", "meta_description": "Merck advances ATR inhibitor berzosertib in small cell lung cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-12 16:36:31", "updated": "2021-04-13 10:04:23", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-advances-atr-inhibitor-berzosertib-in-small-cell-lung-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "merck_kgaa_new_large.jpg", "image2id": "merck_kgaa_new_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany", "company_tag": "Merck KGaA", "drug_tag": "berzosertib, M6620", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 10:04:00"}
