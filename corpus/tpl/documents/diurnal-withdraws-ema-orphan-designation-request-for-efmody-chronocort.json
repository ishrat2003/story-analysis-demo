{"contentid": 488357, "importid": NaN, "name": "Diurnal withdraws EMA orphan designation request for Efmody/Chronocort", "introduction": "UK endocrine diseases specialist Diurnal Group has withdrawn its application for maintenance of orphan designation in Europe for Efmody (hydrocortisone modified-release hard capsules), a drug formerly known as Chronocort.", "content": "<p>UK endocrine diseases specialist Diurnal Group (AIM: DNL) has withdrawn its application for maintenance of orphan designation in Europe for Efmody (hydrocortisone modified-release hard capsules), a drug formerly known as Chronocort.</p>\n<p>This follows feedback from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), an advisory committee to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p>\n<p>Diurnal has decided that continuing pursuit of an orphan designation for the drug would be likely to cause a significant delay in its European commercial launch. First commercial launch is currently anticipated to be in the third quarter of this year.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\">\"A robust, granted European patent estate provides market exclusivity for the drug until at least 2033\"</span>Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), an advisory committee of the EMA, issued a positive opinion to the European Commission recommending Efmody as treatment of adult and adolescent patients with the rare condition congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).</p>\n<p>The formal approval of marketing authorization from the European Commission for Efmody, which is not dependant on the maintenance of orphan designation, continues to be anticipated in June 2021, in accordance with the 67-day mandated timeline following the adoption of a positive opinion by the CHMP.</p>\n<p>In anticipation of this and commercial launch shortly thereafter, market access activities in Diurnal&rsquo;s target European territories are underway.</p>\n<p>Orphan designation provides for market exclusivity for 10 years from launch. However, the company currently holds granted European patents for Efmody for the treatment of patients with both CAH and adrenal insufficiency (AI) and believes these patents provide sufficient protection for Efmody until at least 2033 in all designated states covered by the European Patent Convention.</p>\n<p>In addition, while orphan designation can be used to support premium pricing in certain territories, Diurnal does not believe that this is critical to the overall commercial potential of the product given the significant clinical need for new therapies in CAH.</p>\n<p>Martin Whitaker, chief executive of Diurnal, said: &ldquo;Following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP we are focussed on the timely launch of Efmody in Q3 2021. Orphan Designation for Efmody in Europe is not critical to the commercial potential of the product in this market.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There remains a strong clinical rationale for the drug&rsquo;s use to address the significant need for new therapies to improve outcomes for adult patients with CAH. This was highlighted recently in the paper in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism that detailed our pivotal clinical trial data and results from a long-term extension study. Additionally, a robust, granted European patent estate provides market exclusivity for the drug until at least 2033.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 14:50:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "orphan, designation, European, Diurnal, Efmody, drug, market, launch, commercial, committee, maintenance, Europe, withdraws, exclusivity, Efmody/Chronocort", "meta_description": "UK endocrine diseases specialist Diurnal Group has withdrawn its application for maintenance of orphan designation in Europe for Efmody (hydrocortisone modified", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 12:56:50", "updated": "2021-04-15 14:50:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/diurnal-withdraws-ema-orphan-designation-request-for-efmody-chronocort", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "diurnal_logo-_big.jpg", "image2id": "diurnal_logo_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Endocrinology", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": "Diurnal Group, The European Medicines Agency", "drug_tag": "Chronocort, Efmody", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 14:50:00"}
