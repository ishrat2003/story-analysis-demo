Editor</p>\n<p>Among last week&rsquo;s notable news, AstraZeneca released long-waited data from the US Phase III trial of its COVID-1 vaccine, AZD1222, which pave the way for US regulatory approval and restore confidence in Europe, but this was not without further controversy. Roche and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals reported strong Phase III data for their REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pfizer and Eli Lilly suffered a setback on their osteoarthritis pain drug tanezumab, with a negative Food and Drug Administration advisory committee vote. Dutch rare diseases firm ProQR Therapeutics announced encouraging early-stage results for its QR-421a in Usher syndrome, a rare blindness disorder.</p>\n<h2><strong>AstraZeneca silences its COVID-19 vaccine doubters</strong></h2>\n<p>If the previous pivotal studies of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (AZD1222) were confusing, the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strong-data-clear-path-for-new-covid-19-vaccine-in-usa\">results from its US Phase III trial</a> are clear: the vaccine works and does not increase the risk of blood clots, noted Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>AZD1222 showed efficacy of 79% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, rising to 100% against severe disease and hospitalisations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca plans to file AZD1222 in the US in the first half of April, its head of biopharmaceuticals, Ruud Dobber, said on a media call Monday. An emergency use authorization looks like a foregone conclusion given that Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s one-shot version of JNJ-78436735 got the go-ahead on apparently weaker data, although the usual caveats about cross-trial comparisons apply.</p>\n<p>There will also be pressure on the agency to push AZD1222 through quickly as the USA has pre-ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca jab, on a par with the contribution from Pfizer and Moderna. If and when AstraZeneca&rsquo;s shot gets the green light, the company is ready to deliver 30 million doses immediately, with another 20 million to follow later the same month, Mr Dobber said.</p>\n<p>The biggest unanswered question, though, concerns AZD1222&rsquo;s efficacy against emerging variants. AstraZeneca had no data to share here today, but the trial is sequencing confirmed Covid-19 cases to determine which variant is responsible, with data to be reported &ldquo;in due course,&rdquo; a spokesperson told <em>Evaluate Vantage</em>.</p>\n<p>The real significance of the results may lie beyond the USA, according to Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University&rsquo;s School of Public Health, quoted by EndPoints News.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have a fourth vaccine here in the US, but by the time this is authorized, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna be looking for a lot more vaccines here. We&rsquo;ll have plenty. But it may add to our stockpiles,&rdquo; he said on the Today show. &ldquo;I think the bigger issue is global. This vaccine &mdash; there are hundreds of millions of doses of this being made around the world, and we really need to vaccinate the world. Remember, this is a global pandemic, and it will come to an end when the world is vaccinated. This is our best ticket toward vaccinating the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Much ado about nothing</strong></p>\n<p>Later in the week, AstraZeneca released an <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/more-positive-data-clarify-picture-on-astrazeneca-jab\">updated analysis of the data</a>, on which Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Jacob Plieth commented, noting that the storm over a US pivotal trial of the Covid-19 vaccine AZN1222 could be fizzling out. AstraZeneca said the study&rsquo;s final primary analysis yielded vaccine efficacy of 76% &ndash; only slightly below Monday&rsquo;s disputed 79% interim figure.</p>\n<p>If 76% efficacy is accurate the obvious question is what would have moved the NIAID to start its extraordinary row with the company. The spotlight is on AstraZeneca&rsquo;s revelation of an extra 14 possible Covid-19 cases in the trial that have yet to be adjudicated. However, even if all occurred on AZN1222 &ndash; a highly unlikely worst-case scenario &ndash; the numbers do not change hugely, <em>Evaluate Vantage </em>calculates.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the pressure is now on the NIAID to spell out its case to avoid further undermining confidence in the vaccine. That confidence has been shaken in no small part by Astra&rsquo;s own evasiveness and lack of clarity at several points in AZN1222&rsquo;s development.</p>\n<h2><strong>REGN-COV2 looks better and better, giving insurance against vaccine failure</strong></h2>\n<p>Last Tuesday Regeneron and Roche announced positive <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roche-cocktail-stops-coronavirus-and-key-variants\">top-line results from their REGN-COV2</a> Phase III trial (n=4,567) in high-risk non-hospitalized patient setting, commented SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges. The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% and 71% with 1200mg and 2400mg, respectively, versus placebo. We believe the conclusive results that show REGN-COV2, even at the lower dose, can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in the outpatient setting is important since it could increase both utilization and supply.</p>\n<p>The positive results also move the company one step closer to prophylaxis for high risk or exposed individuals, which is likely to be even more useful in responding to the endemic or pandemic cases of COVID. The confirmation that the lower 1,200mg dose has comparable efficacy to 2400mg is also meaningful for supply. In the government purchase agreement in January, REGN expects to supply 750,000 finished doses by the end of June based on the 2400mg dose; this could expand to 1.25 million doses when the 1,200mg dose is authorized and could double the expected revenue (the contract was per dose, not per mg). Mr Porges also believes that REGN-COV2 is well positioned to play a complementary role to vaccines as it appears to be the most effective antibody against emerging immuno-resistant variants.</p>\n<p>Regeneron clarified that it expects revenue from REGN-CoV2 of approximately $321 million in the first quarter of this year, which is the remainder of the $466 million initial government contract, and now expect most of the revenue from the sale of 1.2 million doses of the 1,200mg dose in the second quarter, presumably at the same government contracted price of $2100/dose. This suggests that revenue in the second quarter could be as high as $2.6 billion, which compares to our estimate of $1.5 billion and consensus of $1.3 billion. Depending on the trajectory of the pandemic, further revenue could accrue in third and fourth quarter this year and will almost certainly be generated by international markets where vaccine uptake has been slower and case loads are therefore likely to be higher for longer.</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA panel slaps down Pfizer&rsquo;s storied osteoarthritis drug</strong></h2>\n<p>On Thursday, the FDA&rsquo;s joint meeting of the Arthritis and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (AdCom) <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-joint-adcom-returns-negative-vote-on-tanezumab-for-osteo-pain\">issued a resounding rejection</a> (19 &ldquo;No&rdquo;, 1 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;) of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for Pfizer/Eli Lilly&rsquo;s NGF antibody, tanezumab, for the treatment of osteoarthritis, noted SVB Leerink&rsquo;s Geoffrey Porges.</p>\n<p>While the AdCom did not vote for or against approval, this resounding vote and the FDA&rsquo;s comments and briefing document suggest that the members and reviewers see the benefit from the drug as modest and the risk as significant. In this context, we believe it is sensible to push out the timing for the approval and launch of tanezumab by two years (to 2023) and to reduce its probability to 35% (from 65% previously). Leerink has made similar changes to its timing and probability estimate for Regeneron&rsquo;s fasinumab (partnered with Teva), but its Regeneron forecast is adjusted to account for increased sales of their COVID antibody medicine, REGN-COV2, which now seems likely to generate greater revenue, from its lower dose and better competitive position, than we had previously forecast. These changes reduce Mr Porges&rsquo; price target for Pfizer by $1 to $39 and increase his price target for Regeneron by $2 to $657.</p>\n<p>At the very least, Pfizer and its partner Lilly will need to demonstrate longer-term safety, and propose a more practical REMS solution, to secure approval, which he expects to take at least another two years. The voting outcome is a disappointment for Pfizer and Lilly and a general blow to other nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors in development (Regeneron/Teva&rsquo;s fasinumab), but he believes investor expectations are already modest for tanezumab with consensus peak sales of $520 million in 2030 (Leerink&rsquo;s current estimate is $268 million).</p>\n<p>Adding his voice, EndPoints News&rsquo; Zachary Brennan notes that outside experts advising the FDA voted 19 to 1 against Pfizer&rsquo;s potential osteoarthritis drug tanezumab, saying the proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) will not ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. One of the two consumer reps voted yes. He cites examples of the panalists&rsquo; comments.</p>\n<p>Edward Cheng, professor of reconstructive surgery at the University of Minnesota, said tanezumab &ldquo;does not fill&rdquo; the unmet need for an effective drug for osteoarthritis and chronic arthritis pain, explaining that it&rsquo;s no better than aspirin or ibuprofen, or even placebo.</p>\n<p>Panelist Lewis Nelson, chief of the division of medical toxicology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said: &ldquo;I have serious concerns with the proposed REMS being effective&hellip;We don&rsquo;t know what happens behind closed doors, and even iron-clad REMS with strict guardrails have failed. And this one is a little bit looser than those.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jasvinder Singh, committee member and professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, called for a longer-term study with much larger samples, and there would have to be additional insights with regards to the understanding of the pathophysiology and biology of what leads to this rapidly progressing osteoarthritis, which the REMS is meant to help mitigate.</p>\n<h2><strong>ProQR hopes to &lsquo;usherin&rsquo; a new ophthalmic therapy</strong></h2>\n<p>Mixed mid-stage data on <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rna-therapy-shows-positive-trial-results-for-rare-blindness-disorders\">ProQR&rsquo;s exon skipper QR-421a</a> in the rare ophthalmic disorder Usher syndrome were released early on Wednesday morning to widespread apathy. The day after, however, the company&rsquo;s stock shot up 61%. It is not clear why this reaction was delayed, commented Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Elizabeth Cairns.</p>\n<p>Neither is it clear that it was justified. The Phase I/II Stellar trial data are apparently enough for ProQR to push ahead with pivotal studies, but they are not wildly positive, and the number of patients is small. There is one thing in the company&rsquo;s favor, however: should Phase III show a more definite benefit, ProQR looks likely to have the Usher&rsquo;s market to itself for some time, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Evercore ISI analysts, a three-line gain on the standard chart used for BCVA is considered clinically meaningful by the FDA. Since there are five letters in each line on the chart, Stellar appears to have missed this threshold. It is close to meeting the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s requirement for meaningfulness, however, at least in the advanced patient cohort: the EU agency has set this at a gain of two lines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The only other project in active clinical development specifically for Usher syndrome &ndash; excluding lapsed trials, natural history studies and academic work &ndash; appears to be a form of N-acetylcysteine amide under investigation by the Texan group Nacuity Pharmaceuticals. The Slo-RP trial compares an oral therapy, NPI-001, versus placebo in 48 patients with retinitis pigmentosa associated with Usher syndrome.</p>", "date": "2021-03-28 13:37:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 26, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, AstraZeneca, AZD1222, US trial, Roche, Regeneron, REGN-COV2, COVID-19, Cocktail, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Tanezumab, Osteoarthritis, ProQR, QR-421a.", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 26, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-28 13:33:56", "updated": "2021-03-28 13:52:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-26-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Infectious diseases, Ophthalmics, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche", "drug_tag": "AZD1222, COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, QR-421a, REGN-COV2, tanezumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-28 13:37:00"}
