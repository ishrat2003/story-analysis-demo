DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Japan, accounting for 30%-40% of all B-cell cases diagnosed, and is especially prevalent among people in their 60&rsquo;s. There is currently no established standard-of-care treatment for patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma, which underscores the need for new treatments for in this disease area. Follicular lymphoma accounts for 10%-20% of all B-cell NHL cases in Japan. Patients initially respond to chemotherapy, but relapse is common, especially in advanced-stage patients. There is also no established standard-of-care treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma grade 3B.</p>\n<h2><strong>Pricing still to be agreed</strong></h2>\n<p>The company has not said how much the drug will cost in Japan, where prices are negotiated with the government and, only after that has been agreed, can a drug be launched. However, in the USA, Bristol Myers set a <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-breyanzi-new-treatment-for-b-cell-lymphoma\">list price of $410,300 for Breyanzi</a>, about 10% more than the $373,000 price set by both Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Novartis (NOVN: VX) Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) when they launched their respective treatments in the USA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yescarta was approved in Japan in January this year. Kymriah on May 22, 2019 was cleared for listing with a National Health Insurance (NHI) with a price tag of some 33.5 million yen ($305,800).</p>\n<p>Jean-Christophe Barland, president and chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb KK and Celgene KK, said: \"I am pleased that we have received regulatory approval in Japan for Breyanzi, our first CAR-T cell therapy, which will allow us to provide a new treatment option for patients fighting relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. In addition, we are filing an application for a further CAR-T cell therapy to address more unmet medical needs. As a game-changer committed to 'innovation with heart', Bristol Myers Squibb will continue on its journey to help patients prevail over serious diseases.\"</p>\n<p>Breyanzi was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 5, 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B.</p>\n<p>Breyanzi is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.
