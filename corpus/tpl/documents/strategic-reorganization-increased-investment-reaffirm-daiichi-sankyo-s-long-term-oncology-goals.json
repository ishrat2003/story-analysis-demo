It was initially approved for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in the USA, Japan and in the EU in December 2019, March 2020 and January 2021, respectively. It is being further evaluated in nine registrational trials for additional HER2 cancer indications, including breast, gastric and lung cancers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Other ADCs in development</strong></h2>\n<p>Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd, DS-1062) and patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd, U3-1402), both in Phase II, are the other two major ADCs. There are five other DXd-ADCs and additional second-generation ADCs, new concept ADCs, bispecific antibodies, gene and cell therapies in Daiichi Sankyo&rsquo;s oncology pipeline.</p>\n<p>Sasmitha Sahu, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Daiichi Sankyo got a strategic breakthrough with Enhertu becoming the fastest FDA approved biologic in oncology through the accelerated approval program within two months of submission based on its registrational Phase II study data. Although its current oncology foundation is based on three highly potential ADCs, including trastuzumab, it is trying to build up new growth drivers by conducting additional lifecycle management studies and diversifying its pipeline to gain a &lsquo;competitive advantage in oncology&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Five-year business plan</strong></h2>\n<p>Daiichi Sankyo established a new oncology business unit in April 2021. Subsequently, the company announced in its five-Year Business Plan (FY2021\u00e2\u0080\u0092FY2025) that it expects to achieve a target of 1.6 trillion yen ($14 billion), including 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) by fiscal year 2025. It aims to achieve this by increasing its oncology product share over non-oncology products to 95% and 45% in the US and EU markets, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The strategic targets outlined in the 2016-2020 5-Year Business Plan were achieved with the international market entry of its first ADC therapy Enhertu in 2020.</p>\n<p>Ms Sahu adds: &ldquo;Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise unit was involved in its ADC oncology pipeline advancement through strategic planning and prioritization. The new business unit establishment will now deal with the commercial aspects of the oncology businesses following product launches, mainly in the US and EU markets where it expects to gain significant market share.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the company will invest over 1.5 trillion yen in its three ADCs through 2025. It has also invested 15 billion yen in manufacturing facilities for ADCs.</p>\n<p>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center, Daiichi Sankyo ranks second in Japan in terms of R&amp;D investment while it is the fifth largest company in Japan in terms of revenue with an annual revenue of $9 billion in FY2020.</p>\n<h2><strong>Deals with AstraZeneca and Seagen</strong></h2>\n<p>Daiichi-Sankyo has entered into a new co-development and collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) for datopotamab and a clinical trial collaboration for patritumab and osimertinib combination in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Lately, Daiichi Sankyo is facing litigation with Seagen (Nasdaq: SGEN) over its ADC technology.</p>\n<p>Ms Sahu concludes: &ldquo;Building on the successful outcomes for trastuzumab (Enhertu) collaboration with AstraZeneca, Daiichi-Sankyo is trying to expand its global outreach by entering into a further series of collaborations with AstraZeneca, which is one of the top global oncology players. Barring offsets caused by litigation, augmented R&amp;D and manufacturing investments, and strategic alliances will collectively drive Daiichi Sankyo&rsquo;s oncology revenues.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 11:14:00", "meta_title": "Strategic reorganization, increased investment reaffirm Daiichi Sankyo", "meta_keywords": "Daiichi Sankyo, Reorganization, Investment, Goals, Oncology, Five-year plan, Enhertu, Datopotamab deruxtecan, Patritumab deruxtecan, GlobalData", "meta_description": "Strategic reorganization, increased investment reaffirm Daiichi Sankyo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term oncology goals", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 11:06:14", "updated": "2021-05-21 11:16:44", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strategic-reorganization-increased-investment-reaffirm-daiichi-sankyo-s-long-term-oncology-goals", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "daiichi-hq.jpg", "image2id": "daiichi-hq-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Financial, Management, Research", "geography_tag": "Japan", "company_tag": "Daiichi Sankyo", "drug_tag": "datopotamab deruxtecan, Enhertu, patritumab deruxtecan", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 11:14:00"}
