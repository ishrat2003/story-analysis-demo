{"contentid": 487956, "importid": NaN, "name": "FDA approves use of Actemra/RoActemra in interstitial lung disease", "introduction": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) subcutaneous injection for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), a debilitating condition with limited treatment options.", "content": "<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) subcutaneous injection for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), a debilitating condition with limited treatment options.</p>\n<p>Roche&rsquo;s (ROG: SIX) Actemra/RoActemra is the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of the disease, the Swiss pharma giant noted. Mainly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Actemra/RoActemra pulled in global sales of 2.9 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) in full-year 2020, a rise of 32%.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is an often devastating autoimmune disease that worsens over time and has no cure. It occurs when the immune system malfunctions causing tissues of the skin and lungs to thicken and harden. SSc affects about 2.5 million people worldwide. Interstitial lung disease (ILD), which may occur in around 80% of SSc patients, causes inflammation and scarring of the lungs and can be life-threatening.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The FDA approval is based on data from the focuSSced trial, a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 212 adults with systemic sclerosis. Supportive information was also used from the faSScinate trial, a Phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SSc.</p>\n<p>The focuSSced trial did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 48 in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), which is a standard outcome measure for skin fibrosis (the scarring or hardening of the skin) in SSc. There also was not a statistically-significant effect on the primary endpoint of mRSS in the faSScinate trial.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are honored to offer the very first FDA-approved biologic treatment option to people living with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer and head of global product development, adding: &ldquo;We worked closely with the FDA to evaluate Actemra/RoActemra&rsquo;s impact on lung function in this setting. This milestone approval provides a much-needed new treatment option for people living with this rare, debilitating disease.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-05 11:05:00", "meta_title": "FDA approves use of Actemra/RoActemra in interstitial lung disease", "meta_keywords": "Roche, Actemra, RoActemra, FDA, Approval, Interstitial lung disease,  SSc-ILD", "meta_description": "FDA approves use of Actemra/RoActemra in interstitial lung disease", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-05 11:03:34", "updated": "2021-03-05 11:24:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-use-of-actemra-roactemra-in-interstitial-lung-disease", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "roche_basel_large-1.jpg", "image2id": "roche_basel_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Roche", "drug_tag": "Actemra/RoActemra", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": "Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease", "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-05 11:05:00"}
