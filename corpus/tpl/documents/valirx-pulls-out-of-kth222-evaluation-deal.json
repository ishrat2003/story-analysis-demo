By identifying early in this process that KTH222 is not a good strategic fit for our pipeline, we have been able to return the asset to the originators and continue our efforts to seek new science to bring into the Company. We look forward to presenting the next new project to the pipeline in due course,\" noted ValiRx chief executive Dr Suzy Dilly.</p>", "date": "2021-05-27 11:59:00", "meta_title": "ValiRx pulls out of KTH222 evaluation deal", "meta_keywords": "ValiRx, Kalos Therapeutics, Agreement, KTH222, Evaluation, Terminated", "meta_description": "ValiRx pulls out of KTH222 evaluation deal", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-27 11:58:33", "updated": "2021-05-27 12:05:10", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/valirx-pulls-out-of-kth222-evaluation-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "valirx-large.png", "image2id": "valirx-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Research", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Kalos Therapeutics, ValiRx", "drug_tag": "KTH222", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-27 11:59:00"}
