{"contentid": 488780, "importid": NaN, "name": "Amgen scores a first with FDA approval of Lumakras", "introduction": "The US Food and Drug Administration approved Lumakras (sotorasib: AMG 510) as the first treatment for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a specific type of genetic mutation called KRAS G12C and who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.", "content": "<p>The US Food and Drug Administration approved Lumakras (sotorasib: AMG 510) as the first treatment for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a specific type of genetic mutation called KRAS G12C and who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.</p>\n<p>Developed by US biotech giant Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), this is the first approved targeted therapy for tumors with any KRAS mutation, which accounts for around 25% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers. KRAS G12C mutations represent about 13% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers, the FDA noted. Amgen&rsquo;s shares closed up modest 1.1% at $237.94 on Friday.</p>\n<p>The approval comes three months earlier than the previously-announced FDA action date of August 15. &ldquo;The earlier approval, and the label, also improves Amgen&rsquo;s competitive position compared to its closest rival, Mirati, by virtue of a widened time-to-market advantage,&rdquo; commented SVB Leering analyst Geoffrey Porges.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mirati Therapeutics (Nasdaq: MRTX) is planning a regulatory filing in the second half of this year after posting preliminary NSCLC data on its KRAS G12C inhibitor adagrasib in October 2020.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sales and pricing forecasts</strong></h2>\n<p>Mr Porges currently forecasts Lumakras reaching revenue of $1.2 billion in the USA and $1.6 billion in worldwide sales in 2025. This compares to consensus of $824 million and $1.2 billion respectively. He also forecasts US peak sales of $1.7 billion (versus consensus of $1.3 billion) and worldwide peak sales of $3.2 billion in 2030 (versus consensus estimate of $2.2 billion). Also, he currently projects a list price for Lumakras of $18,576 per month in the USA and $5,692-$12,198 per month in ex-US markets.</p>\n<p>\"The FDA approval of Lumakras is a breakthrough moment for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer because there is now a targeted therapy for this common, but previously elusive, mutation,\" said Dr David Reese, executive vice president of R&amp;D at Amgen, adding: \"KRAS has challenged cancer researchers for more than 40 years with many deeming it as 'undruggable.' The Lumakras development program was a race against cancer for Amgen's scientists and clinical trial investigators who together have now successfully delivered this new medicine to patients in less than three years - from first patient dosed to US regulatory approval.\"</p>\n<h2><strong>Approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway</strong></h2>\n<p>Lumakras was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is unmet medical need and a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further study is required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Lumakras.</p>\n<p>This review was conducted under <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/project-orbis\">Project Orbis</a>, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amgen has partnered with two companies - Guardant Health and Qiagen - to develop blood- and tissue-based companion diagnostics (CDx), respectively, for Lumakras. With the addition of these tests, patients and clinicians will have more options and flexibility for conducting KRAS&nbsp;G12C biomarker testing.</p>", "date": "2021-05-29 15:43:00", "meta_title": "Amgen scores a first with FDA approval of Lumakras", "meta_keywords": "Amgen, Lumakras, Sotorasib, Cancer, Lung, NSCLC< KRAS G12C, Mutations, FDA, Approval, Undruggable", "meta_description": "Amgen scores a first with FDA approval of Lumakras", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-29 15:42:16", "updated": "2021-05-29 15:52:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-scores-a-first-with-fda-approval-of-lumakras", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "amgen_big.jpg", "image2id": "amgen_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Amgen", "drug_tag": "Lumakras, sotorasib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-29 15:43:00"}
