The application is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AVEO plans to make Fotivda available to kidney cancer patients in the USA by March 31, 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>Already approved in EU and elsewhere</strong></h2>\n<p>Fotivda was approved in August 2017 in the European Union and other countries in the territory of its partner EUSA Pharma for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC. Tivozanib has been shown to significantly reduce regulatory T-cell production in pre-clinical models. Tivozanib was discovered by Japan&rsquo;s Kyowa Kirin (TYO: 4151) and is also being studied as a new formulation by KKC in wet acute macular degeneration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe in Fotivda&rsquo;s potential to provide a differentiated treatment option for the growing number of individuals in the US with relapsed or refractory RCC, and today marks the culmination of many years of hard work and determination of many individuals to bring this therapy to patients,&rdquo; said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive of AVEO. &ldquo;With today&rsquo;s approval, AVEO begins its journey as a commercial-stage company, a noteworthy accomplishment in our industry. On behalf of the entire AVEO team, I would like to thank all the patients, their families, and caregivers whose tireless efforts made this day possible,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Relapsed or refractory RCC is a devastating disease for which patient outcomes can be limited due to the trade-off between tolerability and efficacy,&rdquo; said Dena Battle, president of KCCure, adding: &ldquo;The FDA approval of Fotivda represents an exciting, meaningful advancement by providing a new treatment option for this patient population.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-11 11:06:00", "meta_title": "Long-awaited FDA approval for AVEO Oncology's Fotivda", "meta_keywords": "AVEO Oncology, Fotivda, FDA, Approval, Carcinoma, Renal cell, Cancer, Kidney", "meta_description": "Long-awaited FDA approval for AVEO Oncology's Fotivda", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-11 11:05:44", "updated": "2021-03-11 11:19:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/long-awaited-fda-approval-for-aveo-oncology-s-fotivda", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "aveo_oncology_large.jpg", "image2id": "aveo_oncology_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AVEO Oncology", "drug_tag": "Fotivda", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-11 11:06:00"}
