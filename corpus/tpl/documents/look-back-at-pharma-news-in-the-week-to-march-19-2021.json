Editor</p>\n<p>Among last week&rsquo;s notable research news, Eli Lilly presented updated results on its Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease candidate donanemab which, though touted as promising in a disease area that has been filled with failures, is seen as disappointing by some. Meantime, strong Phase III results saw Sanofi and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals halt their trial of Libtayo in cervical cancer. On the deal-making front, rivals in the HIV space Gilead Sciences and Merck &amp; Co signed a pact last Monday to trial a combination of their respective candidates &ndash; lenacapavir and islatravir. Regulatory news saw AbbVie suffer a setback last Wednesday, when the US Food and Drug Administration extended the review period for its Rinvoq in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis.</p>\n<h2><strong>Lilly&rsquo;s donanemab has much to prove</strong></h2>\n<p>Those with high hopes heading into today&rsquo;s presentation of Eli Lilly&rsquo;s Phase II <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mixed-but-encouraging-results-for-lilly-s-donanemab-in-alzheimer-s\">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study</a> will be disappointed to learn that the primary endpoint was only just met, and that the key secondary measure failed to reach significance, commented Amy Brown on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>True, the trial was technically a success and the data overall seemed to move in the right direction, something that is rarely seen in the Alzheimer&rsquo;s field. But it seems certain that the FDA will want to see results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial, due in 2023, before it reviews the project; any expectations of a swift filing will be snuffed out by these data. (</p>\n<p>Still, Biogen is seeking approval for its similarly acting beta-amyloid MAb, aducanumab, on questionable data and what many believe to be a marginal effect. Should that project be approved in June &ndash; an outcome that is far from assured &ndash; a low bar would be set for donanemab.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is notable how Lilly&rsquo;s bullish claims for the outcome contrast starkly with the much more moderate conclusions of the full paper, said Ms Brown. The authors conclude that donanemab resulted in &ldquo;modestly less cognitive and functional decline than placebo.&rdquo; Slowing disease progression by half, which the trial was powered to show, was not achieved.</p>\n<p>The significance of the hit on the primary endpoint is lessened somewhat by the use of a measure not well known in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease research, iARDS. Lilly had already disclosed that donanemab slowed clinical decline on iARDS by a statistically significant 32% relative to the control arm. Today a 0.04 p value was disclosed, and an absolute benefit of 3.20 points on the scale.</p>\n<p>Amber Tong, writing on EndPoints Weekly, noted that nothing drums up excitement and controversy quite as instantly and intensely as Alzheimer&rsquo;s &mdash; as Eli Lilly has once again demonstrated with the presentation of mixed results &nbsp;&nbsp;from its Phase II trial of donanemab. While the pharma giant heralded a statistically-significant result for the unconventional primary endpoint it chose, even the optimists were cautious to jump to conclusions while critics homed in on the meh numbers on the secondary endpoints (which represented more traditional metrics used in previous studies) and side effects. Lilly, though, maintained the data were &ldquo;tremendously important&rdquo; and is upbeat about its upcoming pivotal before heading to regulators &mdash; by which time they may also have a precedent in Biogen&rsquo;s aducanumab.</p>\n<h2><strong>Libtayo advances with positive Phase III cervical cancer data</strong></h2>\n<p>Regeneron announced positive top-line data for the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/trial-of-libtayo-stopped-early-on-strong-phase-iii-data\">Phase III Libtayo</a> (cemiplimab) monotherapy study in advanced cervical cancer. The trial was stopped early due to positive overall survival (OS) benefit in the Libtayo arm compared to chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>SVB Leering Research analyst Geoffrey Porges believes the results are compelling and should support a regulatory approval for Libtayo in advanced cervical cancer as a monotherapy. Based on the trial design, which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 status, he believes Libtayo could potentially have a broader label versus Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda, which requires PD-L1 testing for tumors that have a combined positive score (CPS) of &ge;1.</p>\n<p>Regeneron anticipates that the data will support regulatory submission in 2021, which if approved would be Libtayo&rsquo;s fourth indication to receive approval behind cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He believes the indication is relatively small, with a 2020 global market of ~$60 million (Keytruda comprising ~$17 million), but expected to grow to $1 billion in 2026 driven by the entrance of new checkpoint inhibitors such as Agenus&rsquo; balstilimab (PD-1) and zalifrelimab (CTLA4). Mr Porges believe Libtayo could be competitive in this emerging indication if the approved label forgoes PD-L1 testing, but ultimately, he expects significant revenue growth to be driven by success from Regeneron&rsquo;s pipeline I/O combination treatments such as the costim-bispecifics.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Lenacapavir and islatravir finally hooking up but not exclusive</strong></h2>\n<p>Gilead Sciences and Merck &amp; Co last week announced they will co-develop Gilead&rsquo;s lenacapavir and Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s islatravir as <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-and-gilead-partner-on-hiv-treatment-combo\">long-acting HIV therapies</a>. Analysts at SVB Leerink Research view the collaboration as ideal from a risk- and capital management perspective, bringing together two assets that seem highly complementary and could meaningfully improve on treatment adherence and disease control. The terms appear to have required significant negotiation and compromise, with Gilead investors likely to be concerned about mid-term cannibalization of Gilead&rsquo;s highly profitable HIV product sales.</p>\n<p>Development costs will be split 60/40 with Gilead taking the larger share of the expenses. Revenue will be split 50/50 up to $2 billion or $3.5 billion (global net product sales) for the LOA and LAI injectable products, respectively. Above those hurdle rates the split becomes 65/35 for Gilead/Merck. Gilead disclosed they believe the oral combination product could reach the market in 2025 at the earliest, with the injectable formulation following in 2027. The first clinical trials of the combinations are expected in second half 2021.</p>\n<p>Merk is also evaluating islatravir with its wholly-owned doravirine (Pifeltro), an approved once-daily non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and MK-8507, a more potent investigational NNRTI intended for once-weekly administration. Islatravir alone is also being developed for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), with a PK profile that supports once-monthly oral administration or protection for a year when delivered as part of a subdermal implant, as suggested by Phase I data recently presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI).</p>\n<p>These product profiles could improve the compliance seen with approved once-daily options for PREP (Truvada, Descovy), and appear more convenient than promising long-acting injectables in development (cabotegravir every eight weeks). The Leerink analysts currently model $1.4 billion in peak sales for islatravir but are reviewing this estimate following recent updates.</p>\n<p>Adding her voice, Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage noted that long-acting HIV therapies are shaping up to be competitive. But Gilead and Merck are calling a truce &ndash; at least in part &ndash; to develop combinations of their respective projects lenacapavir, a capsid inhibitor, and islatravir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The deal also covers an option for either company to license the other&rsquo;s oral integrase inhibitors, which are currently preclinical, for combination. But outside the agreement the groups remain fierce rivals in HIV, the Merck execs stressed.</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA crackdown: JAK Rinvoq PDUFA in PsA extended</strong></h2>\n<p>AbbVie announced that the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-extends-review-period-for-rinvoq\">FDA has extended the target date for Rinvoq</a> in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) after responding to an information request earlier, and AbbVie said that a similar request had been received for Rinvoq&rsquo;s pending application in atopic dermatitis, commented SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>\n<p>He presumes this means that the action date for atopic dermatitis (AD) is extended as well. This is another example of what is clearly a new regulatory approach from the FDA &ndash; every potentially questionable or uncertain approval event seems to be pushed out, or re-evaluated, whereas investors may have had a high degree of confidence in their approval in the prior administration. This is likely to increase the perceived level of risk to the industry&rsquo;s outlook, and add more pressure on what are already discounted multiples compared to the market.</p>\n<p>While two events don&rsquo;t make a trend, three events do start making the case for a tougher posture from the FDA under the new administration, said Mr Porges . However, &ldquo;tougher&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean good drugs won&rsquo;t get approved, and Rinvoq&rsquo;s strong efficacy data and tolerable safety profile support approval, in his view, even if AbbVie has to weather a three-month delay before a decision. This regulatory dynamic may have read-through to any drugs with target action dates in the first half of 2021, with potentially more review delays likely until the industry and investors become accustomed to the standards and practices of regulatory reviews in the new administration.</p>\n<p>Also commenting, Lisa Urquhart on Evaluate Vantage noted that Rinvoq has long been touted as one of AbbVie&rsquo;s get-out-of-jail-free cards once biosimilar competition to the group's bestseller, Humira, hits in 2023. However, Rinvoq&rsquo;s saviour status depends on the JAK inhibitor&rsquo;s ability to extend its approved indications beyond rheumatoid arthritis. So, news that the US FDA is extending Rinvoq&rsquo;s review in psoriatic arthritis by three months, and also has questions about another label extension into atopic dermatitis, did not play well; AbbVie shares slumped 6% in morning trading.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AbbVie had been hoping to challenge the market leader, Sanofi&rsquo;s Dupixent, in atopic dermatitis, and the signs had looked good, with Rinvoq comprehensively beating Dupixent head-to-head last year. But success was tempered by toxicity issues and one reported death. While there are arguments that Rinvoq is one of the safest JAK inhibitors on the market, the class as whole has been dogged by safety concerns, and <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/snippets/what-could-xeljanzs-new-safety-scare-cost-jak-inhibitors\">a recent scare from Xeljanz</a> could have prompted more caution from the regulator, Ms Urquhart noted.</p>", "date": "2021-03-21 11:25:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 19, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Eli Lilly, Donanemab, Regeneron, Sanofi, Libtayo, Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co, Lenacapavir, Islatravir, AbbVie, Rinvoq", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 19, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-21 11:23:54", "updated": "2021-03-21 11:38:59", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-19-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Anti-virals, CNS Diseases, Neurological, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "donanemab, islatravir, lenacapavir, Libtayo, Rinvoq", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-21 11:25:00"}
