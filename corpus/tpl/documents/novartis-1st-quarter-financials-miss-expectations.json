{"contentid": 488466, "importid": NaN, "name": "Novartis 1st-quarter financials miss expectations", "introduction": "Swiss pharma giant Novartis today released first-quarter 2021 financial results, which failed to meet analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations.", "content": "<p>Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) today released first-quarter 2021 financial results, which failed to meet analysts&rsquo; expectations.</p>\n<p>Net sales were $12.4 billion (+1%, -2% constant currency) in the first quarter driven by volume growth of 3 percentage points, price erosion of 2 percentage points and negative impact from generic competition of 3 percentage points. This compared to $12.5 billion forecast in the Refinitiv poll. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, Novartis estimates first quarter net sales grew 1% (cc, +4% USD).</p>\n<p>Core net income was $3.4 billion (-4%, -6% cc) mainly driven by the decline in core operating income, compared to the $3.5 billion average estimates of nine analysts in a poll by Refinitiv. Core EPS was $1.52 (-3%, -5% cc), declining less than core net income, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.</p>\n<p>Novartis confirmed its full-year 2021 outlook, which project net sales growing at a low- to mid-single-digit percentage rate, with core operating income expected to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate, ahead of sales.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the quarter, Vas Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, said: <em>&ldquo;</em>Novartis growth drivers and launches continued their strong momentum with double-digit growth for Entresto, Cosentyx, Oncology growth drivers and Zolgensma. We expect Sandoz performance to stabilize, in the near-term, after a challenging quarter. Our broad pipeline of novel medicines continued to progress, with the US approval of Entresto across the full spectrum of chronic heart failure and the positive readout for our radioligand therapy in prostate cancer. Our progress on building trust with society has been recognized by top rankings on the Access to Medicines Index and Sustainalytics. We remain confident in progressing our leading pipeline and delivering our growth outlook.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Segment and product performances</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Innovative Medicine</strong> net sales were $10.1 billion (+4%, 0% cc) with volume contributing 4 percentage points. Generic competition had a negative impact of 4 percentage points.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandoz </strong>net sales were $2.3 billion (-9%, -13% cc) with a negative price effect of 10 percentage points mainly due to increasing competition and prior year benefit from off-contract sales. Volume declined 3 percentage points from the impact of COVID-19 on prior year forward purchasing and softened retail demand, with a historically weak cough and cold season, partly offset by growth in Biopharmaceuticals. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, we estimate first quarter net sales declined -9% (cc, -5% USD).</p>\n<p>Sales of Entresto (sacubitril and valsartan) were $789 million (+34% cc) with sustained strong growth and increased patient share across markets, driven by demand as the essential first choice therapy for heart failure patients.</p>\n<p>Sales of Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) were $319 million (+81% cc) with a strong quarter and growth driven by Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, as well as ongoing geographic expansion.</p>\n<p>Sales of Cosentyx (secukinumab) were $1.1 billion (+11% cc) and saw continued growth across indications despite access changes in the US and COVID-19 negatively impacting new patient starts.</p>\n<p>Sales of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) at $151 million (+55% cc) grew strongly across all regions. Coverage continued to expand, with more than 300 qualified treatment centers in 28 countries.</p>\n<p>Sales of Promacta/Revolade (eltrombopag) at $463 million (+13% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line for severe aplastic anemia in the USA.</p>", "date": "2021-04-27 12:00:00", "meta_title": "Novartis 1st-quarter financials miss expectations", "meta_keywords": "Novartis, 1st-quarter, 2021, Financial results, Sandoz, Entresto, Zolgensma, Cosentyx", "meta_description": "Novartis 1st-quarter financials miss expectations", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-27 11:59:22", "updated": "2021-04-27 12:08:59", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-1st-quarter-financials-miss-expectations", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "2020_novartis_big.jpg", "image2id": "2020_novartis_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, Cell and Gene Therapy, Inflammatory diseases, Oncology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Financial", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Novartis, Sandoz", "drug_tag": "Cosentyx, Entresto, Kymriah, Promacta, Zolgensma", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-27 12:00:00"}
