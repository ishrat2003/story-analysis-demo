It has over 10 novel drugs in clinical studies at various stages in the USA, European Union and Australia, including a combo of camrelizumab (PD1 antibody) and apatinib for hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA in Phase III studies.</p>\n<p>Differentiation, he said, plays an important role to have a successful trial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He gave pyrotinib as an example. Developed by Hengrui, the asset is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2. In China, it was approved in 2018 to treat HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. In the USA, however, it is under Phase III studies as a therapy for advanced non-squamous NSCLC with HER2 mutations.</p>\n<p>Swiss pharma giant Roche (ROG: SIX subsidiary &ldquo;Genentech is really strong in breast cancer treatments, so it&rsquo;s wise for us to choose another indication that has unmet medical needs in the US. This is called differentiation,&rdquo; Dr Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Lu Xianping from Chipscreen Biosciences, a Shenzhen-based biotech, going global does not necessarily mean a US launch. He chose Japan as the first overseas market for the company&rsquo;s proprietary T cell lymphoma treatment Epidaza (chidamide). In Japan, the asset is under review for the same indication, and Dr Lu expects an approval this year. The Japan choice is mainly about the cost.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The FDA required evaluations on cardiovascular risks among over 10,000 study participants. It was too costly for us,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Dr Lu agreed with Hengrui&rsquo;s Dr Zhang that Food and Drug Administration authorities usually welcome novel assets that would address urgent clinical needs. This can be said to Chipscreen&rsquo;s serine-threonine kinase inhibitor chiauranib, which recently gained the FDA&rsquo;s approval to do studies in the USA. The asset employs a new mechanism to slow down the progression of SCLC.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;FDA authorities are interested because few novel drugs are available to slow down the fast developing cancer,&rdquo; he added. In China, the asset is exploring combo therapies targeting a blaster of cancers, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer and neuroendocrine tumor.</p>\n<p>For the China market, local companies will continue to pump out innovative drugs through licensing deals. Chipscreen is looking for early-stage assets that ideally could pair with its own treatments to make combo therapies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to treat tumors with just one drug. We are actively looking for good combo solutions,&rdquo; Dr Lu said.</p>\n<p>For Hengrui, Dr Zhang said he is interested in assets targeting blood cancers as well as infectious diseases to complement Hengrui&rsquo;s pipeline.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Assets with great data from Phase II studies are usually in our interest. We prefer in-licensing an asset that can get into the Phase III studies in China right away,&rdquo; Dr Zhang said.</p>\n<h2><strong>MNCs also looking to partnerships</strong></h2>\n<p>Both Chinese pharmas and MNCs are looking into partnerships to speed up the R&amp;D process. Roche, for example, is looking for early-stage assets and start-ups specialized in diagnostics, said Harm-Jan Borgeld, global head of Asia partnering at Roche.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are not only looking for global innovations, but also local innovations in China,&rdquo; he said. Dr Borgeld added that, while his team would love see an asset offering impressive data from Phase II studies, but it is difficult to find.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So we are ok with early stage assets. They can be small molecules, large molecules, immunology and neurology. If you have an asset targeting Alzheimer&rsquo;s, talk to me immediately because we know how huge the unmet medical need is,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>May Wang, senior vice president for business development at the Shanghai-based biotech Hutchmed, echoed Chipscreen&rsquo;s Dr Lu&rsquo;s thoughts on combo therapies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Combo therapies is the future. We want to partner with companies with whom we can do development together,&rdquo; she said.</p>", "date": "2021-04-28 17:07:00", "meta_title": "Differentiation and partnership key to Chinese companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 global strat", "meta_keywords": "DJSeedin conference, Partnerships,  Differentiatiom.
