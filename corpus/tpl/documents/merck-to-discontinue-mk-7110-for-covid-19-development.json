Based on the additional research that would be required &ndash; new clinical trials as well as research related to manufacturing at scale &ndash; MK-7110 would not be expected to become available until the first half of 2022.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will now focus on advancing molnupiravir</strong></h2>\n<p>Given this timeline and these technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties, the availability of a number of medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the need to concentrate Merck&rsquo;s resources on accelerating the development and manufacture of the most viable therapeutics and vaccines, Merck has determined to discontinue development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and to focus its pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Merck&rsquo;s commitment from the outset of the pandemic has been to deploy our expertise and capabilities where they can have the most impact,&rdquo; said Dr Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. &ldquo;Merck is now focusing its efforts on advancing molnupiravir, which, as an oral medicine for outpatient use, represents a promising potential new approach, and on accelerating production of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Second covid disappointment</strong></h2>\n<p>Merck was a relatively late starter into the novel coronavirus scene, and this is the second disappointment for the company.</p>\n<p>In January, Merck announced that it is <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-drops-two-covid-19-vaccine-candidates\">discontinuing development</a> of its SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine candidates, V590 and V591, and plans to focus its SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 research strategy and production capabilities on advancing two therapeutic candidates, MK-4482 and MK-7110.</p>\n<p>The vaccine candidates were acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience, and V590, developed with non-profit research organization IAVI.</p>\n<p>This decision followed Merck&rsquo;s review of findings from Phase I clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 14:32:00", "meta_title": "Merck to discontinue MK-7110 for COVID-19 development", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, MK-7110, COVID-19, Development, Discontinued, OncoImmune", "meta_description": "Merck to discontinue MK-7110 for COVID-19 development", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 14:30:50", "updated": "2021-04-15 14:39:00", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-to-discontinue-mk-7110-for-covid-19-development", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "merck_co_large.png", "image2id": "merck_co_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co, OncoImmune", "drug_tag": "MK-7110", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 14:32:00"}
