The data&nbsp;will form the basis of regulatory submissions in 2021.</p>\n<p>\"In this Phase III trial, Libtayo demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival in women with advanced cervical cancer after progression on chemotherapy, reducing the risk of death by 31% compared to chemotherapy in the overall population,\" said Dr Krishnansu Tewari, Professor and Director of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of California, Irvine and a trial investigator.</p>\n<p>\"Improvements in progression-free survival and objective response rate were also demonstrated in the overall population compared to chemotherapy. Taken together, this landmark trial &ndash; which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 expression status &ndash; helps support the use of Libtayo as a potential new second-line treatment for women with advanced cervical cancer who face a poor prognosis and limited treatment options,\" he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Study findings</strong></h2>\n<p>In the overall population, those treated with Libtayo (n=304) experienced significant improvements in OS, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), compared to chemotherapy (n=304), including a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>31% reduction in the risk of death(hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.84; one-sided p=0.00011).</li>\n<li>25% reduction in the risk of disease progression(HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.63-0.89; one-sided p=0.00048).</li>\n<li>16% ORR(50 patients; 95% CI: 13-21%; one-sided p=0.00004), compared to 6% with chemotherapy (19 patients). Median duration of response was 16 months with Libtayo (95% CI: 12 months to not yet evaluable) and 7 months with chemotherapy (95% CI: 5-8 months), per Kaplan-Meier estimates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the USA, Libtayo is approved for certain patients with advanced stages of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with &ge;50% PD-L1 expression. Outside of the USA, Libtayo is approved for certain patients with advanced CSCC in the European Union and six other countries, including Australia, Brazil, the UK and Canada.</p>\n<p>Global Libtayo sales were $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, (+30% y/y, +1% q/q), missing consensus by 12%.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-13 10:35:00", "meta_title": "Positive Libtayo Phase III data in advanced cervical cancer", "meta_keywords": "Regeneron, Sanofi, Libtayo, Phase III, Cancer, Cervical, ESMO", "meta_description": "Positive Libtayo Phase III data in advanced cervical cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-13 10:33:54", "updated": "2021-05-13 10:40:46", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-libtayo-phase-iii-data-in-advanced-cervical-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sanofi-regeneron-big.jpg", "image2id": "sanofi-regeneron-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Conferences, Drug Trial, ESMO, Research", "geography_tag": "France, USA", "company_tag": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "Libtayo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-13 10:35:00"}
