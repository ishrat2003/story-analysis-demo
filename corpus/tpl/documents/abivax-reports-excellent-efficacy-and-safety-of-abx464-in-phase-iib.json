Importantly, the overall drop-out rate of patients in the study was only 9%, which is remarkable in view of the Covid-19 situation.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, after 48 weeks of open-label maintenance treatment with ABX464, preliminary data from the first 51 patients showed further increased and durable clinical and endoscopic efficacy.</p>\n<p>The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase IIb induction study was conducted at 130 study sites in 15 European countries, Canada and the US. It had three once-daily oral ABX464 treatment groups (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) and one placebo group. 254 patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis were enrolled into the trial. 50% of these patients had inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;) inhibitors, vedolizumab, other biologics and/or JAK inhibitors treatments while the other 50% were refractory to conventional treatments.</p>\n<h2><strong>Potential to become a gamechanger</strong></h2>\n<p>Abivax chief executive Professor Hartmut Ehrlich commented: &ldquo;The Phase IIb results demonstrate the potential of ABX464 to become a gamechanger for the treatment of ulcerative colitis patients in need of new therapeutic management options. Interestingly, the lowest dose of 25mg was effective across the entire study population, including patients refractory to biologics and JAK inhibitors, with a safety profile that is very similar to the placebo group. Based on these data, we are now moving forward as quickly as possible with our Phase III plan in ulcerative colitis as well as phase IIb/III in Crohn&rsquo;s disease to bring ABX464 to the many patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-26 15:28:00", "meta_title": "Abivax reports excellent efficacy and safety of ABX464 in Phase IIb", "meta_keywords": "Abivax, ABX464, Phase IIb, Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease", "meta_description": "Abivax reports excellent efficacy and safety of ABX464 in Phase IIb", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-26 15:23:05", "updated": "2021-05-26 15:31:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abivax-reports-excellent-efficacy-and-safety-of-abx464-in-phase-iib", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "abivax-big.jpg", "image2id": "abivax-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Gastroenterology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "France", "company_tag": "Abivax", "drug_tag": "ABX464", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-26 15:28:00"}
