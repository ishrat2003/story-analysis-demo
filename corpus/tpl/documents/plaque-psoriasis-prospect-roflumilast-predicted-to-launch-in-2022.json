In fact, 90% of patients within the randomized roflumilast treatment arm completed a full eight weeks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;However, while such a favorable safety and efficacy profile is promising, the drug may still face logistical hurdles establishing itself in the crowded PsO disease space. If approved in PsO, roflumilast would be the second PDE4 inhibitor to market, following Amgen&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: AMGN) Otezla (apremilast), which is set to lose patent protection in 2028.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;GlobalData anticipates that roflumilast will launch in 2022 across the seven major markets.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Unlike Otezla, roflumilast is a topical cream. The current standard topical therapies for PsO are corticosteroids, a class that has not seen innovations since the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Arcutis will likely position roflumilast as a first-line therapy, prior to the use of injectable biologics. The addition of a new topical product would likely be an easy transition for mild and moderate patients who are already accustomed to using topical corticosteroids.</p>\n<p>Ms Chan added: &ldquo;However, roflumilast is entering an increasingly crowded and competitive field with numerous existing branded agents, as well as several generics and biosimilars set to launch in the next decade.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Roflumilast would be Arcutis&rsquo; first agent to market and will compete with agents coming from pharmaceutical stalwarts such as AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - companies that are already well established in the PsO market with prescribers and payers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Therefore, additional post-marketing active comparator trials may prove to be essential for Arcutis to further inform physician prescribing patterns and establish Arcutis&rsquo; reputation in the field.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 16:47:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "roflumilast, Arcutis, psoriasis, plaque, GlobalData, topical, Johnson, data, launch, market, prospect, predicted, supporting, agents, NYSE, DERMIS-, agent", "meta_description": "GlobalData has taken a look at the data supporting roflumilast for plaque psoriasis (PsO).", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 15:16:19", "updated": "2021-05-21 16:47:23", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/plaque-psoriasis-prospect-roflumilast-predicted-to-launch-in-2022", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "arcutis_large.png", "image2id": "arcutis_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Dermatologicals, Inflammatory diseases", "topic_tag": "Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Arcutis Biotherapeutics", "drug_tag": "roflumilast", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 16:47:00"}
