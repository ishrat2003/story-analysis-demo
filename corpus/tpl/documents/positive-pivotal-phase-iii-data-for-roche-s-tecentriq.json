In this population, Tecentriq increased DFS by a median of seven months (42.3 months versus 35.3 months with BSC). Safety data for Tecentriq were consistent with its known safety profile and no new safety signals were identified.</p>\n<h2><strong>Results lay the groundwork for a new approach to treatment</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;These landmark Phase III data demonstrate for the first time that cancer immunotherapy can bring a clinically-meaningful improvement to certain people with early lung cancer in the adjuvant setting,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche&rsquo;s chief medical officer and head of global Product Development. &ldquo;These results lay the groundwork for a new approach to the treatment of early-stage lung cancer and bring us closer to our goal of providing an effective and tailored treatment option for every person diagnosed with this disease,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>The goal of adjuvant therapy is to lower the risk of recurrence and provide the best opportunity for a cure. Still, about half of all patients with Stage I-III NSCLC eventually develop disease recurrence following curative-intent treatment. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is the current standard of care for patients with completely resected early-stage NSCLC (Stage IB-IIIA) who are at a high-risk of disease recurrence or relapse. This treatment provides a modest 4&ndash;5% improvement in five-year survival compared with observation.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>Follow-up will continue with planned analyses of DFS in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population, including Stage IB patients, which at the time of analysis did not cross the threshold, and overall survival (OS) data, which were immature at the time of interim analysis. In the overall randomized population of study participants, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 92.7% of people receiving Tecentriq, compared with 70.7% of those receiving BSC. Grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 21.8% of people treated with Tecentriq&nbsp;compared with 11.5% in the BSC group; 0.8% of people in the Tecentriq group experienced a Grade 5 AE. As anticipated, the addition of up to one year of Tecentriq&nbsp;following chemotherapy led to a higher number of AEs compared with BSC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-20 10:32:00", "meta_title": "Positive pivotal Phase III data for Roche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tecentriq", "meta_keywords": "Roche, Tecentriq, Phase III, Cancer, Lung, NSCLC, Survival, Recurrence", "meta_description": "Positive pivotal Phase III data for Roche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tecentriq", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-20 10:30:15", "updated": "2021-05-20 10:36:34", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-pivotal-phase-iii-data-for-roche-s-tecentriq", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tecentriq_big.png", "image2id": "tecentriq_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Roche", "drug_tag": "Tecentriq", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-20 10:32:00"}
