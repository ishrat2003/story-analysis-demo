The review of both applications will also be conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.</p>\n<p>The FDA&rsquo;s RTOR program aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international partners.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The first sBLA is based on the Phase III EV-301 trial and seeks to convert PADCEV&rsquo;s accelerated approval to regular approval. The second sBLA, based on the pivotal trial EV-201&rsquo;s cohort 2, requests an expansion of the current indication to include patients with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and are ineligible for cisplatin. Results from EV-301 were published in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035807\"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></a>. Results from EV-301 and EV-201 cohort 2 were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With our recent regulatory submissions, we intend to provide the highest level of clinical evidence supporting Padcev use &ndash; overall survival data from a randomized Phase III trial &ndash; and expand availability in multiple countries where there is unmet medical need,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Krivoshik, senior vice president and oncology therapeutic area head, Astellas.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These FDA filings, along with regulatory submissions outside of the United States under our collaboration with Astellas, are important steps in our shared goal of bringing Padecev to more patients with advanced urothelial cancer,&rdquo; added Dr Roger Dansey, chief medical officer of Seagen.</p>\n<p>Health authorities in Australia and Canada will evaluate data from EV-301 and EV-201 for initial registrations under the Project Orbis scheme. Last month, Astellas filed for Japanese approval of Padcev.</p>\n<h2><strong>Market prospects</strong></h2>\n<p>The bladder cancer therapeutics market was valued at $670 million in 2018 across the seven major markets (7MM: USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan) and is expected to grow exponentially at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6% - accruing slightly less than $5.6 billion in 2028, according to analytics firm GlobalData.</p>\n<p>Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData believe that therapies such as Padcev, and its combination with Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab), sacituzumab govitecan, and bempegaldesleukin in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo (nivolumab), carry tremendous potential to benefit muscle invasive, locally-advanced and metastatic bladder cancer patients.</p>", "date": "2021-04-20 15:43:00", "meta_title": "FDA accepts two priority review sBLAs for Padcev", "meta_keywords": "Astellas, Seagen, Padcev, sBLA, Priority review, Regular approval, Cancer, Urothelial, Bladder", "meta_description": "FDA accepts two priority review sBLAs for Padcev", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-20 15:42:22", "updated": "2021-04-20 15:50:18", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-two-priority-review-sblas-for-padcev", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "seagen_large.jpg", "image2id": "seagen_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Astellas, Seagen", "drug_tag": "Padcev", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-20 15:43:00"}
