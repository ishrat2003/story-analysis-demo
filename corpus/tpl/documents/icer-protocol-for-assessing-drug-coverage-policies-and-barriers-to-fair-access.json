For each formulary, the ICER will examine tiering, step therapy requirements, and elements of the prior authorization criteria for 28 specific drugs &ndash; all of which ICER has previously found to be priced fairly at a cost-effective level &ndash; to determine if coverage policies are in concordance with criteria for fair patient access.</p>\n<p>The ICER anticipates publishing its first annual assessment of Barriers to Fair Access on October 20, 2021.
