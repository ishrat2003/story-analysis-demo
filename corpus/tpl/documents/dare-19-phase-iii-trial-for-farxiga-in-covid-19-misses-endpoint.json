The study was conducted in partnership with Saint Luke&rsquo;s Mid America Heart Institute.</p>\n<p>DARE-19 was the first Phase III trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who also have risk factors for developing serious complications, including hypertension (HTN), type-2 diabetes (T2D), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 3-4. Cardiac, renal and metabolic co-morbidities have been associated with poor outcomes and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>\n<h2><strong>Also trialing AZD7442</strong></h2>\n<p>AstraZeneca is also trialing AZD7442, a long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination which is in late-stage development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The company last month signed a deal with the US government to supply up to <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astrazeneca-inks-new-205-million-deal-with-us-govt-for-covid-19-antibody-azd7442\">500,000 additional doses of AZD7442</a>, worth $205 million.</p>\n<p>Dr Mikhail Kosiborod, cardiologist at Saint Luke&rsquo;s Mid America Heart Institute, vice president of research at Saint Luke's Health System, and principal investigator of DARE-19, said: &ldquo;DARE-19 provided important data on the potential benefits and risks of using SGLT2 inhibitors to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While the trial did not achieve statistical significance, the findings are very interesting and valuable, and will inform future clinical science. Also, of importance, we learned that dapagliflozin&rsquo;s well-established safety profile was consistent in DARE-19.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mene Pangalos, executive VP, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;Prior to the DARE-19 Phase III trial, there was little data on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and we have now helped to fill this knowledge gap. We look forward to the efficacy and safety data being presented in the coming weeks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The safety and tolerability profile for Farxiga at 30 days in the trial was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine, the drugmaker noted.</p>", "date": "2021-04-12 11:35:00", "meta_title": "DARE-19 Phase III trial for Farxiga in COVID-19 misses endpoint", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, DARE-19, Phase III, Farxiga, COVID-19, Hospitalized patients", "meta_description": "DARE-19 Phase III trial for Farxiga in COVID-19 misses endpoint", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-12 11:35:05", "updated": "2021-04-12 11:45:53", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/dare-19-phase-iii-trial-for-farxiga-in-covid-19-misses-endpoint", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca_lab_large.png", "image2id": "astrazeneca_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Farxiga", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-12 11:35:00"}
