Today&rsquo;s approval of dostarlimab means that for the first time in Europe, these women will have access to a new, innovative and much-needed therapy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr Ana Oaknin, head of the gynecologic cancer program at Vall d&rsquo;Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Vall d&rsquo;Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, and primary investigator for the GARNET Trial, said: &ldquo;As we saw in the pivotal GARNET trial that supported this approval, treatment with dostarlimab has the potential to provide clinically significant and durable responses in patients who formerly had few treatment options. This approval represents a step forward, providing a new treatment for women with recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer who have previously failed a platinum-based chemotherapy.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Sales forecast</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Evaluate Pharma</em> sell-side consensus sees Jemperli revenues rising from an anemic $37 million this year to $546 million in 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Originally developed by USA-based AnaptysBio (Nasdaq: ANAB), the therapy was licensed to fellow American firm Tesaro in 2014, under the terms of a strategic immuno-oncology collaboration.
