Safety was consistent with previous studies of Tyvyt.</p>\n<p>Yuankai Shi, principal investigator of ORIENT-3, associate dean of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Chairman of Cancer Foundation of China, said: \"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally, of which NSCLC accounts for 80 to 85%.</p>\n<p>\"In the past few decades, drug development of NSCLC has mainly focused on non-squamous NSCLC, while drug development of sqNSCLC has been slower due to its unique epidemiological, histopathological and molecular characteristics. In China, specifically, the approved options for second-line immunotherapy to treat sqNSCLC are even more limited. The ORIENT-3 study showed that the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody sintilimab significantly improved OS for the second-line treatment of sqNSCLC patients, which is of great clinical value. We hope that the positive results of ORIENT-3 can help more sqNSCLC patients.\"</p>\n<p>Tyvyt is being jointly developed in China by Innovent and Lilly.</p>\n<p>Hui Zhou, vice president of medical science and strategy oncology at Innovent, said: &ldquo;Tyvyt was the first anti-PD-1 inhibitor included in the New Catalogue of the National Reimbursement Drug List in 2019.</p>\n<p>\"In August 2020, the National Medical Products Administration accepted a new indication application for Tyvyt in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of sqNSCLC. In the ORIENT-3 study, sintilimab as second-line monotherapy demonstrated a significantly improved survival benefit for patients with advanced sqNSCLC, and we look forward to the potential approval of this indication, to help more patients with this type of lung cancer.\"</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 16:42:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-13 16:13:11", "updated": "2021-04-13 16:47:45", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/innovent-and-lilly-s-tyvyt-meets-endpoint-in-phase-iii-lung-cancer-trial", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "innovent_large.jpg", "image2id": "innovent_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, Innovent Biologics", "drug_tag": "Tyvyt", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 16:42:00"}
