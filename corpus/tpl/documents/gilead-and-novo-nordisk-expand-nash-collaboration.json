The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that all regimens were well tolerated over 24 weeks.</p>\n<p>Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of development at Novo Nordisk, said: &ldquo;NASH is a disease with a high unmet medical need, as no drugs are currently approved to treat this potentially life-threatening condition. Building on the positive results from our proof-of-concept trial, we hope together with Gilead to demonstrate the potential for semaglutide with cilofexor and firsocostat to help people living with NASH.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mark Genovese, senior vice president, inflammation clinical development at Gilead, added: &ldquo;Gilead is pleased to expand our collaboration with Novo Nordisk and advance understanding of the potential for combination approaches in treating people living with cirrhosis due to NASH.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This study is the latest example of our persistent focus on driving innovation to improve the lives of people living with liver diseases and fibrosis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cilofexor and firsocostat are investigational compounds and have not received approval from the US Food &amp; Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority. Semaglutide has not been approved in NASH but has been for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 16:06:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "NASH, Novo, Gilead, Nordisk, collaboration, study, people, clinical, combination, diabetes, firsocostat, cilofexor, semaglutide, expand, expanded, announce", "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 16:03:24", "updated": "2021-03-18 17:54:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gilead-and-novo-nordisk-expand-nash-collaboration", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novo_nordisk_2021_hq.jpg", "image2id": "novo_nordisk_2021_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Inflammatory diseases, Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Research", "geography_tag": "Denmark, USA", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Novo Nordisk", "drug_tag": "cilofexor, firsocostat, semaglutide", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 16:06:00"}
