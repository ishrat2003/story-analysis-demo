And a glance at the group&rsquo;s pipeline shows little else to get excited about.</p>\n<p>Avacopan&rsquo;s chances in hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy look like a long shot after mid-stage failures last year; ChemoCentryx also has plans in lupus, historically a graveyard for biopharma. And any future successes might be tempered by concerns raised by the FDA about avacopan&rsquo;s liver toxicity. So what next for ChemoCentryx? The company did not mention its Phase 1 asset CCX507 in its latest earnings release, focusing instead on the pre-clinical oral checkpoint inhibitor CCX559; however, others like <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/analysis/vantage-point-going-small-hit-it-big\">Curis have been working on oral projects for some time now</a>&nbsp;with little progress.</p>\n<p>Adding commentary, an analyst at Avisol Capital Partners said that the critical FDA briefing doc, tells him that a CRL (complete response letter) is likely because the FDA has no reason to go against its own briefing document and break the tie.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I got lucky with ChemoCentryx in that I didn&rsquo;t like the high valuation and decided not to invest. Had I invested in CCXI when I wrote my previous article, I would be sitting on an 80% loss as of now after its sordid performance at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting last week.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I got lucky because of another rule I follow. If a company&rsquo;s insider trading data However, we must understand that the study does not reflect what the FDA briefing document originally said - which is the original FDA internal opinion. There is no statistic to show whether in those instances when the FDA and the adcom differed, whether the adcom differed with the briefing docs as well.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That means, if the adcom agrees with the briefing doc that there is a problem with the drug, the FDA is not going to disagree with the adcom about its own briefing doc. In general, the FDA, naturally, is more restrictive than the adcom as studies have shown. This analysis him that the CCXI situation is hopeless, and the drug will receive a CRL.</p>\n<h2><strong>COVID-19 vaccine leaders make hay while Novavax flounders</strong></h2>\n<p>According to Jacob Plieth writing on Evaluate Vantage, Novavax&rsquo; fairy-tale journey from biotech basket case to serious <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/third-quarter-submission-now-looks-likely-for-novavax-vaccine\">COVID-19 vaccine contender has hit problems</a>. Investors are still awaiting US Phase III data that some had expected in March, and to this issue Novavax has now added a manufacturing delay.</p>\n<p>The stock slid 9% on May 11and another 20% the following morning as the group said production capacity for the recombinant nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 would miss its earlier target by up to six months. It would be ironic if a vaccine seen as having huge scientific promise ended up missing its window of opportunity.</p>\n<p>This is precisely the scenario with which Novavax is now coming to terms, at least in the west, where vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson have made huge progress in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing deaths and incidence, and allowing lockdowns to start being eased.</p>\n<p>Novavax now says US, Europe and UK filings will be delayed to the third quarter, arguing that despite the setbacks it can see &ldquo;light at the end of the tunnel.&rdquo; But it gets worse. Not only will clinical data delays set back filing and approval, whenever NVX-CoV2373 is eventually launched its rollout will be slower than had been expected owing to a shortage of raw materials.</p>\n<p>In January, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-novavax-idUSKBN29Y2WP\">Novavax had told Reuters</a> that it would be producing up to 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses monthly by May or June. Last Monday it revealed that the end of the third quarter would see capacity of only 100 million doses a month reached, with 150 million a month not hit until the fourth quarter. At least Novavax has already pre-sold around 109 million NVX-CoV2373 doses to US Operation Warp Speed, and the $1.7 billion or this is money in the bank, said Mr Plieth.</p>\n<p>Blogger Shock Exchange on Seeking Alpha noted that Novavax has never brought a vaccine to market and doubts may grow among the investment community. CVAC expects regulatory approval for its vaccine within weeks. This could create another serious competitor, in addition to Moderna and Pfizer. Uncertainty over emergency use authorization (EUA_ and future revenue remain.</p>\n<p>Novavax has been able to garner noticeable vaccine supply contracts. In February the company signed a deal with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to provide 1.1 billion doses of its vaccine to the COVAX facility. It has also signed supply deals with Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These arrangements appear to be great public relations. Novavax may not be able to fulfill these agreements until it receives EUA for its vaccine.</p>\n<p>Novavax has completed the enrollment of the pivotal Phase III trials in the USA and Mexico, and the final analysis is expected to be reported in second-quarter 2021, the company said.</p>\n<h2><strong>Curis renaissance continues</strong></h2>\n<p>In December six patient&rsquo; worth of data boosted Curis&rsquo; stock more than fivefold, noted Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage. Last Wednesday, results in another three patients added 66% to the company&rsquo;s market cap and raised hopes that the group could have a viable project in the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/curis-rockets-on-release-of-data-for-ca-4948-in-aml-and-mds\">oral Irak-4 inhibitor CA-4948</a>.</p>\n<p>But it is early days for the asset and Curis still has a lot to do. The data, detailed in an EHA abstract, come from a Phase I/II study in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: in nine evaluable subjects, there were two complete responses and two bone marrow complete responses.</p>\n<p>Curis executives said during a conference call yesterday that they had been on the lookout for rhabdomyolysis after seeing it previously in a study in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at a 400mg twice-daily dose. They do not appear to believe that this is a problem with the lower doses in AML/MDS.</p>\n<p>The company now has to figure out which dose to take into Phase II, with the executives saying that all three &ldquo;look therapeutic.&rdquo; When asked, they would not give details on which dose or doses&nbsp;led to the CRs, saying this information would be presented at EHA.</p>\n<p>Curis, whose market cap now sits at nearly $1.5bn, has a lot riding on CA-4948. Its next most advanced asset is the anti-Vista monoclonal antibody CI-8993, on which phase 1 data is due in the second half of the year. Two further clinical-stage assets are on ice after earlier disappointments. Still, the group is way ahead in the Irak-4 space in oncology. Plenty of others are looking at the mechanism, but in autoimmune diseases, said Ms Armstrong.</p>\n<h2><strong>BIIB112 missed in XLPR</strong></h2>\n<p>Biogen reported a negative readout from <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/disappointing-results-from-biogen-s-gene-therapy-study-for-xlrp\">Phase II/III XIRIUS study</a> of cotoretigene toliparvovec (BIIB112), a gene therapy for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), commented SVB Leering Research analyst Marc Goodman.</p>\n<p>This is clearly disappointing news, but this product has not been a focus for investors, so we wouldn&rsquo;t expect much of a meaningful move in the stock. Also, it was never clear to Leerink how significant this program would have been commercially given that a few other companies have also been pursuing this orphan opportunity. Mr Goodman also does not include any sales for this product in his model or any value for this program in our SOTP valuation, so he is making no changes to his earnings forecasts or price target based on this news. Additionally, since the company is not providing much details on the data yet, it&rsquo;s difficult to know if this negative trial has any read-through to the acquired Nightstar Therapeutics (acquired about two years ago) technology more broadly. We maintain our Outperform rating.</p>\n<p>Biogen continues to evaluate the XIRIUS data before communicating potential next steps, and it plans to present detailed data at a future scientific meeting. It also highlighted the company&rsquo;s other ophthalmology programs, including BIIB111 in choroideremia, as well as its collaboration with ViGeneron GmbH, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, and Catalyst Biosciences.</p>\n<p>Adding their voices, Amy Brown and Joanne Fagg writing on Evaluate Vantage pointed out that Biogen paid almost $1 billion two years ago for Nightstar, for two clinical-stage gene therapies for rare eye diseases that cause blindness. One of the two, BIIB112 for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, looks to be going nowhere. The XIRIUS study failed its primary endpoint, which measured vision improvements via a technique called MAIA microperimetry, Biogen said today. Positive trends were observed across several clinically relevant prespecified secondary endpoints, it added, saying the future of the programme had yet to decided. With nothing available to treat this genetic condition, which typically causes blindness at 40, and no safety concerns with BIIB112, there are perhaps motivations for a resurrection. However, investors with long memories will recall previous concerns about lack of efficacy with the project.</p>\n<p>Also commenting, Ned Pagliarulo on BioPharma Dive said Biogen's acquisition of Nightstar signaled the biotech company's commitment to gene therapy research, an investment it's expanded upon with subsequent deals like a <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-vigeneron-gene-therapy-eye-diseases/592919/\">January collaboration with Germany's ViGeneron</a> and another <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-forking-out-1-3-billion-on-aav-capsids-deal\">earlier this week with Capsigen</a>.</p>\n<p>Testing on another Nightstar therapy, for a rare eye disease called choroideremia, is still ongoing, and Biogen is now working with ViGeneron and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Institute on other gene therapies for the eye.</p>\n<p>The disappointing outcome reported Friday, however, could diminish confidence the choroideremia therapy will succeed. \"We think these results could serve as a canary in the coal mine given the overlap in technology,\" wrote Brian Skorney, an analyst at R W Baird, in an investor note. Results are expected later this year.</p>\n<p>And while Biogen's XLRP work is now set back, other companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AGTC and 4D Molecular Therapeutics are testing gene therapies for the disease, he pointed out.</p>", "date": "2021-05-16 10:50:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 14, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, ChemoCentryx, Avacopan, Novavax, NVX-oV2373, Curis, CA-4948, Biogen, Cotoretigene toliparvovec", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 14, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-16 10:44:25", "updated": "2021-05-16 10:59:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-14-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Infectious diseases, Oncology, Ophthalmics, Rare diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Biogen, ChemoCentryx, Curis, Novavax", "drug_tag": "avacopan, CA-4948, cotoretigene toliparvovec, NVX-CoV2373", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-16 10:50:00"}
