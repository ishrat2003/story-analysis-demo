The median time to sustained response for a sub-group of evaluable patients with mild disease was reduced by 3.1 days with NT-300.</p>\n<p>However, in looking at a key secondary endpoint, NT-300 reduced progression to severe disease in all evaluable patients by 85% compared with placebo. Only one person in the treatment arm progressed to severe COVID-19 disease.</p>\n<p>To put this in context, trials supporting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for monoclonal antibodies in subjects with mild or moderate COVID-19 showed reduction of progression to severe illness by 56% to 83%.</p>\n<p>Tampa, Florida-based Romark is currently working with the US Food and Drug Administration and plans to seek EUA. If granted, NT-300 could become the first COVID-19 treatment available to pick up at the drug store.</p>\n<p>NT-300, an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral that is being studied in a broad-range of acute respiratory illnesses, was well-tolerated in the clinical trial.</p>\n<p>Nitazoxanide, the active ingredient in NT-300 is also the active ingredient in Alinia, which is marketed by Romark for the treatment of diarrhea caused by parasitic infection. The drug has a favorable safety profile with minimal adverse events.</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 15:00:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "COVID-, Romark, antiviral, compound, treatment, trial, nitazoxanide, investigational, seek, treat, announced, Laboratories, Privately-held, initial, result", "meta_description": "Privately-held Romark Laboratories has announced initial results from a Phase III trial of its oral investigational antiviral compound NT-300 (nitazoxanide exte", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 14:57:45", "updated": "2021-04-14 16:08:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/romark-to-seek-eua-for-antiviral-compound-to-treat-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "romark_large-1-.png", "image2id": "romark_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-virals, Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Romark Laboratories", "drug_tag": "Nitazoxanide, NT-300", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 15:00:00"}
