Qbrexza generated $24 million in net sales in the USA in 2020.</p>\n<p>Qbrexza was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018, and is the only topical product for treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric populations (ages nine-years and older) and is self-administered by patients, cleared by the FDA. Additionally, Qbrexza is noted as a first-line treatment therapy for primary axillary hyperhidrosis by the International Hyperhidrosis Society (IHHS). Hyperhidrosis is a condition of sweating beyond what is physiologically required for normal thermal regulation and affects an estimated 4.8% of the US population, or around 15 million people.</p>\n<p>At the time of the US approval, peak annual sales of Qbrexza were forecast to reach $200 to $300 million by Cowen analysts.</p>\n<p>Claude Maraoui, president and chief executive of Journey Medical, stated, &ldquo;We are thrilled to expand our footprint in dermatology with the addition of Qbrexza to our growing portfolio of prescription dermatology brands. Acquiring Qbrexza will allow us to provide an accessible and convenient product to the millions of Americans who seek relief from excessive underarm sweating, many of whom remain undiagnosed and untreated.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>In two key pivotal trials within adult and pediatric patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, use of Qbrexza resulted in clinically-meaningful improvements in gravimetrically measured sweat production and disease severity, as measured by the Axillary Sweating Daily Diary, which was a validated, disease-specific patient-reported outcome developed in consultation with the FDA. The safety and efficacy of Qbrexza have been established in clinical trials with treatment for up to 48 weeks.</p>\n<p>Dr Lindsay Rosenwald, chairman, president and CEO of Fortress, added: &ldquo;The acquisition of Qbrexza marks continued progress for our partner company, Journey Medical, and demonstrates the success of Fortress&rsquo; unique business model, which is designed to acquire and rapidly advance potentially transformative products and product candidates to patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-01 17:17:00", "meta_title": "Fortress Biotech partner gets rights to Lilly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Qbrexza", "meta_keywords": "Journey Medical.
