{"contentid": 488368, "importid": NaN, "name": "2021 \"inflection point\" for Genmab, says chief executive", "introduction": "Danish company Genmab has a lot going on this year, as chief executive Jan van de Winkel tells The Pharma Letter.", "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Danish company Genmab (Nasdaq: GMAB) has a lot going on this year, as chief executive Jan van de Winkel tells The Pharma Letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the US regulator now agreeing to a </span><a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/genmab-and-seagen-s-bla-for-tisotumab-vedotin-accepted-for-priority-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speedy review</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of its &ldquo;trojan horse&rdquo; antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), tisotumab vedotin, the firm is &ldquo;building commercial teams&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;strengthening and broadening our internal capabilities,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnered with Seagen (Nasdaq: SGEN), the ADC is being pitched as an option for certain people with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, after chemotherapy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project with Seagen represents just one of six clinical-stage assets Genmab has in equal split partnerships, working with an impressive range of global drugmakers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firm is collaborating with companies including AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and rising mRNA superstar BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX), with agreements to co-develop and jointly commercialize resulting products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s no surprise, therefore, that Dr van de Winkel says the firm&rsquo;s product pipeline is &ldquo;maturing rapidly,&rdquo; with the company &ldquo;at a pivotal moment&rdquo; in its development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believes Genmab can become &ldquo;a fully integrated biotech innovation powerhouse, first focusing on two priority markets, the USA and Japan,&rdquo; to which end the company is currently &ldquo;scaling with purpose, precision and agility.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Pushing past the pandemic</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the unique challenges posed by the novel coronavirus, Dr van de Winkel personally oversaw the establishment of a &ldquo;COVID-19 response team&rdquo; to keep the company&rsquo;s mission on track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal was to implement &ldquo;precautionary measures to help limit the impact of COVID-19 at our workplace and on our communities while ensuring business continuity.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"...the deal with AbbVie...could net the company up to $4 billion.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firm is &ldquo;actively monitoring the potential impact on our key priorities and assessing the situation on an ongoing basis in close contact with clinical trial sites, physicians and contract research organizations,&rdquo; he explains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the pandemic, Genmab was able to achieve key milestones in 2020 including the establishment of a &ldquo;landmark oncology collaboration with AbbVie,&rdquo; as well as opening translational research labs in New Jersey, USA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular significance is the </span><a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/genmab-to-pocket-potential-4-billion-from-abbvie-deal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deal with AbbVie</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will see the firms jointly develop and commercialize three of Genmab&rsquo;s early-stage bispecific antibodies, and could net the company up to $4 billion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 was not all plain sailing, however, with the firm entering into a legal battle with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) over royalties for cancer drug Darzalex (daratumumab).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genmab commenced arbitration proceedings in order to settle whether or not it should share its royalties for a subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab with US biotech Halozyme Therapeutics (Nasdaq: HALO).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since analysts had expected Genmab to continue receiving royalties through to 2035, the news knocked a tenth off the firm&rsquo;s share price, with a binding arbitration process leaving open potential for a truncated payment schedule.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Collaboration and independence</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception, Genmab has had a strong focus on partnering to achieve its aims.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr van de Winkel says &ldquo;collaboration and networking has always been a part of our DNA,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;we believe partnerships are foundational to accelerate innovation and bring truly differentiated medicines to patients as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spun out of American biotech Medarex in 1999, the Copenhagen-based company began producing monoclonal antibodies for life-threatening or life-altering diseases, quickly drawing interest from investors and going public in October 2000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During its early phase of growth, the firm partnered with large companies, &ldquo;who had the capability and expertise for developing and commercializing clinical assets.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;These partnerships resulted in three human antibody medicines on the market that were created by Genmab,&rdquo; explains Dr van de Winkel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a sense, the company is now getting ready to fly the nest, &ldquo;guided by our vision that by 2025, our own product will have transformed cancer treatment and we will have a robust pipeline of next-generation antibodies.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a verdict from the US Food and Drug Administration on tisotumab vedotin due by early October, the milestone of launching a commercial medicine for the first time could be achieved much sooner.</span></p>", "date": "2021-04-16 12:35:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Genmab, company, Winkel, firm, Nasdaq, AbbVie, chief, executive, firms, cancer, partnerships, biotech, collaboration, royalties, antibodies, Letter, Pharma", "meta_description": "Danish company Genmab has a lot going on this year, as chief executive Jan van de Winkel tells The Pharma Letter.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-16 12:00:25", "updated": "2021-04-16 12:35:18", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/2021-inflection-point-for-genmab-says-chief-executive", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "jan_van_de_winkel_genmab_big.jpg", "image2id": "jan_van_de_winkel_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "CEO Interviews, Drug Trial, Focus On, In Depth, Interviews, Research", "geography_tag": "Denmark, USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Genmab, Seagen", "drug_tag": "Darzalex, tisotumab vedotin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-16 12:35:00"}
