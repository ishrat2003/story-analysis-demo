{"contentid": 487981, "importid": NaN, "name": "What will be 2021's most game-changing new drugs?", "introduction": "Clarivate today announced the launch of its annual \"Drugs to Watch\" list, identifying drugs entering the market or launching key indications in 2021 which are predicted to achieve blockbuster status by 2025.", "content": "<p>Clarivate Analytics (NYSE: CLVT) today announced the launch of its annual \"Drugs to Watch\" list, identifying drugs entering the market or launching key indications in 2021 which are predicted to achieve blockbuster status by 2025.</p>\n<p>Beyond the unprecedented achievements of the industry&rsquo;s response to COVID-19, drug developers have advanced milestone treatments for conditions affecting millions of patients worldwide, Clarivate noted.</p>\n<p>Despite a challenging year, biopharma companies managed to produce highly-effective vaccines and treatments aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2. This year&rsquo;s Drugs to Watch report also features a snapshot of the fast-emerging field of COVID-19 vaccines which analyzes vaccines that were granted emergency use authorizations/conditional approvals as of February 10, 2021.</p>\n<p>Learnings from some of the adjustments the industry made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely shape biopharma R&amp;D and commercialization well beyond the immediate crisis, including: faster clinical trials, a surge in investment, increased collaboration and more remote care and consultation. Among new drugs and biologics that have either won approval or are on the cusp of doing so, Clarivate has identified four treatments that are likely to achieve blockbuster status, delivering annual sales of more than $1 billion, within five years. The <em>2021 Drugs to Watch </em>include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Aducanumab, developed by Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai (TYO: 4528) </em></strong>&ndash; a potential game changer in the fight to build a pharmacopeia against Alzheimer's disease, which affects an estimated 50 million patients worldwide. If approved, aducanumab would be the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and could unlock a monumental opportunity to radically change patientcare and transform the market. If approved, demand for treatment will be enormous, potentially even decreasing willingness to forgo this treatment for an investigational drug in future clinical trials.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Bimekizumab, developed by UCB (Euronext: UCB) </em></strong>&ndash; which offers significantly fewer side effects to patients with psoriasis, a condition affecting an estimated 2%-3% of the global population, and a host of other autoimmune diseases. While bimekizumab is a late-class entrant providing incremental improvement over existing treatment options, it is expected to have best-in-class efficacy and fewer serious side effects.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Relugolix, developed by Myovant (Nasdaq: MYOV) </em></strong>&ndash; one of the first of a new class of treatments, with an oral formulation to address prostate cancer, the second-most-common malignancy afflicting men, as well as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, painful conditions affecting millions of women. Its potential use for three indications increases its chances of success. The oral formulation provides advantages over the injectable GnRH agonist competitors, including convenience and better management of side effects.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Vericiguat, developed by Bayer (BAYN: DE) and Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) </em></strong>&ndash; an innovative heart failure treatment and the first indicated specifically for high-risk, chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a particularly at-risk population. Vericiguat's novel mechanism of action should result in its acceptance as an add-on therapy to existing treatments. It will likely find its niche among high-risk HFrEF patients, become a welcome addition to the treatment armamentarium and expand their treatment options.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Increased rate of approvals</strong></h2>\n<p>Mike Ward, vice president, life sciences and healthcare, Clarivate, commented: &ldquo;After years of declining R&amp;D productivity, the last five years has seen an increase in approvals of innovative medicines at a rate more than double what it was a decade ago. A number of drivers have aligned to achieve this improvement, including greater insight into the biological roots of diseases, oncology research benefiting from the routine introduction of biomarkers to better target therapies, the emergence of gene and cell therapies and efforts by regulatory agencies to introduce processes to accelerate medicine assessment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s list reflects a trend towards specialty drugs launching with very narrow initial indications and expanding gradually into others, over many years. This trend is particularly true for oncology therapeutics, where a still-relatively-young field of immuno-oncology agents continues to expand its applications There is a high level of expectation of commercial success for each of the drugs featured in this year's list, with some expected to tout improved safety versus alternative therapies, while others will seek to highlight novel mechanisms of action. In addition to driving future innovation, these treatments have the potential to advance human health, redefine standards of care in their categories and save or improve patient lives.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-09 10:25:00", "meta_title": "What will be 2021's most game-changing new drugs?", "meta_keywords": "Drugs to watch, Clarivate, Aducanumab, Bimekizumab, Relugolix, Vericiguat", "meta_description": "What will be 2021's most game-changing new drugs?", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 10:22:49", "updated": "2021-03-10 09:08:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/what-will-be-2021-s-most-game-changing-new-drugs", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "clarivate_analytics_large.jpg", "image2id": "clarivate_analytics_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, CNS Diseases, Dermatologicals, Neurological, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Markets & Marketing, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Bayer, Biogen, Clarivate Analytics, Eisai, Merck & Co, Takeda, UCB", "drug_tag": "aducanumab, bimekizumab, relugolix, vericiguat", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-09 10:25:00"}
