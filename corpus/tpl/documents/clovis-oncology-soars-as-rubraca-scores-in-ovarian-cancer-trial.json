The stock was still up 47.7% at $7.86 by close of trading.</p>\n<p>Presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Virtual Annual Meeting on Women&rsquo;s Cancer (SGO), the ARIEL 4 study data demonstrate that Rubraca significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, among patients with advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer and a deleterious BRCA mutation who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Data from the ARIEL4 study meaningfully enhance our understanding about the role of Rubraca among women with BRCA mutation-positive relapsed ovarian cancer, as well as the clinical relevance of BRCA reversion mutations,&rdquo; said Dr Rebecca Kristeleit, co-coordinating Investigator of ARIEL4 and Consultant Medical Oncologist, Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. &ldquo;This is important because women with more advanced disease have fewer treatment options, and it is increasingly important to understand how specific mutations affect treatment outcomes,&rdquo; she explained.</p>\n<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>\n<p>The ARIEL4 study (NCT02855944) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized study evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in fully platinum-sensitive, partially platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed PFS, with a step-down analysis from the primary efficacy population (if significant) to the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The ARIEL4 data add to the growing scientific understanding about the clinical utilization of Rubraca compared to chemotherapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, for women diagnosed with BRCA mutation-positive advanced ovarian cancer,&rdquo; said Patrick Mahaffy, president and chief executive of Clovis. &ldquo;We remain committed to expanding treatment options for patients living with cancer and are pleased to share these data with physicians and their patients to help improve outcomes for women with ovarian cancer,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Ovarian cancer market</strong></h2>\n<p>According to industry analytics firm GlobalData, the ovarian cancer market was valued at $1.8 billion in 2018 across the seven major markets (7MM: USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan), and it is expected to grow to $6.7 billion in the next 10 years with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.4%.</p>\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration first granted accelerated approval to Rubraca to treat women with a certain type of ovarian cancer in 2016, and has since cleared the drug as maintenance treatment option for recurrent ovarian cancer as well as BRCA1/2-mutant castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>Clovis reported global net product revenues for Rubraca of $43.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, which included US product revenues of $36.4 million and ex-US product revenues of $6.9 million, respectively.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-20 15:08:00", "meta_title": "Clovis Oncology soars as Rubraca scores in ovarian cancer trial", "meta_keywords": "Clovis Oncology, Rubraca, Ovarian cancer, Phase III, PFS", "meta_description": "Clovis Oncology soars as Rubraca scores in ovarian cancer trial", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-20 15:07:04", "updated": "2021-03-20 15:14:10", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clovis-oncology-soars-as-rubraca-scores-in-ovarian-cancer-trial", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "clovis_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "clovis_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Ovarian cancer", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Clovis Oncology", "drug_tag": "Rubraca", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-20 15:08:00"}
