A proposal detailing mandatory spending requests - which includes Medicaid and Medicare - will come later, said White House officials.</p>\n<h2><strong>$6.5 billion requested to set up ARPA-H</strong></h2>\n<p>Within the totality of the requests, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would grow by $9 billion to $51 billion. That total includes $6.5 billion for a new entity, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health (ARPA-H), that would initially focus on research into cancer and other diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer&rsquo;s. The APRA-H&rsquo;s aims would be to &ldquo;drive transformational innovation in health research and speed applications.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If the agency is established, it could mark a fundamental shift in how the US government funds research, steering the emphasis from basic science to higher-risk projects more directly aimed at major medical breakthroughs, observers have noted.</p>\n<p>President Biden called for a $1.6 billion funding increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - a boost that represents almost a quarter of the agency&rsquo;s current budget - to help increase core public health capacity at the federal and state level. The money could also be used to help build out public health data infrastructure and train new public health experts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would get a big boost to both its research and industrial programs. Spending on NIST&rsquo;s research labs would grow by $124 million, to $916 million, and its investment in a network of manufacturing institutes would more than double, to $442 million.</p>", "date": "2021-04-12 15:00:00", "meta_title": "US President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discretionary funding request includes new research age", "meta_keywords": "US President, Joe Biden, Discretionary, Funding request,  Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA-H, CDC, NIH", "meta_description": "US President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discretionary funding request includes new research agency", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-12 14:59:30", "updated": "2021-04-12 15:07:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-president-s-discretionary-funding-request-includes-new-research-agency", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biden_big.jpg", "image2id": "biden_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Diabetes, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Biden administration, Financial, Government Affairs, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-12 15:00:00"}
