Editor</p>\n<p>Last week saw Novartis&rsquo; Sandoz unit on Monday announce it is progressing the development of biosimilars to Bayer and Regeneron&rsquo;s blockbuster ophthalmic drug Eylea. Also of note, the US medicine cost watchdog, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), issued a draft report questioning the benefit/risk of Biogen and Eisai&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease candidate aducanumab. And Roivant Sciences entered into a $7.3 billion SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) deal with Montes Archimedes to go public. Marking an important new indication for Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the blockbuster drug for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sandoz Phase III plans for Eylea biosimilar is a win for Regeneron</strong></h2>\n<p>Novartis&rsquo;s generic and biosimilar division, Sandoz, last Monday confirmed late-stage development <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/progress-on-proposed-biosimilars-of-eye-drugs-eylea-and-lucentis\">plans for an Eylea biosimilar</a>. Novartis confirmed that it will be required to complete a Phase III safety and efficacy study comparing their biosimilar to Regeneron&rsquo;s Eylea, noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>\n<p>He regards this as a stringent bar for approval of a biosimilar, and basically eliminates the possibility of accelerated approval based on bioequivalence. Moreover, it is by no means certain that Sandoz&rsquo; biosimilar will be non-inferior. If there are any severe adverse event (ocular) imbalances between the active and control arms, the biosimilar may never come to market, he said.</p>\n<p>Safety events with unknown origin (believed to be formulation or manufacturing components) with Novartis&rsquo;s Beovu and previously with Allergan&rsquo;s abicipar pegol resulted in slightly higher rates of such events, and then either commercial or development failure. Mr Porges expects Novartis&rsquo; MYLIGHT study will face relatively slow enrollment compared to other studies, since participants must accept a year of treatment with an unproven medicine as a condition of participation, and it is unlikely that the FDA will accept an exclusively or largely non-US study to be the basis of approval.</p>\n<p>That being said, he believes Sandoz&rsquo;s reputation as a quality generic and biosimilar manufacturer and its clinical trial experience and network should result in the trial being completed and the product approved most likely around 2024 or 2025. Assuming MYLIGHT begins enrollment imminently, he estimates the biosimilar could potentially reach the market no sooner than 2024.</p>\n<p>Leerink currently estimate 2024 and 2025 US Eylea revenue of $5.5 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, with year-on-year growth of -5% and -4%. At this stage it forecasts biosimilars entering the market in 2021 (likely a Lucentis biosimilar), and beyond 2025 forecasts US Eylea revenue erosion of 4%-19%/year. Mr Porges believes the loss in sales of Eylea will come as much from the entry of competitors with products that can extend treatment intervals, such as Kodiak&rsquo;s KSI-301 (approval expected in 2023). He believes Eylea&rsquo;s share loss to the biosimilar should be minimal since he expects the biosimilar to be priced at a discount to the branded product (initially 20-30% discount, ie, $1,295-$1,480 per month) rather than at the price of the compounded Avastin ($50 per monthly dose).</p>\n<h2><strong>ICER, unconvinced by Biogen data, suggests low price for Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug</strong></h2>\n<p>Clinical trial results used by Biogen to apply for US approval of its experimental <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-questions-aducanumab-s-health-benefit-in-early-price-review\">Alzheimer's drug aducanumab</a> are \"insufficient\" to determine whether treatment would actually help patients, according to an influential non-profit that assesses the value of new medicines, according to Ned Pagliarulo writing on BioPharma Dive.</p>\n<p>Any benefit observed in human testing of the drug is highly uncertain, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said in a preliminary report released Wednesday, pushing back against several of Biogen's explanations for why two near identical late-stage studies of aducanumab had conflicting outcomes.</p>\n<p>The ICER's conclusions are another knock against the treatment, which has divided Alzheimer's researchers and doctors ever since Biogen <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-submit-fda-alzheimers-drug-aducanumab/565538/\">controversially declared</a> one of the trials a success just months after judging both <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-alzheimers-aducanumab-clinical-failure-halt/551004/\">unlikely to meet their goals</a>. Aducanumab is now under review for at the Food and Drug Administration, with a decision on approval expected by June 7.</p>\n<p>The FDA worked closely with Biogen to reinterpret the initial study findings using additional data following Biogen's March 2019 decision to discontinue both studies. But last November a panel of independent advisers to the agency overwhelmingly rejected Biogen and the FDA's case for aducanumab, creating new doubt about the result of the regulator's review, said Mr Pagliarulo.</p>\n<p>Critics, including several members of the FDA advisory committee that met last November, have emphasized this point and noted both Biogen and the regulator appear to be assuming the negative trial missed aducanumab's benefit, rather than being a true result.</p>\n<p>The ICER also calculated the cost-effective price for scenarios that assume \"optimistic\" and \"conservative\" treatment benefits. The former scenario relies only on the positive study results, in which case aducanumab could be priced between $11,100 and $23,100 and still be cost-effective. The latter assumes only patients with mild cognitive impairment benefit from treatment, reducing the cost-effective range to between $1,200 and $4,200.</p>\n<p>Biogen has kept its plans for pricing aducanumab close, although it appears the company has decided on a number. \"I think that we are there,\" company chief executive Michel Vounatsos said on <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-aducanumab-review-uncertain-launch/598890/\">a recent earnings call</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Roivant rewrites the SPAB script, again</strong></h2>\n<p>Just when it seemed that Immunovant, the SPAC poster child, was about to disprove the rationale behind this business model, its <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roivant-merging-with-montes-archimedes-to-go-public-in-7-3-billion-spav-deal\">parent company, Roivant</a>, has moved to rewrite the script by gaining a private listing of its own &ndash; via a SPAC, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>The deal will give Roivant another $556 million, to bring net cash up to $2.3 billion. However, anyone thinking that this is a sign of Vivek Ramaswamy relinquishing control of Roivant will be in for a shock: even after the complex quadripartite SPAC transaction that will give it a public listing, Roivant will be 86% held by the investors who currently own it privately.</p>\n<p>Thus, the main purpose of reversing into the special-purpose acquisition company currently known as Montes Archimedes Acquisition Corp appears to be to value Roivant publicly by listing a minority stake. The deal also allows cash reserves to be topped up, and Silicon Therapeutics, a separate entity being acquired, to be integrated.</p>\n<p>One of the interesting things about a SPAC transaction is that it lays bare, for regulatory compliance reasons, the precise sources of funding and resulting equity shares above.</p>\n<p>It also details the precise ownership status and attendant obligations of the transaction&rsquo;s subject. Thus this deal shines a light into the Roivant stable of companies, around which there had previously been a little less clarity.</p>\n<h2><strong>A surprise Keytruda approval, and what it means for biotech</strong></h2>\n<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s surprising <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accelerated-approval-to-keytruda-for-her2-positive-gastric-cancer\">US approval of a Keytruda/Herceptin/chemo triple combo</a> that few had even realized had been filed shines a light on data from its supporting Keynote-811 study. The trial&rsquo;s results were to be presented for the first time at ASCO next month, but thanks to Keytruda&rsquo;s new label they can be seen today, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>The data concern remission rates, and show a benefit versus Herceptin and chemo alone, an important fact that could affect development strategies from biotechs including Pieris and Silverback. And, of course, the unexpected approval allows Keytruda to compete against Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s Opdivo in an important setting.</p>\n<p>The US green light, on an accelerated basis, concerns first-line HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In April, Opdivo was approved in this cancer with no stipulation about HER2 status, but its label stresses that the supporting study, Checkmate-649, excluded HER|2-positive patients.</p>\n<p>Leerink analysts reckon some 10,000 gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma patients are treated first line each year, and around a quarter are Her2-positive, which amounts to a $300m market.</p>\n<p>Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch called the go-ahead a &ldquo;positive surprise&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s based on interim tumor response data. The approval keeps Keytruda in the stomach cancer market, which has become increasingly important for makers of PD-1/L1 inhibitors, she said in a Wednesday note to clients.</p>\n<p>Although Opdivo&rsquo;s and Keytruda&rsquo;s approvals give them separate markets divided by HER2 status, Dr Graybosch suggested patient selection will come down to physician preference. &ldquo;We believe physicians and payers would view Opdivo and Keytruda as interchangeable in setting,&rdquo; Dr Graybosch said in the note.</p>\n<p>Mr Plieth noted that the result is relevant not only for Merck and Bristol Myers, but also for several other companies testing the combination of Her2 inhibition with immune system stimulation. This includes CD3-targting T-cell engagers, as well as a more recent generation of so-called immune-stimulatory antibody conjugates, or Isacs.</p>\n<p>The latter group includes <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/snippets/aacr-2021-pieris-might-have-bet-combinations\">Pieris&rsquo;s troubled cinrebafusp</a>, which adds 4-1BB co-stimulation to HER2 blockade, Innovent&rsquo;s IBI315, a straight HER2 x PD-1 directed bispecific, and a trio of ADCs from Bolt Therapeutics, Silverback and Novartis that use TLR7 and/or TLR8 agonism for immune system stimulation, he noted.</p>", "date": "2021-05-09 10:52:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 7, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Novartis, Sandoz, Eylea, Biosimilars, Biogen, Eisai, Aducanumab, Roivant, Montes Archimedes, Merck & Co, Keytruda", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 7, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-09 10:51:04", "updated": "2021-05-09 11:05:35", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-7-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars, Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Immuno-oncology, Neurological, Ophthalmics", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Drug Trial, Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Biogen, Eisai, Merck & Co, Montes Archimedes Acquisition, Novartis, Roivant Sciences, Sandoz", "drug_tag": "aducanumab, Eylea (aflibercept Injection, Keytruda", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-09 10:52:00"}
