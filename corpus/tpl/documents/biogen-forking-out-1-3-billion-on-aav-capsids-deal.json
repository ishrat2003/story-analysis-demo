Capsids are the protein coat that protects and facilitates delivery of the virus&rsquo; genetic payload into host cells. The collaboration will leverage Capsigen&rsquo;s capsid engineering expertise and Biogen&rsquo;s discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities with the goal to accelerate delivery of gene therapies to patients in need.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Capsigen will apply its vector engineering approaches to develop novel capsids designed to meet highly customized, disease-specific transduction profiles. Biogen will receive an exclusive license under Capsigen&rsquo;s proprietary technology for an undisclosed number of CNS and neuromuscular disease targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial terms</strong></p>\n<p>Capsigen will receive a $15 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $42 million in potential research milestones and up to an additional $1.25 billion in potential development and commercial payments should the collaboration programs achieve certain developmental milestones and sales thresholds. Capsigen is also eligible to receive royalties on future net sales of products that incorporate capsids resulting from the collaboration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Through this collaboration, we aim to solve key technological challenges in the delivery of gene therapies to target tissues. One of our priorities for technology innovation is the discovery of AAV capsids with improved delivery profiles,&rdquo; said Dr Alfred Sandrock Jr, head of R&amp;D at Biogen. &ldquo;We are investing for the long-term by building platform capabilities and advanced manufacturing technologies with the goal of accelerating our efforts in gene therapy,&rdquo; he noted.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;At Capsigen, we believe the next revolution in gene therapy will be driven by engineered AAV capsids designed to meet disease-specific transduction profiles,&rdquo; said John Bial, chief executive of Capsigen, adding: &ldquo;Biogen is a leader in neuroscience, and we are excited for the opportunity to work with them to potentially bring new treatments to patients. This collaboration is consistent with our strategy to work with world-class companies to develop the next generation of gene therapies.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-12 12:33:00", "meta_title": "Biogen forking out $1.3 billion on AAV capsids deal", "meta_keywords": "Biogen, Capsigen, Collaboration, License, CNS, Neuromuscular disorders, Gene therapies, AAV capsids", "meta_description": "Biogen forking out $1.3 billion on AAV capsids deal", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-12 12:32:41", "updated": "2021-05-12 12:39:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-forking-out-1-3-billion-on-aav-capsids-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biogen_large.jpg", "image2id": "biogen_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Biogen, Capsigen", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-12 12:33:00"}
