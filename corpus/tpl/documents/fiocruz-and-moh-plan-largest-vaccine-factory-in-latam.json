Brazil has imported a large number of biopharmaceuticals for several diseases. Our challenge, the challenge for all Fiocruz, is to overcome this dependence, which will be another great achievement for the institution. In this way, we will be able to fully meet all the SUS (Brazilian Public Health System) demands and still export vaccines whenever our assistance is required&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Fiocruz president, N&iacute;sia Trindade Lima, also emphasized the many shortcomings of the Brazilian health system in the technological area and noted that Cibs will make an important contribution to reducing this problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cibs points not only to the present needs, such as those of the pandemic but mostly to the future, to the next challenges that the country will face in health. With this undertaking, the country takes a fundamental step to guarantee its autonomy in the immunobiological production&rdquo;, she said.</p>\n<h2><strong>CIBS in the Public Health System </strong></h2>\n<p>The project will be the largest center for the production of biological products in Latin America and one of the most modern in the world. Thus, Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz will be able to increase the production capacity of vaccines and biopharmaceuticals four-fold - a number that may be even greater depending on the product mix - in order to give priority to the Brazilian population demands through the Public Health System (SUS).</p>\n<p>For the project to be built, the investment will take place within a modality considered innovative within the federal government scope, called Built to Suit. Under this model, the financing will be private, paid in the form of rent, and with the equity reversion after the 15-year term. The investment is of the order of 3.4 billion real ($610 million) and foresees the generation of 5,000 direct jobs in this stage of works and 1,500 jobs for the operation of the enterprise.</p>", "date": "2021-03-01 10:29:00", "meta_title": "Fiocruz and MoH plan largest vaccine factory in LatAm", "meta_keywords": "Fiocruz, Health Ministry, Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Production, Immunological, Vaccines, Latin America", "meta_description": "Fiocruz and MoH plan largest vaccine factory in LatAm", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-01 10:27:59", "updated": "2021-03-01 10:36:04", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fiocruz-and-moh-plan-largest-vaccine-factory-in-latam", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "brazil-big.jpg", "image2id": "brazil-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Government Affairs, Production", "geography_tag": "Brazil, South America", "company_tag": "Fiocruz", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-01 10:29:00"}
