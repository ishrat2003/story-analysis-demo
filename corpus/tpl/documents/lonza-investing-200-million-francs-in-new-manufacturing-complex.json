The first buildout represents a dedicated manufacturing line for antibody-drug conjugate payload molecules, which is expected to start its first operations in third-quarter 2023. Upon completion, the manufacturing complex will employ approximately 200 people.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This collaboration is a great example of how we are supporting our customers with flexible business models. Our customers developing highly potent and increasingly complex medicines trust us to handle these toxic substances throughout their clinical and commercial lifecycle. The investment to realize this new manufacturing complex for small molecules creates a substantial footprint for accelerating future growth capacity across the range of our small molecule service offering,&rdquo; commented Gordon Bates, president and head of small molecules at Lonza.</p>", "date": "2021-04-23 14:42:00", "meta_title": "Lonza investing 200 million francs in new manufacturing complex", "meta_keywords": "Lonza, Investment, Manufacturing complex, Small molecules", "meta_description": "Lonza investing 200 million francs in new manufacturing complex", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-23 14:41:40", "updated": "2021-04-23 14:47:02", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lonza-investing-200-million-francs-in-new-manufacturing-complex", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "lonza_big.png", "image2id": "lonza_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Manufacturing facility", "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Outsourcing, CRO and CMO, Production", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Lonza", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-23 14:42:00"}
