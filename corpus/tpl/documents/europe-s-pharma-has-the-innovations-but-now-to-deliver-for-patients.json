The comprehensive report found that in 2020 alone, around 5,000 clinical trials were launched &ndash; despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the volume of trials has increased over the past five years.</p>\n<p>The Review paints a picture of a healthy innovative pipeline, focused on major unmet needs: 40% of trials are on substances targeting rare diseases, while ground-breaking cell and gene therapies continue to grow in importance, notes EFPIA director general Nathalie Moll.</p>\n<p>The example of gene therapies is particularly inspiring. By replacing defective or missing genes, scientists aim to cure life-long and highly debilitating diseases such as haemophilia. CAR-T treatments, a type of cell therapy which are already transforming the lives of people with blood cancers, are now being studied also against solid tumors. This could be a future game-changer for many forms of cancer.</p>\n<p>The report also points to progress on Alzheimer&rsquo;s treatments which researchers hope will delay the onset and progression of dementia; remyelinating therapies with the potential to restore mobility and vision in people with multiple sclerosis; and curative therapies for HIV and hepatitis B. And let&rsquo;s not forget breakthrough mRNA technologies which have given us the first COVID-19 vaccines and could one day be used to treat aggressive brain cancer, said Ms Moll.</p>\n<h2><strong>Preparing for the future</strong></h2>\n<p>The Pipeline Review surely inspires optimism about the overall trajectory of medical innovation and comes with a caveat. Our capacity to continue to develop and deploy the results of these research efforts requires fresh thinking about Europe&rsquo;s research ecosystem and healthcare infrastructure. Many times, however, clinical trials which are both vital for the research eco-system as well as the first chance for many patients to get access to ground-breaking therapies, do not take place in Europe, but in the USA, China and other regions. While it is clear that past innovations have improved patient outcomes, and the coming wave of advances can go much further, now is the moment for preparation as well as celebration.</p>\n<p>The report identifies areas where industry can work with other stakeholders to pave the way for the new therapies and vaccines that the pipeline can deliver. It is a recipe for making Europe a global leader in medical innovation while ensuring that our patients have access to interventions that could improve &ndash; or save &ndash; their lives.</p>\n<p>For a start, we need to adapt our regulatory processes to better suit the kinds of therapies coming down the track. The clinical development and production of the new advanced therapies on the horizon require new approval pathways.</p>\n<p>Equally, today&rsquo;s approaches to Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and pricing and payment may be ill-suited to tomorrow&rsquo;s therapies. New approaches to funding truly innovative treatments will be essential to their use, as well as robust systems for data capture to monitor the effectiveness of new treatments in real life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://efpia-current.cmail20.com/t/i-l-mhjmtl-jtjyiklh-p/\"><strong>Download the Pipeline Review report</strong></a></p>", "date": "2021-03-26 10:06:00", "meta_title": "Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pharma has the innovations, but now to deliver for patients?", "meta_keywords": "EFPIA, Pipeline Review, Innovation, Medicines, Delivery, Access, Regulation, HTAs", "meta_description": "Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pharma has the innovations, but now to deliver for patients?", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 17:46:05", "updated": "2021-03-26 10:08:09", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/europe-s-pharma-has-the-innovations-but-now-to-deliver-for-patients", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "efpia-big-3.png", "image2id": "efpia-small-1.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Oncology, Rare diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": "EFPIA", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-26 10:06:00"}
