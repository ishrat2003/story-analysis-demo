Yet as challenging as 2020 was, it also brought us &ndash; Sanofi and the pharmaceutical industry &ndash; closer to our purpose than at any other time in living memory,&rdquo; said Mr Hudson.</p>\n<h2><strong>Pillar of access to essential medicines</strong></h2>\n<p>A cornerstone of Sanofi&rsquo;s CSR strategy, Sanofi Global Health is a newly-formed non-profit unit within the company. Leveraging the company&rsquo;s diverse and large portfolio of medicines and global footprint, Sanofi Global Health is dedicated to increasing access to medicines considered essential by the World Health Organization (WHO) for patients in&nbsp;40 lower income countries. 30 of Sanofi's medicines will be provided across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, malaria and cancer<strong>. </strong>Sanofi Global Health will also fund the training of healthcare professionals or the set up and development of sustainable care systems for those who suffer from chronic diseases and require complex care.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Sanofi is committed to helping 1,000 patients living with rare diseases who have no access to treatments and will donate 100,000 vials of medicine for their treatments each year. This continues Sanofi&rsquo;s 30-year commitment to patients suffering from rare diseases, such as Fabry, Gaucher or Pompe diseases, for which access to treatment is often limited.</p>\n<p>Sanofi also continues to support vulnerable communities and commits to developing innovative medicines for pediatric cancer, with the ultimate ambition of eliminating cancer deaths in children. In low- to middle-income countries, a child is four times more likely to die of pediatric cancers than children living in high-income countries.</p>\n<p>Sanofi also continues its efforts to fight polio and sleeping sickness, two of its historical programs that address global health issues.
