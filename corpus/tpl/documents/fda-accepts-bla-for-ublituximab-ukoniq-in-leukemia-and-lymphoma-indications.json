According to Evaluate Vantage at that time, Ukoniq should achieve annual sales of $254 million by 2026. An FDA decision is also set for June for umbralisib in follicular lymphoma, while a bigger opportunity lies ahead with a combination with ublituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, said Evaluate Vantage.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>&ldquo;Important milestone&rdquo; for the company</strong></h2>\n<p>Michael Weiss, executive chairman and chief executive of TG Therapeutics stated: &ldquo;We are extremely pleased that the ublituximab BLA has been accepted by the FDA. This is an important milestone for us as it brings us one step closer to our goal of providing a novel combination treatment option to patients with both treatment naive and relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL. We look forward to collaborating with the FDA throughout this review process.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The BLA submission was based on the results of the UNITY-CLL trial, a global Phase III study evaluating the combination of ublituximab plus Ukoniq (U2) compared to obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with treatment naive and relapsed or refractory CLL.
