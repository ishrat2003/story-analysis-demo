It will accelerate the clinical development of sonelokimab, building on robust clinical data generated by Merck and by Ablynx, a Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) company, which discovered the molecule. No financial terms of the accord are disclosed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sonelokimab has clinically demonstrated potential to drive disease modification in dermatology and rheumatology patients. Sonelokimab is a tri-specific, balanced interleukin (IL)-17A/F inhibitor with an albumin binding site, which has the potential to facilitate deep tissue penetration in the skin and joints.</p>\n<p>Dr Kristian Reich, chief scientific officer and co-founder of MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, commented: &ldquo;Sonelokimab is a remarkable Nanobody with game-changing potential in the treatment of a range of IL-17A/F-driven inflammatory diseases. As a d<a id=\"save\" class=\"save\" title=\"Save\"></a>Saveermatologist with over 25 years of experimental and clinical experience in immunology, I believe MoonLake Immunotherapeutics has a unique opportunity to build on the excellent development work of Merck KGaA and Ablynx. Our goal is to unlock the full potential of sonelokimab, giving millions of patients with skin and joint diseases a chance of better disease control.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MoonLake Immunotherapeutics was founded in 2021, backed by a Series A financing led by BVF Partners. Other investors include Merck KGaA. The company has been founded by a highly expert executive leadership team with decades of experience in immunology, including discovery, clinical development, regulatory affairs, product launch, commercialization and business development.</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 14:03:00", "meta_title": "Launch of MoonLake Immunotherapeutics with in-license of Merck's IL-17", "meta_keywords": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics,  Merck KGaA, IL-17 nanobody, Sonelokimab, Skin, Joint  diseases", "meta_description": "Launch of MoonLake Immunotherapeutics with in-license of Merck's IL-17 nanobody", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-04 14:01:49", "updated": "2021-05-04 14:13:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/launch-of-moonlake-immunotherapeutics-with-in-license-of-merck-s-il-17-nanobody", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "merck_kgaa_new_large.jpg", "image2id": "merck_kgaa_new_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Dermatologicals, Immunologicals", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, Switzerland", "company_tag": "Merck KGaA, MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "sonelokimab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 14:03:00"}
