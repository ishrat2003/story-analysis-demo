Praluent is not intended to be used alone but instead added to other treatments for HoFH.</p>\n<p>The approval was granted to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: REGN), which markets Praluent, a PCSK9 inhibitor, in partnership with French pharma major French partner Sanofi (Euronext: SAN).</p>\n<p>Once billed as having blockbuster potential when first launched in 2015, the drug has never been a big seller for the companies. Sanofi registered full-year 2020 revenues from Praluent of 261 million euros ($316 million), while US sale last year came in at $186 million.</p>\n<p><strong>A rare, life-threatening condition</strong></p>\n<p>HoFH is a rare, life-threatening condition that occurs in around 1 in 250,000 individuals. Patients with HoFH have two mutations in a small group of genes that controls the way the body clears cholesterol. As a result, patients have extremely high circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), commonly known as &ldquo;bad cholesterol.&rdquo; These cholesterol levels can range as high as 500-1,000 mg/dL, more than four times the normal levels.</p>\n<p>Patients with HoFH can develop premature cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and heart disease, when they are teenagers or in their 20s, and many do not improve substantially with other cholesterol-lowering drugs. Without aggressive treatment, patients may die before age 30.</p>\n<p>Praluent is also approved to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina (a condition in which the heart does not receive enough blood flow and oxygen) requiring hospitalization in adults with cardiovascular disease. In addition, Praluent is approved to be used alone or in addition to diet or other therapies to treat primary hyperlipidemia (certain forms of high cholesterol).</p>", "date": "2021-04-02 13:37:00", "meta_title": "FDA grants a new indication for Praluent", "meta_keywords": "Regeneron, Sanofi, Praluent, FDA, Indication, HoFH, Hypercholesterolemia, Familial, Homozygous", "meta_description": "FDA grants a new indication for Praluent", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-02 13:35:42", "updated": "2021-04-02 13:44:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-grants-a-new-indication-for-praluent", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sanofi-regeneron-big.jpg", "image2id": "sanofi-regeneron-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "France, USA", "company_tag": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "Praluent", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-02 13:37:00"}
