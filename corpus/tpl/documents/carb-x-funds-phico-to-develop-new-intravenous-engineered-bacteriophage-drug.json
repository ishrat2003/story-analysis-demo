If successful, this new intravenous drug could transform the way patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia are treated in hospitals, and save lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Heather Fairhead, Phico Founder and chief executive, said: &ldquo;To receive funding from CARB-X is important validation for our SASPject technology platform and its potential in fighting bacterial resistance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It has been awarded at the end of a due diligence process which reinforces the credibility of the company and our team &ndash; I am delighted to now look forward to progressing our lead product to clinical trials and developing a product pipeline that will advance the science of antibacterial therapy and in time, save millions of lives round the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-19 15:51:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "CARB-X, engineered, develop, intravenous, Phico, drug, aeruginosa, Pseudomonas, bacteriophage, funding, bacteria, ventilator-associated, pneumonia, company", "meta_description": "Global non-profit partnership CARB-X is funding privately-held UK company Phico Therapeutics to develop a new intravenous engineered bacteriophage drug to treat", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-19 15:40:45", "updated": "2021-04-19 16:26:05", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/carb-x-funds-phico-to-develop-new-intravenous-engineered-bacteriophage-drug", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "carb-x_big.png", "image2id": "carb-x_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics, Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Business Financing, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Public health, Research", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Carb-X, Phico Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "SASPject PT3.9", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-19 15:51:00"}
