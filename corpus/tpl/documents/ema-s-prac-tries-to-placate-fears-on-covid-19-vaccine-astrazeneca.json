The position of&nbsp;PRAC&nbsp;is that the vaccine&rsquo;s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Recommendation to update information</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, following the assessment of a safety signal regarding cases of&nbsp;anaphylaxis with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca,&nbsp;PRAC&nbsp;has recommended an update to the product information.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that the information should now state that anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity are potential side effects, with an unknown frequency, and to update the existing warning to reflect that cases of anaphylaxis have been reported.</p>\n<p>The update is based on a review of 41 reports of possible anaphylaxis seen among around five million vaccinations in the UK. After careful review of the data,&nbsp;PRAC&nbsp;considered that a link to the vaccine was likely in at least some of these cases.</p>\n<h2>Review of all three vaccines</h2>\n<p>PRAC&nbsp;has also started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of immune thrombocytopenia in patients who received any of the three COVID-19 vaccines that were approved prior to this week. As well as the AstraZeneca jab, these include Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BNTX) Comirnaty and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>\n<p>The EMA statement explains: &ldquo;After reviewing the safety reports received so far, PRAC&nbsp;decided to request an in-depth review of all available data, including case reports, clinical trials and the published literature, from the respective marketing authorization holders for these vaccines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination and the reports of immune thrombocytopenia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Finally,&nbsp;<span class=\"il\">PRAC</span>&nbsp;has started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of localized swelling after vaccination with Comirnaty in people with a history of injections with dermal fillers.</p>", "date": "2021-03-12 16:42:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-12 16:27:47", "updated": "2021-03-12 17:51:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-s-prac-tries-to-placate-fears-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_large.png", "image2id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, Sweden, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-12 16:42:00"}
