Cowan analyst Phil Nadeau said Trodelvy is expected to have $4 billion in peak sales.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s accelerated approval is thanks to the patients and healthcare professionals involved in the TROPHY study, and we appreciate their partnership,&rdquo; said Dr Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer, Gilead Sciences, adding: &ldquo;This achievement, coupled with last week&rsquo;s full FDA approval in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, underscores our commitment toward rapidly delivering Trodelvy to patients facing some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing and regulatory status</strong></h2>\n<p>Efficacy and safety were evaluated in TROPHY (IMMU-132-06; NCT03547973), a single-arm, multicenter trial that enrolled 112 patients with locally advanced or mUC who received prior treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Patients received sacituzumab govitecan, 10mg/kg intravenously, on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle.</p>\n<p>Beyond the regulatory approvals of Trodelvy in the USA, regulatory reviews for Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC are currently underway in the European Union, UK, Canada, Switzerland and Australia, as well as in Singapore, through partner Everest Medicines. Trodelvy is also being developed as an investigational treatment for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER 2-) metastatic breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Additional evaluation across multiple solid tumors is also underway.</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 10:57:00", "meta_title": "FDA accelerated approval for Trodelvy in advanced urothelial cancer", "meta_keywords": "Gilead Sciences, Trodelvy, Cancer, Urothelial, FDA, Approval, Accelerated, Immunomedics", "meta_description": "FDA accelerated approval for Trodelvy in advanced urothelial cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 10:56:28", "updated": "2021-04-14 11:03:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accelerated-approval-for-trodelvy-in-advanced-urothelial-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "gilead-big.jpg", "image2id": "gilead-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Immunomedics", "drug_tag": "Trodelvy", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 10:57:00"}
