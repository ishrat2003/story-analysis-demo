Since the study was powered to investigate changes in biomarker levels, not to demonstrate efficacy, we believe these results are that much more impactful.\"</p>\n<h2>Encouraging signs</h2>\n<p>While it is still early days, the results from the Phase IIa study compare favorably with other trials in Alzheimer&rsquo;s, an area of research which has proved stubbornly resistant to progress in recent years.</p>\n<p>For example, data from the Phase III EMERGE study, from Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB), showed a much smaller 1.4 point improvement in a similar test, ADAS-Cog13, after one year.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year Cassava Sciences (Nasdaq: SAVA) reported a 1.6 point improvement in the same test Annovis is using, ADAS-Cog11, after six months.</p>\n<p>The trial is small, however, enrolling just 28 people with either AD or PD, and it remains to be seen whether the result will hold up after further testing.</p>\n<p>The company plans to request a meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration to present the results, with a view towards progressing into late-stage studies in late 2021, if all goes well.</p>", "date": "2021-05-24 12:18:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-24 12:17:36", "updated": "2021-05-24 13:52:01", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/signs-of-a-possible-breakthrough-in-alzheimer-s-and-parkinson-s", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "brain_pain_head_big.jpg", "image2id": "brain_pain_head_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Annovis Bio", "drug_tag": "ANVS401", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-24 12:18:00"}
