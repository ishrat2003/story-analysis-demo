The data analyses showed statistically -significant changes for DCCR compared to placebo in the primary and key secondary endpoints. Following its review of the data submitted by Soleno, the FDA informed the company on March 5, 2021 that an additional controlled clinical trial will be necessary to support an NDA submission for DCCR in PWS.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We intend to continue the dialogue with the FDA to ensure that DCCR is approved for individuals with PWS as expeditiously as possible,&rdquo; said Dr Anish Bhatnagar, chief executive of Soleno Therapeutics, adding: &ldquo;Based on the totality of data generated to date, we remain confident in DCCR&rsquo;s potential to address the unmet need for a safe and effective treatment option for PWS patients. We are currently evaluating the appropriate next steps for our DCCR program.</p>\n<h2><strong>Previous failures</strong></h2>\n<p>Last June, Soleno&rsquo;s shares were also pummelled, when the company released top-line results from the Phase III trial, DESTINY PWS (C601), that failed to meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline in hyperphagia, the predominant symptom of PWS.</p>\n<p>However, Soleno is not the only drug developer that has faced challenges in the PWS space.</p>\n<p>Last year, Millendo Therapeutics (Nasdaq: MLND) announced that it is discontinuing the development of livoletide as a potential treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome.</p>\n<p>Also, Boston, USA-based biotech firm Zafgen (Nasdaq: ZFGN) in 2016 abandoned its lead compound beloranib in PWS following a spectacular failure in late-stage testing that cost lives.</p>", "date": "2021-03-09 12:39:00", "meta_title": "Soleno tanks as FDA calls for additional trial of Prader-Willi candida", "meta_keywords": "Soleno Therapeutics, DCCCR, Diazoxide choline, Prader-Willy syndrome, FDA, NDA, Additional trial", "meta_description": "Soleno tanks as FDA calls for additional trial of Prader-Willi candidate", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 12:39:02", "updated": "2021-03-09 12:48:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/soleno-tanks-as-fda-calls-for-additional-trial-of-prader-willi-candidate", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fda_big.jpg", "image2id": "fda_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Prader-Willi Syndrome", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Soleno Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "diazoxide choline", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-09 12:39:00"}
