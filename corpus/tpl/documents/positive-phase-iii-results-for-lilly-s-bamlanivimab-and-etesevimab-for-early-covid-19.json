{"contentid": 488014, "importid": NaN, "name": "Positive Phase III results for Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab for early COVID-19", "introduction": "US pharma major Eli Lilly yesterday announced new data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled BLAZE-1 Phase III study, demonstrating bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700mg and etesevimab (LY-CoV016) 1,400mg together significantly reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths (\"events\") in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.", "content": "<p>US pharma major Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) yesterday announced new data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled BLAZE-1 Phase III study, demonstrating bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700mg and etesevimab (LY-CoV016) 1,400mg together significantly reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths (\"events\") in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>\n<p>These results provide additional efficacy and safety data that support the use of the dose recently granted both Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration and a positive scientific opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), said Lilly.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, the EMA today announced that it has started a &lsquo;rolling review&rsquo; of data on the antibodies cocktail of bamlanivimab and etesevimab to be used in combination for the treatment of COVID-19. The review will also look at bamlanivimab used alone.</p>\n<h2><strong>87% risk reduction</strong></h2>\n<p>This new Phase III cohort of BLAZE-1 included 769 high-risk patients, aged 12 and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 (therapy: n=511; placebo: n=258). There were four events in patients taking bamlanivimab with etesevimab and 15 events in patients taking placebo, representing an 87% risk reduction (p&lt;0.0001).</p>\n<p>Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together also demonstrated statistically-significant improvements on key secondary endpoints. These results are consistent with those seen in other data sets from BLAZE-1: in the previous Phase III cohort, bamlanivimab 2,800mg with etesevimab 2,800mg reduced the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by 70% and in the Phase II cohort, bamlanivimab alone reduced the risk of hospitalizations and ER visits by approximately 70%. The viral load reductions were also consistent with what was observed in the previous Phase III cohort of the study.</p>\n<p>In this new Phase III cohort, there were four deaths total, all of which were deemed related to COVID-19 and all of which occurred in patients taking placebo; no deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. Across the two Phase III cohorts of the study that have been analyzed to date, there have been no deaths in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, and 14 deaths in patients receiving placebo, 13 of which were deemed COVID-19 related. In this data set, the safety profile of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together was consistent with observations from other Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials evaluating these antibodies.</p>\n<p>\"These positive results reinforce our previous findings and support the authorized dose of bamlanivimab 700mg with etesevimab 1,400 mg. These compelling data &ndash; in addition to the recent EUA from FDA, the CHMP decision from EMA and the recommendation for the therapy in the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines &ndash; give healthcare providers additional information regarding the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a potentially life-saving treatment to help those most at risk for severe complications of COVID-19,\" said Dr Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, adding: \"The consistent results observed in multiple cohorts of this trial over several months, even as new strains of COVID-19 have emerged, indicate bamlanivimab with etesevimab maintains its effects against a range of variants, particularly those circulating in the US.\"</p>", "date": "2021-03-11 15:50:00", "meta_title": "Positive Phase III results for Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab for", "meta_keywords": "Eli Lilly, Antibody cocktail, Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab, Phase III, COVID-19, Risk reduction", "meta_description": "Positive Phase III results for Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab for early COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-11 15:49:42", "updated": "2021-03-11 16:00:08", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-phase-iii-results-for-lilly-s-bamlanivimab-and-etesevimab-for-early-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eli_lilly_hq_large.jpg", "image2id": "eli_lilly_hq_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly", "drug_tag": "bamlanivimab, etesevimab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-11 15:50:00"}
