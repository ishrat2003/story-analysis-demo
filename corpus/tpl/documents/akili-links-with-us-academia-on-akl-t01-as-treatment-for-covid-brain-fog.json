There are currently no approved treatments for cognitive impairments in COVID-19 survivors.</p>\n<p>Under each collaboration, Akili, a PureTech Health (Nasdaq: PRTC) founded entity, will work with research teams at each institution to conduct two separate randomized, controlled clinical studies evaluating AKL-T01&rsquo;s ability to target and improve cognitive functioning in COVID-19 survivors who have exhibited a deficit in cognition. AKL-T01 is the first and only digital therapeutic specifically designed to improve attention function. The organizations aim to begin clinical recruitment for the studies in the next month.</p>\n<p>Since being named a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, clinicians continue to learn about the vast ways in which COVID-19 manifests in patients. Evidence is mounting on long-term neurological and cognitive symptoms that can persist in some COVID-19 patients after initial diagnosis, even after the virus is no longer detected in the body.</p>\n<p>A study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-021-00978-8\">published</a> in Neuropsychopharmacology led by Drs Abhishek Jaywant and Faith Gunning at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian found that difficulties in attention, multitasking, and processing speed were common in hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-. Of the patients in their study, 81%&nbsp;exhibited some degree of cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p>Recent research also shows these cognitive impairments may persist post-hospitalization and commonly occur in &ldquo;post-COVID long haulers&rdquo; or &ldquo;long COVID&rdquo; patients. These impairments can have a significant impact on survivors&rsquo; daily functioning and quality of life, impacting the ability of most COVID-19 long haulers to work for six months or more according to a recent study.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-07 15:18:00", "meta_title": "Akili links with US academia on AKL-T01 as treatment for \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID brain", "meta_keywords": "Akili Interactive, US academia, AKL-T01, Weill Cornell, Vanderbilt University, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID brain fog\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "meta_description": "Akili links with US academia on AKL-T01 as treatment for \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID brain fog\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-07 15:16:28", "updated": "2021-04-07 15:28:43", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/akili-links-with-us-academia-on-akl-t01-as-treatment-for-covid-brain-fog", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "akili_large.png", "image2id": "akili_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Digital Pharma, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Akili Interactive, PureTech Health", "drug_tag": "AKL-T01", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-07 15:18:00"}
