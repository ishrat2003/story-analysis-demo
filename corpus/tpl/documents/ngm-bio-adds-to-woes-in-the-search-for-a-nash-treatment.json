The study did not meet its primary endpoint evaluating a dose response showing improvement in liver fibrosis by <u>&gt;</u>1 stage with no worsening of NASH at week 24 (p=0.55), analyzed using a dose response-driven statistical analysis plan (Multiple Comparison Procedure Modeling, or MCP-Mod). The study did achieve statistical significance versus placebo on certain secondary endpoints, including NASH resolution (at the 3mg dose) and multiple non-invasive measures of NASH, including liver fat content reduction by MRI-PDFF, ALT, AST and Pro-C3 (at the 1mg and 3mg doses).</p>\n<p>This is in strong contrast to the preliminary Phase II results reported early last year, when aldafermin was seen to be the first drug to demonstrate a robust, statistically-significant effect of greater than 20% of patients achieving the Food and Drug Administration composite regulatory endpoint of fibrosis improvement and resolution of NASH versus placebo, as well as show an impressive impact on both of these endpoints independently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These results are certainly disappointing, particularly given the dire unmet need in this patient population. The lack of significant fibrosis improvement was unexpected given the consistency of histology findings previously seen with aldafermin in our adaptive four-cohort Phase II study,&rdquo; said David Woodhouse, chief executive at NGM. &ldquo;However, in line with the data from that study, ALPINE 2/3 achieved statistical significance on multiple non-invasive measures of NASH at the two higher doses. That said, given the failure to meet the primary endpoint, we have decided to shift resources that had previously been reserved for a Phase III F2/F3 NASH development program toward advancing our other programs,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>NGM has steadily expanded that pipeline</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr Woodhouse further commented: &ldquo;NGM is a markedly different company than when we initiated ALPINE 2/3 in May 2019, when our clinical-stage pipeline consisted primarily of liver and metabolic programs. Over the past two years, we have steadily expanded that pipeline with programs generated from our productive in-house discovery engine, and today we are also an ophthalmology and oncology company with four Phase II programs underway. We look forward to advancing our clinical programs and moving additional programs into the clinic, supported by our cash balance that was in excess of $400 million at the end of the first quarter.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2015, NGM entered into an up to $4850 million collaboration with US pharma giant Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) to research, discover, develop and commercialize biologics including NP201, which was being evaluated for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Merck made an upfront payment to NGM of $94 million and purchased a 15% equity stake in NGM for $106 million.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 11:57:00", "meta_title": "NGM Bio adds to woes in the search for a NASH treatment", "meta_keywords": "NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Aldafermin, Phase IIb, NASH, Non-alcoholic, Steatohepatitis", "meta_description": "NGM Bio adds to woes in the search for a NASH treatment", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 11:56:05", "updated": "2021-05-25 12:05:02", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ngm-bio-adds-to-woes-in-the-search-for-a-nash-treatment", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ngm_biopharma_large.jpg", "image2id": "ngm_biopharma_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "NGM Biopharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "aldafermin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 11:57:00"}
