This vaccine molecule subtype received its first approvals in 2020. Two J&amp;J Ebola vaccines were approved by the European Medicines Agency, and one COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, was approved in Russia.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Struggle began even before the latest vaccine approvals</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">&ldquo;Even before the approval of recombinant vector vaccines, the pharma industry was struggling to manufacture sufficient viral vectors to meet the needs of the handful of marketed gene therapies and growing number of clinical trials. Manufacturing these viruses is a relatively lengthy manufacturing process that is burdensome in terms of equipment and staffing,&rdquo; commented Fiona Barry, GlobalData associate editor, PharmaSource.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">There are 14 gene therapies and recombinant vector vaccines approved and marketed in the European Union, Japan, USA, or UK.

Clinical trials for these therapies are further impacting this capacity crunch. The biopharma industry is working to address the shortage through expanding facilities and improving processes, GlobalData noted.</span></p>", "date": "2021-03-25 15:52:00", "meta_title": "AstraZeneca and J&J face viral vector shortages for COVID-19 vaccines,", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, COVID-19, Vaccines, Recombinant, Viral vectors, Shortages, GlobalData", "meta_description": "AstraZeneca and J&J face viral vector shortages for COVID-19 vaccines, says analyst", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 15:51:32", "updated": "2021-03-25 16:02:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astrazeneca-and-j-j-face-viral-vector-shortages-for-covid-19-vaccines-says-analyst", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "coronavirus_structure_large.jpg", "image2id": "coronavirus_structure_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Production", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, GlobalData, Johnson & Johnson", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-25 15:52:00"}
