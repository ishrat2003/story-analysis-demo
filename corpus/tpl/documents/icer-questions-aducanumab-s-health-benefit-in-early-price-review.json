This preliminary draft marks the midpoint of the ICER&rsquo;s iterative process of assessing the evidence on aducanumab, and the ICER has stressed that these findings should not be interpreted as its final conclusions.</p>\n<p>David Rind, ICER&rsquo;s chief medical officer, said: &ldquo;Nearly everyone has been touched by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease through its effects on family members, friends, colleagues, or themselves.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is a condition that people dread like no other, and the first therapy that effectively cures or stops the progression of the disease will warrant a very high price in the US health system.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;However, the clinical trial history and evidence regarding aducanumab are complex, and we believe that at the current time the evidence remains insufficient to determine whether the drug provides an overall health benefit. This is an area of tremendous unmet need, but this treatment has important side effects, and its wide use would have important ramifications for patients and health care budgets, making it all the more important that we know whether a therapy like aducanumab is, or is not, effective.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Although the ICER&rsquo;s preliminary judgment is that substantial uncertainty remains regarding the health benefits of aducanumab, a base-case cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the combined results from the two contradictory Phase III randomized trials.</p>\n<p>Results showed estimates of small overall health gains commensurate with value-based prices at traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds between $2,500 and $8,300 per year.</p>\n<p>The report also includes draft calculations for multiple additional scenarios based on differing assumptions about the data on effectiveness of treatment. If the evidence is judged as suggesting no health benefit for aducanumab, then its value-based price would be $0. In the optimistic scenario, which only considers the favorable pivotal trial and disregards the negative study, the health gains for patients could support an annual price for aducanumab between $11,100 and $23,100.</p>\n<p>The ICER also calculated what a fair price would be for a hypothetical chronic maintenance therapy that halted the progression of dementia but did not cure Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>\n<p>Although the budget impact would be considerable for Medicare and other US payers due to the large potential patient population, such a treatment could be priced between $50,000 and $70,000 per year and still meet commonly cited thresholds for long-term cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://depositphotos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">DepositPhotos</a></p>", "date": "2021-05-06 12:46:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "aducanumab, health, clinical, ICER, evidence, treatment, disease, review, price, draft, important, benefit, report, assessing, Alzheimers, effectiveness", "meta_description": "The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has released a draft evidence report assessing the comparative clinical effectiveness and value of aducanu", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-06 12:27:16", "updated": "2021-05-06 12:47:49", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-questions-aducanumab-s-health-benefit-in-early-price-review", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "brain_alzheimer_credit_depositphotos_large.jpg", "image2id": "brain_alzheimer_credit_depositphotos_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Biogen, Eisai", "drug_tag": "aducanumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-06 12:46:00"}
