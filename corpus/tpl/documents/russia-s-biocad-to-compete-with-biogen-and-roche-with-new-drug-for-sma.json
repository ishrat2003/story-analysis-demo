{"contentid": 488324, "importid": NaN, "name": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biocad to compete with Biogen and Roche with new drug for SMA", "introduction": "Russian drugmaker Biocad says it has completed one of the stages of development of its new drug, which is designed for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), reports The Pharma Letter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s local correspondent.", "content": "<p>Russian drugmaker Biocad says it has completed one of the stages of development of its new drug, which is designed for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s local correspondent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the first drug of such kind produced in Russia. It is known as ANB-4, and the company has been working on its development since the beginning of 2018. The drug has previously shown its efficiency in animals with SMA, and the company is now conducting its clinical and pre-clinical trials already in the short-term.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As an official spokesman of Biocad said in an interview with Forbes Russia magazine, pre-clinical studies of the drug have already begun, while their task was to clarify the optimal dosage of the drug and study its possible toxicity.</p>\n<p>The company plans to complete pre-clinical trials of the drug this year, after which its clinical trials will begin.</p>\n<p>Most of these trials be carried out in children with type 1 SMA, which is the most severe form of the disease. Half of these children do not live more than10 months, and another 25% die before 13.6 months. The proportion of patients with type 1 SMA is about 60%. It is planned to include children under 6 months of age in clinical trials.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Using a viral vector, we add the SMN1 gene to cells where it was previously damaged, thereby saving cells from death for many years and preventing the development of SMA,&rdquo; explains Dmitry Madera, head of the ANB-4 Biocad&rsquo;s development team.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Biocad&rsquo;s drug to be cheaper than existing therapies</strong></h2>\n<p>The company predicts that its new drug will be cheaper than existing analogues, but does not name its approximate price.</p>\n<p>There are few drugs available for treating SMA in the market. The first was the Spinraza (nusinersen) from the American company Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB). The cost of the first year of the therapy with the drug is about 45 million roubles ($579,000), while for the second year and subsequent years it is 20 million roubles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, another drug is Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) from Novartis (NOVN: VX). The drug has recently appeared in the market and has already been approved in several countries, being priced at $2.125 million. This is the most expensive drug in the world, which because of its price, got into the Guinness Book of Records. A single application is enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is also a drug called Evrisdi (risdiplam) from the Swiss pharma giant Roche. Only Spinraza and Evrisdi are registered in Russia.</p>\n<p>With regard to Biocad, the company has given no indication about the planned launch of its drug.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Path to market approval</strong></h2>\n<p>According to analysts, the entire path from the creation of a drug molecule to its registration on the market usually takes five to 10 years, and can be interrupted at any stage: of all substances involved in preclinical development and studies, only 2% become registered drugs. The rest are not effective enough or cause too severe side effects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this case, registration process can be carried out according to an accelerated scheme, and also, given the severity of the disease and the patient population, for ethical reasons, the first phase of the clinical trial can be combined with the second, which will also speed up the process of bringing the drug to the market.</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 11:52:00", "meta_title": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biocad to compete with Biogen a,nd Roche with new drug for SM", "meta_keywords": "Biocad, Development, ANB-4, Muscular atrophy, Spinal, Biogen, Roche, Novartis, Evrisdi, Spinraza, Zolgensma, SMA", "meta_description": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biocad to compete with Biogen and Roche with new drug for SMARussia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biocad to compete with Biogen and Roche with new drug for SMA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-13 11:50:15", "updated": "2021-04-13 12:15:57", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-biocad-to-compete-with-biogen-and-roche-with-new-drug-for-sma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biocad_large.jpg", "image2id": "biocad_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Spinal muscular atrophy", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Regulation, Research, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "Biocad, Biogen, Novartis, Roche", "drug_tag": "ANB-4, Risdiplam, Spinraza, Zolgensma", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 11:52:00"}
