The conclusion reached by the KOL was that a US Food and Drug Administration approval would not be surprising, along with meaningful clinical acceptance.</p>\n<p>Her concerns center on aspects of the data including the small sample size of the study, meaning long-term follow-up data and additional studies of larger sample size may be needed to demonstrate clinical significance of the treatment.</p>\n<p>The need for biomarker research to identify potential responders among patients was also cited as important by the KOL.</p>\n<h2>Safety not seen as a deterrent</h2>\n<p>Referring to the KOL, the RBC report states: &ldquo;She does not see the safety profile as a deterrent for approval or clinical uptake. She believes more data is needed to assess the potential for re-dosing, which could contribute to the upside of teplizumab&rsquo;s benefit and opportunity, in our view.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The KOL does not see a barrier from infusion logistics but believes payer coverage and reimbursement receptivity is important. The KOL believes that, if approved, teplizumab could see highly positive receptivity from the interest level she observed from colleagues and patient families, and sees 50% of her eligible patients requesting the treatment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She sees the current infrastructure of T1D clinics as capable of supporting the teplizumab launch and believes the infection risks from 14-day IV infusion could be overcome as the patient population remains small.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-22 17:47:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "teplizumab, Provention, patients, Bio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, data, skepticism, prospects, excitement, prevention, type, diabetes, at-risk, studied, assessed, odds, betting", "meta_description": "The odds for and against betting on Provention Bio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teplizumab, which is being studied in the prevention of type 1 diabetes (T1D) among at-risk patients, have ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-22 17:35:00", "updated": "2021-03-22 18:15:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/excitement-and-skepticism-at-prospects-of-provention-bio-s-teplizumab", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "provention-bio-large.jpg", "image2id": "provention-bio-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Provention Bio, RBC Capital Markets", "drug_tag": "teplizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-22 17:47:00"}
