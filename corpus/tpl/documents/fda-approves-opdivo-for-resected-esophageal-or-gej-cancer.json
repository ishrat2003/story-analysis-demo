{"contentid": 488693, "importid": NaN, "name": "FDA approves Opdivo for resected esophageal or GEJ cancer", "introduction": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another important indication for Opdivo (nivolumab, injection for intravenous use), this one for the adjuvant treatment of completely resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer with residual pathologic disease in patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).", "content": "<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another important indication for Opdivo (nivolumab, injection for intravenous use), this one for the adjuvant treatment of completely resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer with residual pathologic disease in patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).</p>\n<p>The approval, granted to US pharma major Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), is based on results from the Phase III CheckMate -577 trial that evaluated Opdivo (n=532) compared to placebo (n=262) in esophageal or GEJ cancer patients with residual pathologic disease following neoadjuvant CRT and complete resection. According to BMS, whose shares closed up 2.2% at $67.00 on the news yesterday, Opdivo is the first and only immunotherapy approved in this patient population.</p>\n<p>In the trial, among patients who received Opdivo, median disease-free survival (DFS) was twice as long as in those who received placebo (22.4 months [95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 16.6 to 34.0] compared to 11.0 months [95% CI: 8.3 to 14.3]). Opdivo reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 31% compared to placebo (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.85;&nbsp;P=0.0003).</p>\n<h2><strong>Opdivo could become a new standard of care in these patients</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers are aggressive tumor types that often require multiple approaches to address the disease, including chemotherapy, radiation and surgery,&rdquo; said Dr Ronan Kelly, director, Baylor Scott &amp; White Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center, and W W Caruth Jr Endowed Chair of Immunology at Baylor University Medical Center. &ldquo;Even after neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery, there may be a high risk of recurrence for patients who do not achieve a pathologic complete response. In the CheckMate -577 trial, we saw a doubling in median disease-free survival compared to placebo, which suggests that Opdivo could become a new standard of care for these patients. This is exciting news, providing renewed hope,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Esophageal and GEJ cancer patients with residual pathologic disease following neoadjuvant CRT and complete resection face a high risk of disease recurrence; however, the predominant option for these patients has been surveillance,&rdquo; said Adam Lenkowsky, senior vice president and general manager, US, Cardiovascular, Immunology, Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb, adding: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s news marks an important step for patients as well as meaningful progress toward our commitment to pioneering immunotherapy treatment options in&nbsp;earlier stages of disease where there is the potential to reduce the risk of recurrence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This application was reviewed under the FDA&rsquo;s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. The review was also conducted under the FDA&rsquo;s Project Orbis initiative, which enabled concurrent review by the health authorities in Australia, Canada and Switzerland.</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 10:34:00", "meta_title": "FDA approves Opdivo for resected esophageal or GEJ cancer", "meta_keywords": "Bristol Myers Squibb, Opdivo, Indication, Cancer, Esophageal, Gastroesophageal junction, GEJ", "meta_description": "FDA approves Opdivo for resected esophageal or GEJ cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 10:29:26", "updated": "2021-05-21 10:36:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-opdivo-for-resected-esophageal-or-gej-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "opdivo__bristol-myers_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "opdivo_bristol-myers_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb", "drug_tag": "Opdivo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 10:34:00"}
