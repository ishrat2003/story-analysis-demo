Tanezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody in a new class of medicines called nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors, which work in a different manner than currently available treatments such as opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other analgesics. In studies to date, tanezumab has not demonstrated a risk of addiction, misuse or dependence.</p>\n<p>Tanezumab has been under development for more than a decade and dogged by safety issues. The anti-nerve growth factor&rsquo;s past has been blighted by incidences of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis that led to a partial clinical hold.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will continue to work with FDA</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;While we are disappointed with today&rsquo;s outcome, we continue to believe that tanezumab has a positive benefit-risk profile for patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain for whom current treatments are ineffective or not appropriate. Many of these patients have exhausted available therapies, have not had a new class of medications available to them in more than a decade and are eager for new, non-opioid options,&rdquo; said Ken Verburg, tanezumab development team leader, Pfizer global product development. &ldquo;We will continue to work with the FDA as the agency continues its review of our application.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Advisory Committee&rsquo;s discussions were based on the Biologics License Application (BLA) currently under review by the FDA. The BLA includes data from 20 Phase I-III clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of tanezumab administered intravenously or SC in patients with OA, including three pivotal Phase III SC studies involving more than 4,500 patients with moderate-to-severe OA.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The dialogue during the open public forum of this week&rsquo;s Advisory Committee meeting reinforced the urgent need for innovation for people living with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain &ndash; many of whom cycle through three to four therapies each year without adequate relief. The unresolved pain can impact all aspects of their lives, creating physical, emotional, social and financial hardships,&rdquo; said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly Bio-Medicines.</p>", "date": "2021-03-26 12:00:00", "meta_title": "FDA joint adcom returns negative vote on tanezumab for osteo pain", "meta_keywords": "Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Tanezumab, Osteoporosis, Pain, FDA, Advisory Committees, Risk evaluation", "meta_description": "FDA joint adcom returns negative vote on tanezumab for osteo pain", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-26 11:59:24", "updated": "2021-03-26 17:42:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-joint-adcom-returns-negative-vote-on-tanezumab-for-osteo-pain", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fda_big.jpg", "image2id": "fda_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia, Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "tanezumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-26 12:00:00"}
