Topics covered include generic drug product development, submission and assessment of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and marketing and exclusivity.</p>\n<p>However, according to Eva Temkin, former FDA Acting Director for Policy at the Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars, the guidance is silent on important topics that have arisen over the last year and which will continue to be relevant in 2021.</p>\n<p>Ms Temkin, who recently joined law firm King &amp; Spalding as a partner with the FDA &amp; Life Sciences team, has co-authored a new alert on the FDA guidance. In the article, she discusses the areas that are covered by the guidance, but concludes:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, the COVID Q&amp;A guidance may be more notable for what it did not say than for what it said. The guidance talks about developing generic drugs and submitting ANDAs, but it is silent regarding the development of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products and the submission of 351(k) BLAs. Stakeholders are left to wonder whether the principles outlined in the COVID Q&amp;A Guidance can inform treatment of follow-on biologics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The guidance also stops short of saying whether, or how, loss of market exclusivity due to inspection-related delays amid Covid might be evaluated.</p>\n<p>Ms Temkin&rsquo;s full alert is available on the King &amp; Spalding website, <a href=\"https://www.kslaw.com/news-and-insights/development-of-biosimilar-and-interchangeable-biological-products-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-what-the-anda-guidance-left-unsaid\">here</a>.</p>", "date": "2021-04-26 16:33:00", "meta_title": "Former FDA official slams agency's guidance on drug reviews during COV", "meta_keywords": "FDA, Guidance, Drug reviews, COVID-19, Pandemic, Eva Temkin, King & Spalding, Criticized", "meta_description": "Former FDA official slams agency's guidance on drug reviews during COVID-19 pandemic", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-26 16:33:07", "updated": "2021-05-05 07:56:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/former-fda-official-slams-agency-s-guidance-on-drug-reviews-during-covid-19-pandemic", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fda_big.jpg", "image2id": "fda_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "KING & SPALDING LLP", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-26 16:33:00"}
