Importantly, there are no safety concerns or signals, and this does not tell us if the immune response will be affected. We hope to report these data in the coming months.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The researchers also noted that as the study data was recorded in participants aged 50 and above, there is a possibility such reactions may be more prevalent in younger age groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-13 12:46:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "schedules, study, reactions, data, Oxford-AstraZeneca, mixed, frequent, University, dose, COVID-, Mixing, vaccines, leads, shows, launched, investigate", "meta_description": "The University of Oxford-led Com-COV study \u00e2\u0080\u0093 launched to investigate alternating doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-13 12:27:21", "updated": "2021-05-13 12:46:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mixing-covid-19-vaccines-leads-to-more-frequent-reactions-study-shows", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "lab_biotech_research_vaccine_big.jpg", "image2id": "lab_biotech_research_vaccine_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Pfizer, University of Oxford", "drug_tag": "BNT162b2, Comirnaty, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-13 12:46:00"}
