By increasing PINK1 activity, Mitokinin aims to address the mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and progression.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Mitokinin will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and will continue developing its PINK1 activator program through completion of IND enabling studies for Mitokinin's lead compound.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Another throw of the PD dice</strong></h2>\n<p>The deal with Mitokinin is AbbVie&rsquo;s second try in the Parkinson&rsquo;s sector. However, in June last year it walked away from a February2019 collaboration with Voyager Therapeutics (Nasdaq: VYGR), shedding a gene therapy for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s and vectorized antibodies for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, respectively. That deal that could have been worth $1.5 billion to Voyager, albeit with just $65 million upfront.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We're thrilled to be working with the world-class neuroscience team at AbbVie to bring our PINK1 program forward,\" said Daniel de Roulet, co-founder and chief executive at Mitokinin. \"We look forward to executing on the collaborative research plan, and most of all, to developing much needed therapeutics for Parkinson's disease patients,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\"Mitokinin's breakthrough PINK1 approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of Parkinson's disease,\" said Michael Taylor, executive chairman of Mitokinin and operating partner at Mission BioCapital, noting: \"Our new relationship with AbbVie is key to continuing our development and potentially bringing this new class of therapeutics to patients.\"</p>", "date": "2021-03-03 15:10:00", "meta_title": "AbbVie picks up option to acquire Mitokinin and its PD candidate", "meta_keywords": "AbbVie, Mitokinin, Acquisition, Option, Collaboration, PINK1 compound, Parkinson's disease", "meta_description": "AbbVie picks up option to acquire Mitokinin and its PD candidate", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-03 15:08:52", "updated": "2021-03-03 15:19:27", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abbvie-picks-up-option-to-acquire-mitokinin-and-its-pd-candidate", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "abbvie_us_large.jpg", "image2id": "abbvie_us_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Deals, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Mitokinin", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-03 15:10:00"}
