The new Organon unit will register its common stock under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>\n<p>Merck first announced that it was planning to create a new pharmaceutical company with $6.5 billion in annual sales focused largely on women&rsquo;s health drugs - such as Nexplanon (etonogestrel implant), a long-acting contraceptive implant, and some off-patent medicines, in February.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Merck is confident that the spinoff will deliver significant benefits for both companies, better meet patient and customer needs and create value for Merck shareholders,&rdquo; said Rob Davis, executive vice president, global services, and chief financial officer, Merck.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The transaction will create two companies with enhanced strategic and operational focus, which is expected to result in accelerated growth, improved agility, simplified and more efficient operating models, and improved resource allocation. Merck and Organon will be well-positioned to pursue distinct strategic agendas that will drive each company&rsquo;s long-term success,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>Organon&rsquo;s vision is to create a better and healthier every day for every woman around the globe. Organon believes the journey to improve women&rsquo;s health is foundational to the gender equity it wants to see in its organization and in the strategic focus set for the company, which is why it intends to appoint this majority-female board of directors.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 15:31:00", "meta_title": "Merck progresses spinoff of Organon", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, Spinnoff, Women's health, Biosimilars, Organon, Nexplanon", "meta_description": "Merck progresses spinoff of Organon", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 15:30:09", "updated": "2021-03-18 15:39:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-progresses-spinoff-of-organon", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "merck_co_large.png", "image2id": "merck_co_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Women's health", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Management", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co, Organon", "drug_tag": "Nexplanon", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 15:31:00"}
