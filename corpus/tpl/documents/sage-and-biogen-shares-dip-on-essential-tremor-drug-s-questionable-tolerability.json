The trial evaluated treatment of SAGE-324 at the higher end of the dose range and the daily dose could be down-titrated to 45mg or 30mg if 60mg was not well tolerated. Down-titration of dose occurred in 62% of patients who received SAGE-324 and discontinuations were noted in 38%.</p>\n<p>The companies sought to focus on SAGE-324&rsquo;s impact in reducing tremor in offering their reactions.</p>\n<h2>'Extraordinary unmet need'</h2>\n<p>Alfred Sandrock, head of research and development at Biogen, said: &ldquo;We are encouraged by the positive results of the KINETIC Study, which indicate that SAGE-324 may provide relief in people suffering with essential tremor, a movement disorder that affects an estimated 6.4 million people &ndash; and is one of the most common movement disorders &ndash; in the USA.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For people with essential tremor, uncontrollable shaking of the hands, head, voice, or legs can create difficulty eating, dressing, writing, and pursuing other day-to-day tasks. It is our hope that, in collaboration with Sage, we will be able to deliver an innovative and meaningful new treatment option for these patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rodger Elble, a neurologist at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, added: &ldquo;There is an extraordinary unmet need for people suffering with essential tremor, a condition that can cause significant disability in patients.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The only approved medicine was developed more than 50 years ago, and most medicines used for ET were developed for other conditions, and their benefits to people with ET were only discovered serendipitously. Current investigational drugs like SAGE-324, if successful, may offer potential for new treatment options for tremor management, as more than 50% of people with ET do not respond optimally to the current standard of care.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 12:14:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "tremor, essential, SAGE-, Biogen, Sage, Nasdaq, people, companies, tolerability, patients, treatment, shares, drug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, questionable, study, closed, BIIB", "meta_description": "Both companies in the CNS partnership of Sage Therapeutics (Nasdaq: SAGE) and Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) closed more than 2% lower on Monday.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-13 11:34:22", "updated": "2021-04-13 12:15:41", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sage-and-biogen-shares-dip-on-essential-tremor-drug-s-questionable-tolerability", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sage-large.jpg", "image2id": "sage-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Biogen, Sage Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "SAGE-324", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 12:14:00"}
