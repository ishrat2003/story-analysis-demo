ASCLEPIOS trials of Kesimpta (ofatumumab).", "content": "<p>Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) has announced new post hoc data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials of Kesimpta (ofatumumab).</p>\n<p>The data will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), being held virtually between April 17 and April 22.</p>\n<p>Novartis said the results further support Kesimpta as a first-choice treatment option for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).</p>\n<h2>Kesimpta development</h2>\n<p>Approved in the USA in August 2020, Kesimpta is the first targeted B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home, via the Sensoready autoinjector pen.</p>\n<p>The drug is being developed and marketed globally under a license agreement with Danish biotech firm Genmab (Nasdaq: GMAB).</p>\n<p>With a patient-friendly mode of administration, Novartis hopes to be able to distinguish its option from Roche&rsquo;s (ROG: SIX) intravenous Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), another anti-CD20 antibody, which analysts expect to be market leader in coming years.</p>\n<p>One obstacle for Novartis may be price, with the wholesale cost of the product reported to be over $80,000, more expensive than Ocrevus.</p>\n<p>The European Medicines Agency approved Kesimpta for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features on March 30, 2021, while other regulatory submissions are underway globally.</p>\n<p>Ofatumumab is also already approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which indication it is marketed under the trade name Arzerra.</p>\n<h2>AAN presentation</h2>\n<p>The new analysis shows Kesimpta reduced the risk of disability progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) at three and six months, compared with teriflunomide.</p>\n<p>Teriflunomide is developed by French pharma major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN), and is sold under the brand name Aubagio.</p>\n<p>The analysis relates to a subgroup of people with RMS who were newly diagnosed and had not been treated before.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Novartis said that PIRA was &ldquo;an emerging endpoint used in MS trials to measure disability worsening independent of relapses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Estelle Vester-Blokland, global head of neuroscience medical affairs at Novartis, said: &ldquo;Evidence shows that progression occurs in people living with MS in the early stages of disease.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She added: &ldquo;This reinforces the need to treat early with a first-choice treatment like Kesimpta, which combines powerful efficacy with a favorable safety profile and can be self-administered at home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>All abstracts will be published in the journal Neurology following the meeting.</p>", "date": "2021-04-16 13:21:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "data, attest, benefits, Kesimpta", "meta_description": "Swiss pharma giant Novartis
