The Commission&rsquo;s opinion reversed Chief Administrative Law Judge D Michael Chappell&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/05/administrative-law-judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint\">initial decision</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Barred from entering into any type of reverse payment deal</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission&rsquo;s final order bars Impax from entering into any type of reverse payment that defers or restricts generic entry, including no-Authorized Generic commitments, as well as certain business transactions entered with the branded pharmaceutical manufacturer within 45 days of a patent settlement. The order also bars Impax from entering any agreement with another oxymorphone ER manufacturer that prevents or restricts competition between oxymorphone ER products.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, the FTC filed an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/endo-pharmaceuticals-inc-agrees-abandon-anticompetitive-pay-delay\">administrative complaint against Impax</a>, charging that in 2010, Impax and Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. illegally agreed that Impax would not compete by marketing a generic version of Endo&rsquo;s Opana ER until January 2013. In exchange, Endo paid Impax more than $112 million. Then again in January 2021, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/ftc-again-charges-endo-impax-illegally-preventing-competition-us\">Commission charged Endo and Impax</a>, and Impax&rsquo;s owner Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with illegally eliminating competition in the market for oxymorphone ER. That case is pending before the US District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 15:03:00", "meta_title": "US appeals court upholds FTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion against Impax Labs", "meta_keywords": "Endo Pharmaceuticals, Impax Laboratories, Opana ER, FTC, Determination, Upheld, Appeals court, Opioids, Reverse payments", "meta_description": "US appeals court upholds FTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion against Impax Labs", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 14:58:50", "updated": "2021-04-14 15:11:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-appeals-court-upholds-ftc-s-opinion-against-impax-labs", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "federal_trade_commission_big.png", "image2id": "federal_trade_commission_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Federal Trade Commission", "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia", "topic_tag": "Deals, Focus On, Legal", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Impax Laboratories", "drug_tag": "Opana ER, Prescription Opioid", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 15:03:00"}
