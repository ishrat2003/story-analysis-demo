Treatment with Zofin will take place at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). The approval by regulators is contingent on the strict adherence to the dosing protocols in use by clinical trial investigators conducting Organicell&rsquo;s ongoing Phase I/II trial for COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zofin is an acellular, biologic therapeutic derived from perinatal sources and is manufactured to retain naturally occurring microRNAs, without the addition or combination of any other substance or diluent.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Also approved for broader trial</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to this compassionate grounds authorization, Organicell has received further authorization to begin a broader trial of Zofin with up to 60 additional patients suffering from moderate to severe COVID. The company has already shared data with regulatory authorities in the country in support of this effort and hopes to come to an arrangement and commence this trial in the near future.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Organicell is dedicated to helping those who suffer from COVID-19 and are hopeful that Zofin0. can continue to help these patients in Pakistan,&rdquo; said Albert Mitrani, chief executive of Organicell. &ldquo;Starting with this first patient who will be treated on compassionate grounds, we are eager for this opportunity to begin the trial which hopefully will lead to a fast authorization of Zofin to be used as the COVID-19 treatment protocol,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Zofin is currently being tested in a Phase I/II randomized, double blinded, placebo trial to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of intravenous infusion of Zofin for the treatment of moderate to SARS related to COVID-19 infection versus placebo.</p>\n<p>In April this year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for Organicell&rsquo;s Zofin, in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.
