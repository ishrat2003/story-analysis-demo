So, despite the real difficulty that we are seeing in India, vaccination could be an especially important antidote against this,\" said Dr Fauci.</p>\n<p>Developed by India's Bharat Biotech in partnership with the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3, while still in clinical trial. Later, trial results showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78%, for its ability to neutralize the B.1.617 variant, according to ICMR.</p>\n<p>The B.1.617 variant, mostly found in COVID cases in Maharashtra and Delhi, has three new spike protein mutations. This variant is said to be pushing the deadly second COVID surge across India.</p>\n<p>Dr Fauci also said that the world has failed to get together and help India avert the mammoth COVID crisis it is witnessing.</p>\n<p>This, despite India's own vaccine diplomacy - India decided to ship out doses of the novel coronavirus vaccine to 'neighboring and key partner countries', with its vaccine diplomacy reaching 17 nations, including neighboring countries as well as those in West Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>\n<p>India had earlier supplied hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir and paracetamol tablets, as well as ventilators, masks, and other medical supplies to a large number of countries to help them deal with the pandemic.</p>\n<p>As part of the GAVI-COVAX alliance, India is to supply 10 million doses to Africa and 1 million to UN health workers.</p>\n<h2><strong>USA help being provided&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Given India&rsquo;s growing strategic importance, its rising wave of infections risks the fledgling recovery in Asia&rsquo;s third-largest economy. The nation is now termed the main hotspot of the pandemic, despite being home to the world&rsquo;s largest vaccine manufacturer.</p>\n<p>On April 27, the USA said that it remembers 'India's generosity' in the early days of the pandemic and has decided to roll out a series of supportive measures to help India&rsquo;s fight against the COVID-19 upsurge.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration&rsquo;s announcement was a dramatic policy U-turn and came after a tumultuous week in which the administration&rsquo;s carefully constructed pandemic-diplomacy plan fell apart as the COVID-19 crisis in India worsened.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With pressure mounting on the US to give out vaccines to countries such as India, which is in the throes of a massive COVID-19 outbreak, the Biden administration maintained that the Indian government did not request it for ready-to-use vaccines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For some time now US lawmakers and other influential voices have been calling for the US to donate its spare vaccines to countries like India, particularly some of the tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) vaccine.</p>\n<p>However, the Biden's administration has assured that India will be supplied with raw materials required by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) to ramp up the production of Covishield vaccines and has also identified supplies of other therapeutics that are to be immediately made available for India.</p>\n<p>The tweets by Biden and Harris were the first reactions by the top American leadership after the recent outbreak of the pandemic in India. The two have been criticized by friends of India in the USA, including some of their own party leaders, for the slow response of American help to their natural ally.</p>\n<p>Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna, and Member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the administration should also call on US pharma giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and biotech Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with the COVID-19 crisis. It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets, he added.</p>\n<p>Others have argued the Biden administration needs to demonstrate a more agile approach in managing the pandemic globally and in navigating the domestic politics of foreign policy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Help at hand</strong></h2>\n<p>Chief executives of 40 top American companies have come together to create a global task force and mobilize resources to India. The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is also funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE, a Hyderabad-based firm, to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the USA is deploying an expert team of public health advisors from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work in close collaboration with the US Embassy, India&rsquo;s health ministries, and India&rsquo;s Epidemic Intelligence Service staff.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>USAID will also quickly work with the CDC to support and fast-track the mobilization of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund. The USA has also decided to lift its embargo on the export of raw materials required by the Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce Covishield, as requested by SII CEO Adar Poonawall.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Export curbs</strong></h2>\n<p>In February, the USA invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the power to control the distribution of products, to curb the export of raw materials critical for vaccine production.</p>\n<p>USA blocked export because, in November last year, Pfizer cut short its vaccine production target by half, citing a shortage of raw material. Pfizer, which is producing mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, had earlier planned to roll out over 1.2 billion shots in 2021, but reduced the target by half due to raw material shortage in the USA and Europe.</p>\n<p>Also, UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has gone on record to state that SII, India's main vaccine maker, is \"making and producing more doses of vaccine than any other single organization.\"</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 10:10:00", "meta_title": "Aiding India's vaccine efforts - diplomatically", "meta_keywords": "India, COVID-19, Vaccines, Support, Pandemic, Biden administration, Bharat Biotech, Covaxin, Remdesivir, Serum Institute of India, AstraZeneca, Pfizer", "meta_description": "Aiding India's vaccine efforts - diplomatically", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-03 11:20:33", "updated": "2021-05-04 10:10:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/aiding-india-s-vaccine-efforts-diplomatically", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "india_flag_big.jpg", "image2id": "india_flag_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Public health", "geography_tag": "India, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, Covaxin, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 10:10:00"}
