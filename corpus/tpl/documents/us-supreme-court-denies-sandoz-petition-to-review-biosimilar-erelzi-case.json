Erelzi has been approved in the US for more than four years, since August 2016, however Sandoz has been unable to launch this medicine in the USA due to the patent litigation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sandoz to strengthen its antibiotics manufacturing setup in Europe</strong></h2>\n<p>Sandoz today also announced it will further strengthen its European antibiotics manufacturing network by further expanding production capabilities in Kundl, Austria and in Palafolls, Spain. By modernizing and simplifying its manufacturing setup, Sandoz will improve its ability to consistently deliver high-quality medicines to patients, while remaining cost-competitive on the global market.</p>\n<p>In line with plans announced with the Austrian government in July 2020, Sandoz confirms that in a first step it will proceed to invest more than 100 million euros ($121 million) to introduce new manufacturing technology for the production of oral amoxicillin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for its leading penicillin product. This investment will allow Sandoz to leverage its position in Kundl as the hub and center of the only major end-to-end antibiotics supply chain in Europe, covering all production steps from API to Finished Dosage Forms (FDF) for many leading antibiotics.</p>\n<p>In addition to the investment in Kundl, Sandoz announces plans for an expansion of its Palafolls site in Spain, planning to invest around 50 million euros in new production technology and increased capacity for the production of sterile penicillin APIs and sterile API mixtures.</p>\n<p>As part of this network modernization plan, Sandoz will phase out the current production of oral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) at the Les Franqueses site in Spain, which it plans to close in 2024. Sterile API production is planned to transfer from Kundl to the new facility at Palafolls in 2025.</p>", "date": "2021-05-18 10:46:00", "meta_title": "US Supreme Court denies Sandoz petition to review biosimilar Erelzi ca", "meta_keywords": "Sandoz, Erelzi, Biosimilar, Enbrel Amgen, Patents, Supreme Court, Manufacturing, Antibiotics, Europe, Austria, Spain", "meta_description": "US Supreme Court denies Sandoz petition to review biosimilar Erelzi case", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-18 10:45:31", "updated": "2021-05-18 10:55:22", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-supreme-court-denies-sandoz-petition-to-review-biosimilar-erelzi-case", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sandoz-logo-big.jpg", "image2id": "sandoz-logo-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars, Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Antibiotics", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Legal, Patents & Trademarks, Production", "geography_tag": "Europe, Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Amgen, Novartis, Sandoz", "drug_tag": "Enbrel, Erelzi", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-18 10:46:00"}
