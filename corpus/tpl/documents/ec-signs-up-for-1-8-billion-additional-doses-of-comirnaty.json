More than a year later, we continue to learn about COVID-19 and are working to determine if, similar to seasonal influenza, annual vaccination may provide the most enduring protection. We are proud to be in a position to be a long-term partner in the EU&rsquo;s fight against this devastating pandemic and remain steadfast in our commitment to potentially produce and deliver billions more doses of our vaccine each year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is growing evidence that COVID-19 will continue to pose a public health challenge for years. This contract with the European Commission will ensure sufficient doses of Comirnaty are available for all EU citizens in 2022 and 2023,&rdquo; said noted BioNTech CEO and co-founder Dr Ugur Sahin, adding: &ldquo;With these additional doses and our continued investments in research and development aimed at adapting our vaccine to address new and emerging variants, we will continue to make a significant impact in the EU&rsquo;s efforts to protect public health.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The distribution of Comirnaty by the EU member states will continue to be determined according to the populations identified in the EU and national guidance.
