Like the others, the American firm is testing its option in combination with a traditional checkpoint blocker, Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc).</p>\n<p>Both rivals are presenting data at ASCO in the form of a poster presentation on Friday, June 4, at 9am EDT.</p>\n<h3><strong>Novartis (NOVN: VX) - TNO155 - Friday, June 4, 11am EDT.</strong></h3>\n<p>In an oral presentation, Swiss pharma major Novartis is presenting initial results from a dose finding study of its SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, in people with advanced solid tumors.</p>\n<p>The company has highlighted the candidate for its potential as part of a broad combination strategy for KRAS G12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors.</p>\n<p>While the therapy is advancing in clinical trials, analysts will pay close attention to a rival option from Revolution Medicines (Nasdaq: RVMD), RMC-4630.</p>\n<p>The Californian company has already conducted early-stage clinical research featuring a combo of its investigational SHP2 blocker with the leading checkpoint blocker on the market, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), and is moving forward apace.</p>\n<p>In the firm's initial research, investigators have reported preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in people with colorectal cancer driven by KRAS mutations, setting up the potential for rivalry with Novartis' TNO155 development program.</p>\n<h3><strong>Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) - amcenestrant - Friday, June 4, 9am EDT.</strong></h3>\n<p>French pharma major Sanofi believes the early amcenestrant data on display at ASCO this year support its potential to become a new endocrine backbone therapy for ER+/HER2- breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Extra attention has been paid to the program since chief executive Paul Hudson described the compound as one of his firm&rsquo;s leading growth drivers for the future.</p>\n<p>Amcenestrant is an oral therapy known as a selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, or SERD, under evaluation in combination with Pfizer&rsquo;s NYSE: PFE) Ibrance (palbociclib), in the Phase I/II AMEERA-1 study.</p>\n<p>In a poster session on Friday, the company will detail an objective response rate (ORR) of 34% and a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 74% in combination with Ibrance, a CDK4/6 inhibitor.</p>\n<p>Sarat Chandarlapaty, medical oncologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said the early clinical data &ldquo;show that the combination of amcenestrant with palbociclib achieved encouraging antitumor activity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Noting an encouraging safety profile, Dr Chandarlapaty added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s notable to see this kind of activity in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a clear need for new therapeutic options.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sanofi is not alone in pursuing SERDs, a therapeutic avenue which analysts at Jefferies believe has the potential for up to $3 billion in revenues.</p>\n<p>Swiss company Roche (ROG: SIX) has been investing in this area for many years, with current frontrunner, RG6171, in late-stage testing.</p>\n<p>Also worth looking out for is elacestrant, from Radius Health (Nasdaq: RDUS), which is also in late-stage testing and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) AZD9833, noteworthy for the company&rsquo;s pedigree in this area.</p>\n<h2>Other selected highlights</h2>\n<p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> - Final results from Phase II DESTINY-CRC01 study of trastuzumab deruxtecan in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) - Monday, June 7, 1.15 EDT</p>\n<p><strong>AstraZeneca and Merck &amp;
