BridgeBio&rsquo;s shares edged up a modest 2.6% to $60.64 by late morning on the news.</p>\n<p>Infigratinib is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to inhibit FGFR, and being investigated for treatment of individuals with FGFR-driven conditions, including cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), urothelial carcinoma (urinary tract and bladder cancer), and other FGFR-driven cancers.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the deal, BridgeBio will retain all rights to infigratinib in skeletal dysplasia, including achondroplasia. Subject to US Food and Drug Administration approval, QED and Helsinn will co-commercialize infigratinib in oncology indications in the USA and will share profits and losses on a 50:50 basis. Helsinn will have exclusive commercialization rights and lead commercialization for infigratinib in non-skeletal dysplasia indications outside of the USA, excluding China, Hong Kong and Macau, which are covered by BridgeBio&rsquo;s strategic development and commercialization collaboration with LianBio.</p>\n<h2><strong>Deal provides $100 million upfront</strong></h2>\n<p>BridgeBio says it is eligible to receive around $2.45 billion, including over $100 million in upfront, regulatory and launch milestone payments, and the remainder subject to the achievement of specified commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties in the high teens as a percentage of adjusted net sales by Helsinn of the licensed products sold worldwide, outside of the USA and Greater China. The sharing of commercialization supports BridgeBio&rsquo;s mission to rapidly advance and deliver medicines to patients, while supporting its build out of its own commercial team.</p>\n<p>The FDA has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for infigratinib for patients with previously-treated advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) harboring an FGFR2 gene fusion or rearrangement. The NDA has been granted Priority Review designation and is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, an initiative of the FDA&rsquo;s Oncology Center of Excellence designed to expedite the delivery of safe and effective cancer treatments to patients. Additionally, infigratinib is currently under review in Australia and Canada under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA&rsquo;s Oncology Center of Excellence that allows for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international regulatory agencies.</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 16:45:00", "meta_title": "BridgeBio Pharma unit signs multi-billion-dollar deal with Helsinn", "meta_keywords": "BridgeBio Pharma, Helsinn, QED Therapeutics, Infigratinib, License, Agreement, Commercialization, Cancer, Bladder, Urinary,", "meta_description": "BridgeBio Pharma unit signs multi-billion-dollar deal with Helsinn", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 16:44:37", "updated": "2021-03-31 16:54:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bridgebio-pharma-unit-signs-multi-billion-dollar-deal-with-helsinn", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "bridgebio_large.png", "image2id": "bridgebio_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "BridgeBio Pharma, Helsinn Group, QED Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "infigratinib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 16:45:00"}
