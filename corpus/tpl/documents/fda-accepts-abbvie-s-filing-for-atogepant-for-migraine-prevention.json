AbbVie gained rights to atogepant along with its $63 billion acquisition of Allergan, which completed in May last year.</p>\n<p>The NDA is supported by data from a robust clinical program evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally-administered atogepant in nearly 2,500 patients who experience 4-14 migraine days per month including but not /limited to the pivotal Phase III ADVANCE study, the pivotal Phase IIb/III study, and the Phase III long-term safety study.</p>\n<h2><strong>Committed leader in migraine</strong></h2>\n<p>\"With the integration of Allergan, AbbVie is now a committed leader in migraine with an almost 25-year history in migraine research. We look forward to potentially adding a new treatment option to our portfolio that will help more people with migraine,\" said Dr Michael Gold, vice president, neuroscience development, AbbVie. \"We believe atogepant is an advancement with the potential to offer meaningful benefits as a safe, effective oral preventive treatment option. Despite the availability of other migraine treatment options, the medical community and people living with migraine recognize the unmet need of those who face the unpredictable and debilitating realities of this disease.\"</p>\n<p>In the migraine space, AbbVie markets Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), the first FDA-approved, preventive treatment for adults with chronic migraine that, despite generic competition, continues to hold out against rival options to a significant extent, bringing in billions of dollars in annual revenues. It also has in its portfolio Ubrelvy (ubrogepant), the first FDA-approved oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant), which is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.</p>\n<p>In the Phase III ADVANCE study, all active treatment arms of atogepant met their primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days over a 12-week treatment period. Also, the 30mg and 60mg doses met all six secondary endpoints with statistical significance. This study followed positive results from the Phase IIb/III study that met the same primary endpoint across all doses and dosing regimens. The Phase III long-term safety study evaluated safety and tolerability of 60mg oral atogepant administered daily over 52 weeks. The Phase III long-term safety study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting. Results from the Phase IIb/III study and the Phase III ADVANCE study were previously announced.</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 15:03:00", "meta_title": "FDA accepts AbbVie's filing for atogepant for migraine prevention", "meta_keywords": "AbbVie, Atogepant, Migraine, Prevention, NDA, Accepted, FDA, Botox, Ubrelvy", "meta_description": "FDA accepts AbbVie's filing for atogepant for migraine prevention", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 15:03:22", "updated": "2021-03-31 15:10:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-abbvie-s-filing-for-atogepant-for-migraine-prevention", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "abbvie_us_large.jpg", "image2id": "abbvie_us_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Migraine", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie", "drug_tag": "atogepant, Botox, Ubrelvy", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 15:03:00"}
