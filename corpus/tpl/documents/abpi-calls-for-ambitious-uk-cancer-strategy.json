As we look to cautiously and safely restart services that were restricted due to COVID-19, there is an opportunity to now do things differently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It will take the combined effort of every person in the cancer community working together to deliver high-quality, consistent care to NHS patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the charity Breast Cancer Now, said: &ldquo;When it comes to research and development, we&rsquo;re good at the &lsquo;R&rsquo; but not at the &lsquo;D&rsquo; in the UK and a large part of the reason for that is due to workforce and funding restraints. The government needs to have ambition to improve cancer outcomes through the implementation of research innovations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A shared concern among interviewees was the greater need for investment in the health service if the UK is to achieve better quality care for people with cancer. In 2018, the UK spent &pound;159 ($218) per person per year on cancer care, which is below the European average of &pound;176 and considerably less than countries of comparable size and wealth such as Germany and France.</p>", "date": "2021-03-25 12:46:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "cancer, care, ABPI, improving, outcomes, funding, ambitious, strategy, industry, patients, government, countries, diagnosis, calls, priority, Pharmaceutica", "meta_description": "The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) wants the UK government to make improving cancer outcomes a priority funding focus.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 12:37:56", "updated": "2021-03-25 13:56:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abpi-calls-for-ambitious-uk-cancer-strategy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "uk_london-1-.jpg", "image2id": "uk_london_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Cancer", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Government Affairs, Health Medical Pharma", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "ABPI", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-25 12:46:00"}
