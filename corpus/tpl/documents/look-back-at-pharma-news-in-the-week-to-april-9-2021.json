Editor</p>\n<p>In COVID-19 related news last week, Japan&rsquo;s Takeda and Australia&rsquo;s CSL Ltd reported that the project they are leading, dubbed CoVig-19 Plasma Alliance, had failed to meet Phase III goals, and is therefore concluded. AstraZeneca&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine, now called Vaxzevria, came under the spotlight last week regarding possible links to blood clots. On the regulatory front, Acadia Pharmaceuticals had a setback, as the US Food and Drug Administration issued a complete response letter (CRL) relating to its supplementary Biologics License (sBLA) for Nuplazid as a treatment for dementia-related psychosis. FibroGen revealed that some false data had been presented on its drug candidate roxadustat for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-associated anemia. Also, Provention Bio revealed problems with its regulatory filing for diabetes candidate teplizumab.</p>\n<h2><strong>Takeda, CSL Behring fold big plasma alliance after Ph III flop</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/covig-19-plasma-alliance-s-immunoglobulin-trial-misses-goals\">big plasma alliance</a> spearheaded by Takeda and CSL Behring has a big Phase III verdict: Adding their hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin product to Gilead&rsquo;s remdesivir does not stall disease progression, commented Amber Tong on EndPoints News.</p>\n<p>Dubbed CoVig, the treatment was supposed to be a higher-grade version of convalescent plasma, which former President Donald Trump once hailed as a &ldquo;historic breakthrough.&rdquo; But it seems to be following plasma down the same path toward obsolescence. Coming a year after the companies announced the partnership - which they called a bold move to find answers amid uncertainty - the failure would mark an end to their work, which had included manufacturing the product at-risk.</p>\n<p>The hospitalized patient population has been an elusive group for antibodies, defeating a slew of candidates from Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline/Vir and Brii Bio.</p>\n<p>Plasma from healthy donors who have recovered from Covid-19, meanwhile, has also had trouble living up to early expectations. The UK&rsquo;s RECOVERY trial stopped recruiting patients for its convalescent plasma arm after an independent data monitoring committee found no significant improvement in mortality.</p>\n<h2><strong>AstraZeneca needs to regain public trust on COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the news that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has confirmed a possible link between very rare cases of <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-finds-possible-link-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-with-rare-blood-clots\">unusual blood clots</a> after vaccination with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria, analytics firm GlobalData&rsquo;s senior pharma analyst Philipp Rosenbaum said that &ldquo;AstraZeneca has had its fair share of bad luck with its COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria, but a lack of communication in combination with uncoordinated and confusing decisions about who should get the vaccine from European politics has eroded the public trust in the vaccine. Now a clear message must be sent from European regulators and politicians and the company, that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risk of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the UK has now joined several EU countries in recommending Vaxzevria only to people below certain ages. However, with variants such as B.117 spreading rapidly through Europe, slowing the outbreak and reducing new COVID-19 cases will depend heavily on vaccination efforts; thus, continuation of existing vaccination programs is urgently needed to prevent more cases and deaths in vulnerable populations.</p>\n<p>However, Dr Rosenbaum said, in the long-term, having alternatives such as the mRNA vaccines and single dose vaccines, means that AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Vaxzevria will potentially only play a small role post-pandemic if repeat vaccinations for COVID-19 are needed. There will be enough alternatives, and countries with the needed resources might shift towards vaccines with better efficacy and safety data. In fact, the US is already donating stock of its AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccine will continue to play a significant role in the global fight against the pandemic, given that AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India, are planning to manufacture and distribute more than two billion doses of the vaccine at a low cost globally. However, the company and politicians must make sure that Vaxzevria will not been seen as the vaccine that can be distributed globally, while the US and European countries are trying to count on mRNA vaccines, possibly creating a two-class vaccine system,&rdquo; he concluded</p>\n<h2><strong>CRL for Acadia, as expected: FDA changed its mind</strong></h2>\n<p>Acadia received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/acadia-to-take-issue-with-fda-over-crl-for-nuplazid-sbla\">Nuplazid&rsquo;s sNDA filing</a> in dementia-related psychosis (DRP), which is not surprising given that on March 3 the FDA informed the company that it had identified deficiencies during the review, noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Mark Goodman. Management indicated that this is the first time that the FDA raised concerns about the HARMONY trial (Study 045) design and data analysis, as the CRL cited &ldquo;a lack of statistical significance in some of the subgroups of dementia, and insufficient numbers of patients with certain less common dementia subtypes as lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness to support approval.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is clearly disappointing news, as the criteria mentioned in the CRL were not among any of the prespecified requirements that were agreed upon previously with the FDA. It appears that the FDA has changed its mind with new leadership for the psychiatry division, and it&rsquo;s not clear what the FDA would need to see to approve a product for this indication. Acadia still believes it has robust clinical data based on its original agreed upon pivotal study design targeting a broad DRP population, and it plans to schedule a type A meeting with the FDA to defend its position and determine next steps. However, we think the likelihood of a reversal by the FDA is very low, and we assume that Acadia will need to do another study in DRP, which would delay a launch by several years.</p>\n<p>Management believes that it has demonstrated robust efficacy results from both the open-label phase and the randomized withdrawal phase with the pre-specified criteria, and it should be adequate to satisfy the FDA&rsquo;s requirements from the End-of-Phase 2 meeting that &ldquo;to rely on a single well-controlled study for your sNDA filing, the findings must be very persuasive&rdquo;, which means &ldquo; statistically significant with a very small probability of Type I error and a finding that is clinically meaningful.</p>\n<p>Also commenting of Evaluate Vantage, Madeleine Armstrong noted that fears are growing that the US regulator is becoming strict, and several examples of the agency playing hardball have been seen in 2021, the latest being Acadia.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is no bad thing. The FDA should not approve drugs without clear evidence of their efficacy and safety, and is arguably just doing its job by setting a high bar here.</p>\n<p>But Acadia is clearly aggrieved at what it believes were shifting goalposts. The Nuplazid CRL itself was not a surprise after the agency said last month that it had identified deficiencies in its filing; the surprise was that the FDA found fault with Acadia&rsquo;s Phase III trial, HARMONY &ndash; apparently changing&nbsp;its mind about this trial&rsquo;s design. This could be a worrying development for other biopharma groups, Ms Armstrong warned. Nerves will be jangling at other groups with questionable datasets and big approval decisions coming up. Biogen springs to mind.</p>\n<h2><strong>FibroGen stretches the bounds of credibility</strong></h2>\n<p>Fibrogen&rsquo;s claim that its anemia pill <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fibrogen-admits-false-safety-data-used-for-roxadustat\">roxadustat was safer than infused EPO agents</a>, for certain patients on dialysis, formed a big part the project&rsquo;s perceived value, according to Amy Brown writing on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>That value, already diminished by the company&rsquo;s opaque disclosure of complex datasets, was seriously dented again last Tuesday. Fibrogen&rsquo;s staggering admission of major data errors in previous presentations leaves roxadustat looking like a considerably weaker proposition. A hard line from regulators cannot be ruled out, even before considering what doctors will make of all this.</p>\n<p>The mistake concerns pooled <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/trial-results/roxadustat-moves-regulators\">safety data first presented back in 2019</a>at the American Society of Nephrology on roxadustat, which is being developed to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. At the time the company claimed that the findings cleared up doubt about Roxadustat&rsquo;s safety profile in two distinct kidney disease populations &ndash; those dependent on dialysis and pre-dialysis patients &ndash; although many remained unconvinced.</p>\n<p>Those doubters will now feel. FibroGen revealed that the disclosed data had been adjusted post hoc for various stratification factors. On a pre-specified basis, on which regulatory decisions will be made, roxadustat&rsquo;s safety edge narrows in both populations.</p>\n<p>Last month, in <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001x7F-Qzud23_EploB0BjfRiuxupAkFb7zgcAU5XeosPnnwlKJhqdu69HU6AKZtK73OZyguvkbZUi3oJzmmzx1_R2bYHZrSc19VSq1jWPFJY10zW2pQpHDr0WCz0x53bPE2vf3Vnu5BAtQHjFcZJGklucKdM0Uh8Ewr5y9Q76LUHaU_IXS7qpr3i9smj7Yh8rdBUVX1d1L4mz9yQCUFGdS_8CYsn7t20Id8orfgq5MSSi5f9xoT7vZhJTE7tUu6M__8ZHBCVc9jAZnwoBgxtTckQF0a-BM3IAz&amp;c=Y0-rInX5HO8RWy6P0voDDsif8BThCsc-4XyaDpDUVUZnyTLC7FeDoA==&amp;ch=YSe8X-sz_Uriq2PZf9SUrfSj4HHnd5kCLRWYdNLTnj_zz_E_u4hLvQ==\"><strong>ICER's assessment of roxadustat</strong></a>, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review voiced similar concerns around the treatment's cardiovascular safety data. ICER's chief medical officer Dr David Rind explained why the ICER&rsquo;s independent appraisal committee, CTAF, voted unanimously (15-0) that the evidence is not adequate to show that roxadustat provides a net health benefit over usual care:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The effect of roxadustat on cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality is of particular concern. The drug maker has conducted multiple trials examining this issue, but although these trials ended several years ago, the company has not yet made public a number of analyses that we feel are necessary to answer several key questions. This leaves large uncertainties about the balance of risks and benefits of roxadustat, and the votes of the CTAF panel confirmed these concerns. I think it's safe to assume these questions will be a focus of FDA&rsquo;s July 15 AdCom meeting,&rdquo; said Dr Rind.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trouble brewing for Provention?</strong></h2>\n<p>Provention Bio licensed the old Eli Lilly drug teplizumab a few years ago, hoping to bring the experimental drug back from the dead in type 1 diabetes after it flamed out in a pivotal diabetes study undertaken by the Big Pharma more than 10 years ago. But Provention is seeing <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/market-frets-over-deficiencies-in-teplizumab-submission\">troubled waters ahead following new feedback</a> from the FDA last week, according to Max Gelman writing on EndPoints News.</p>\n<p>The biotech revealed Thursday that regulators expressed concerns over the candidate&rsquo;s pharmacokinetics data and comparability to when Lilly first put teplizumab into clinical trials. Regulators are asserting the PK profiles from Provention&rsquo;s studies and Lilly&rsquo;s trials are not the same and asked for more data on April 2.</p>\n<p>In an ominous sign, regulators have said that such concerns mean it is not ready to start post-marketing and label discussions, per Provention&rsquo;s accounting of the feedback. Such comments are eerily similar to Acadia&rsquo;s dementia program, which received a CRL just last week.</p>", "date": "2021-04-11 10:48:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 9, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, COVID-19, Takeda, CSL Ltd, CoVig-19, AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Acadia Pharma, Nuplazid, FibroGen, Roxadustat, Provention Bio, Teplizumab", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 9, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-11 10:43:20", "updated": "2021-04-11 11:05:12", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-9-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Diabetes, Infectious diseases, Nephrology and Hepatology, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, CSL Ltd, FibroGen, Provention Bio, Takeda", "drug_tag": "Nuplazid, roxadustat, teplizumab, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-11 10:48:00"}
