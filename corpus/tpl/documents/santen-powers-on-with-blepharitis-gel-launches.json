It&rsquo;s therefore crucial that we recognize that this condition needs a careful diagnostic approach and personalized management, and that we continue to educate patients on the value of lid hygiene, such as using warm compresses and cleansing the eyelids daily.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;However, we know that some patients struggle with current hygiene options and that even mild forms of blepharitis will only be successfully managed if patients persevere.</p>\n<p>Luis Iglesias, president and head of Santen, added:&nbsp;&ldquo;Blepharitis can be sore, troublesome, uncomfortable and irritating for people so it can have a serious negative impact on quality of life. Our survey demonstrated that blepharitis interferes with daily activities and can prevent reading and normal use of a computer or phone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With blepharitis impacting how people can use screens plus digital device usage increasing since the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to reaffirm our commitment to eye care with the launch of Puralid Lipogel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 17:12:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "blepharitis, Santen, Puralid, Lipogel, Europe, launch, launches, patients, powers, ticked, specialist, Japanese, ophthalmic, opthalmology, people, date", "meta_description": "Japanese opthalmology specialist Santen has now ticked off much of Europe with its launch of Puralid Lipogel, an ophthalmic gel for blepharitis.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 17:00:12", "updated": "2021-05-08 14:05:02", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/santen-powers-on-with-blepharitis-gel-launches", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "santen-big.png", "image2id": "santen-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Blepharitis", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Ophthalmics", "topic_tag": "Product Launch", "geography_tag": "Europe, Japan", "company_tag": "Santen", "drug_tag": "Puralid Lipogel", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 17:12:00"}
