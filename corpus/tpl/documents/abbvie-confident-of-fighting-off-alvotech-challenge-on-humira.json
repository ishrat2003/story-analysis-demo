Specifically, the Patent Office has rejected as baseless four separate validity attacks on one of the asserted patents.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-14 15:15:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Humira, AbbVie, Alvotech, patents, drug, pharma, latest, challenge, confident, fighting, billion, sell, competition, diseases, inflammatory, adalimumab", "meta_description": "US pharma major AbbVie has answered back in its latest row over Humira (adalimumab), the inflammatory diseases drug that it continues to sell without competitio", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-14 15:11:33", "updated": "2021-05-14 16:08:16", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abbvie-confident-of-fighting-off-alvotech-challenge-on-humira", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "abbvie_scientist_large.jpg", "image2id": "abbvie_scientist_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Inflammatory diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Legal, Patents & Trademarks", "geography_tag": "Iceland, USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Alvotech", "drug_tag": "AVT02", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-14 15:15:00"}
