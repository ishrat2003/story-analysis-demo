{"contentid": 488149, "importid": NaN, "name": "Manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan for Joyclu", "introduction": "Japanese firms Ono Pharmaceutical and Seikagaku Corp have announced that Seikagaku has obtained manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for Joyclu (diclofenac etalhyaluronate sodium; ONO-5704/SI-613) 30mg Intra-articular Injection for the indication of osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint).", "content": "<p>Japanese firms Ono Pharmaceutical (TYO: 4528) and Seikagaku Corp (TYO: 4548) have announced that Seikagaku has obtained manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for Joyclu (diclofenac etalhyaluronate sodium; ONO-5704/SI-613) 30mg Intra-articular Injection for the indication of osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint).</p>\n<p>The approval is based on the results of three Phase III clinical studies conducted with ONO-5704/SI-613 in Japan. In the confirmatory study in patients with knee osteoarthritis, ONO-5704/SI-613 group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in WOMAC pain scores (a knee pain evaluation index, 100 mm VAS scale) over 12 weeks after the initial injection (three injections every four weeks), the primary endpoint of the study, compared to an inactive placebo group. Further, the safety profile of ONO-5704/SI-613 has shown no clinically-significant concerns in the study.</p>\n<p>Joyclu is a formulation in which hyaluronic acid and diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory drug) are chemically bound using Seikagaku&rsquo;s own proprietary technology. It is designed to release diclofenac by hydrolysis in the joint. Further, since Joyclu is administered directly into the joint cavity as an injectable treatment, systemic exposure to diclofenac is low, and the risk of systemic adverse drug reaction is thought to be low. Joyclu is the first joint function improvement agent in Japan indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip joint.</p>\n<p>IN 2017, Ono and Seikagaku entered the co-development and marketing collaboration on the osteoarthritis candidate in Japan, which could be worth 12 billion yen ($110 million [then exchange rates]). The companies aim to contribute to improvement of quality of life (QOL) in patients by providing a new treatment option for osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint).</p>\n<p>Seikagaku will manufacture and market Joyclu, and Ono will be responsible for distribution. The companies say they will announce the launch date of Joyclu following the National Health Insurance drug price listing. There is no change in the forecast of consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 for either Ono or Seikagaku in connection with this matter.</p>\n<p>Image: knee_arthritis_stock_credit_depositphotos</p>", "date": "2021-03-25 11:34:00", "meta_title": "knee_arthritis_stock_credit_depositphotos", "meta_keywords": "Ono Pharma, Seikagaku, Joyclu, Diclofenac etalhyaluronate, ONO-5704, Osteoarthritis, Hip, Knee, Approval, MHLW", "meta_description": "knee_arthritis_stock_credit_depositphotos", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 11:33:03", "updated": "2021-03-25 11:46:09", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/manufacturing-and-marketing-approval-in-japan-for-joyclu", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "knee_arthritis_stock_credit_depositphotos.jpg", "image2id": "knee_arthritis_stock_credit_depositphotos_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Japan", "company_tag": "Ono Pharmaceutical, Seikagaku", "drug_tag": "diclofenac, Joyclu, ONO-5704/SI-613", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-25 11:34:00"}
