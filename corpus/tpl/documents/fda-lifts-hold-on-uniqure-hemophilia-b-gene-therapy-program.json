We look forward to announcing top-line 52-week data from the HOPE-B pivotal trial later this quarter,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical hold</strong></h2>\n<p>uniQure previously announced on December 21, 2020, that the FDA placed the hemophilia B program on clinical hold following the diagnosis of HCC in one patient in the HOPE-B trial. The patient had multiple risk factors associated with HCC, including a 25-year history of hepatitis C (HCV), history of hepatitis B (HBV). Chronic infections with hepatitis B and C have been associated with approximately 80% of HCC cases.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>All patients in uniQure&rsquo;s hemophilia B gene therapy program, including the 54 patients in HOPE-B, have had abdominal ultrasounds performed one year after dosing, and each will continue to be monitored by their care teams. Patients will continue to receive abdominal ultrasounds every six-months. No other cases of HCC have been reported in uniQure clinical trials conducted in more than 100 patients in hemophilia B and other indications, with some patients dosed more than 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>Etranacogene dezaparvovec has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA access to Priority Medicine (PRIME) regulatory initiative by the European Medicines Agency. In June 2020, the company and CSL Behring entered into a licensing agreement providing the CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL) subsidiary with exclusive global rights to etranacogene dezaparvovec. This licensing agreement has cleared antitrust regulatory review in Australia and the UK and is subject to ongoing review in the USA.</p>", "date": "2021-04-26 13:55:00", "meta_title": "FDA lifts hold on uniQure hemophilia B gene therapy program", "meta_keywords": "uniQure, Hemophilia B, Etranacogene dezaparvovec, AMT-061, Gene therapy program, Clinical hold, Lifted, FDA", "meta_description": "FDA lifts hold on uniQure hemophilia B gene therapy program", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-26 13:54:39", "updated": "2021-04-26 14:02:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-lifts-hold-on-uniqure-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-program", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "uniqure_hq_big.jpg", "image2id": "uniqure_hq_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Netherlands, USA", "company_tag": "uniQure", "drug_tag": "AMT-061, etranacogene dezaparvovec", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-26 13:55:00"}
