The results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting or publication.</p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly given the development, Merck&rsquo;s shares closed up 2.7% at 137.60 euros today.</p>\n<p>Bintrafusp alfa (M7824), discovered in-house at Merck, is in clinical development through a strategic <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/germany-s-merck-enters-mega-billion-dollar-cancer-deal-with-gsk\">alliance with GlaxoSmithKline</a> (LSE: GSK), under which the UK pharma major pledged as much as $4.23 billion to the German firm.</p>\n<p>In January, Merck also reported a Phase III setback in non-small cell lung cancer, leading the company to discontinue that program. Those results cast doubt on the future of the drug, and also meant that Merck is set to miss out on some hefty &ldquo;biobucks&rdquo; milestone payments due from GSK under the terms of the deal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the high unmet treatment need in BTC, where single agent immunotherapy in PD-L1 all comers has shown an ORR of 5.8%, we are encouraged by the single agent clinical activity of bintrafusp alfa in this study as a second-line treatment,&rdquo; said Dr Milind Javle, professor of GI medical oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and an investigator for the INTR@PID BTC 047 study. &ldquo;The bintrafusp alfa 047 study is one of the most important clinical investigations conducted for chemo-refractory biliary cancers, and I would like to thank the patients, families, and study team for their valuable participation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This study demonstrates single-agent activity with bintrafusp alfa in locally advanced or metastatic BTC, a disease that has been historically difficult to treat,&rdquo; said Dr Danny Bar-Zohar, global head of development for the Healthcare business sector of Merck, adding; &ldquo;The data will contribute to our understanding of addressing both TGF-&beta; and PD-L1 inhibition in the tumor microenvironment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A Phase II/III study of bintrafusp alfa in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for BTC (INTR@PID BTC 055), which is assessing a different hypothesis than the second-line monotherapy study, has completed enrollment in the Phase II portion and is currently ongoing, said Merck.</p>", "date": "2021-03-16 15:59:00", "meta_title": "Merck takes another hit on bintrafusp alfa development", "meta_keywords": "Merck KGaA, Bintrafusp alfa, Phase II, Cancer, Biliary tract, BTC, GlaxoSmithKline", "meta_description": "Merck takes another hit on bintrafusp alfa development", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-16 15:58:40", "updated": "2021-03-16 16:08:23", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-takes-another-hit-on-bintrafusp-alfa-development", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "merck_kgaa_new_large.jpg", "image2id": "merck_kgaa_new_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, UK", "company_tag": "GlaxoSmithKline, Merck KGaA", "drug_tag": "bintrafusp alpha", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-16 15:59:00"}
