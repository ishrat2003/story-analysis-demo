In this trial bexmarilimab is being investigated as a potential monotherapy in patients with solid tumors who have exhausted all treatment options.</p>\n<p>Analysts at Peel Hunt said this is &ldquo;intriguing&rdquo; data for bexmarilimab&rsquo;s potential across a range of hard-to-treat cancers while the committee&rsquo;s advice can potentially increase the number of patients that might benefit from the treatment.</p>\n<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>\n<p>As previously communicated, the first expansion stage (Part II) of the study has progressed significantly with strong patient recruitment across the 10 different hard-to-treat solid cancers under investigation. The latest data includes data from 67 Part II patients, and shows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A strong survival benefit following four bexmarilimabtreatment cycles among the 10 responding patients (partial response or stable disease as best response according to the RECIST 1.1 classification). The overall risk of death among these bexmarilimab<em>-</em>responding patients was reduced by 88% (with a hazard ratio for death of 0.119, CI 0.016-0.863) compared to non-responding patients.</li>\n<li>Within that 100-day treatment period, non-responding patients (57) continued to show progressive disease and 85% of these patients died (48).</li>\n<li>Within the same period, only 10% of bexmarilimab<em>-</em>responding patients died (1/10) and median overall survival was not reached among these responders.</li>\n<li>Responding patients showed a clear prolongation of progression free survival (PFS), with a 93% reduction in the risk of disease progression (with a hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.068, CI 0.016-0.290) compared to non-responding patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"This is very exciting data supporting bexmarilimab's unique mechanism of action and adding to the accumulating evidence of bexmarilimab&rsquo;s broad potential across a range of hard-to-treat cancers. The early observations of survival benefit and the stark contrast in progression of disease among patients who do not respond to bexmarilimab therapy show the clinical significance of Clever-1 as immunotherapy target and the potential patient benefit when its immune-suppressive control is removed. We look forward to gathering further data from these patient cohorts to support the design of our pivotal trials for bexmarilimab,\" said Faron&rsquo;s chief executive Dr Markku Jalkanen.</p>", "date": "2021-03-22 12:02:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Faron Pharmaceuticals, Clevegen, Bexmarilimab, Phase I/II, Tumors, Solid", "meta_description": "Faron Pharma leaps on new data for Clevegen", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": "Faron Pharma leaps on new data for Clevegen", "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-22 11:59:29", "updated": "2021-03-22 12:07:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/faron-pharma-leaps-on-new-data-for-clevegen", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "faron-big-1.png", "image2id": "faron-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Finland", "company_tag": "Faron Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "bexmarilimab, Clevegen", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-22 12:02:00"}
