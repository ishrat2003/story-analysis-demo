Pepaxto is a first in class PDC that targets aminopeptidases and rapidly releases alkylating agents into tumor cells. While there have been improvements in the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma in recent years, patients often build resistance to treatments over time, creating a demand for new and innovative treatment options. The number of patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma is growing and the number of cases diagnosed annually is expected to almost double in 20 years. There is currently no cure.</p>\n<p>Marty Duvall, chief executive at Oncopeptides commented: \"The accelerated US approval of Pepaxto is a key step forward in fulfilling Oncopeptides' core mission, to bring hope to patients in their battle against difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. Moving ahead, our focus is to further advance Pepaxto. We look forward to receiving top-line data from the Phase III OCEAN study in the second quarter. This comparative study is designed to support a future supplementary New Drug Application to expand the label.\"</p>\n<p>Pepaxto was approved under accelerated approval, which allows for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.</p>", "date": "2021-03-02 10:34:00", "meta_title": "Oncopeptides gets FDA accelerated approval for Pepaxto", "meta_keywords": "Oncopeptides, Pepaxto, Melphalan flufenamide, Melflufen, Multiiple myeloma, FDA, Approval", "meta_description": "Oncopeptides gets FDA accelerated approval for Pepaxto", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-02 10:32:43", "updated": "2021-03-02 10:42:53", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/oncopeptides-gets-fda-accelerated-approval-for-pepaxto", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "oncopeptides-og-image-b.jpg", "image2id": "fda_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Sweden, USA", "company_tag": "Oncopeptides", "drug_tag": "melflufen, melphalan flufenamide, Pepaxto", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-02 10:34:00"}
