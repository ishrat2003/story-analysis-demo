{"contentid": 488493, "importid": NaN, "name": "Pfizer expands anti-infectives pipeline with acquisition", "introduction": "US pharma giant Pfizer said yesterday that it has acquired San Diego-based Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held biotech dedicated to the development of therapies for debilitating and life-threatening diseases that affect people with compromised immune systems.", "content": "<p>US pharma giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) said yesterday that it has acquired San Diego-based Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held biotech dedicated to the development of therapies for debilitating and life-threatening diseases that affect people with compromised immune systems.</p>\n<p>Amplyx&rsquo; lead compound, fosmanogepix (APX001), is a novel investigational asset under development for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. Financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>In addition to fosmanogepix, Pfizer acquires Amplyx' early-stage pipeline, including potential antiviral (MAU868) and antifungal (APX2039) therapies. MAU868, licensed from Novartis (NOVN: VX), is a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody with activity against the BK virus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The acquisition of Amplyx follows an initial equity investment by Pfizer in December 2019 as part of Amplyx&rsquo; Series C financing. At that time, Pfizer joined a world class group of biotechnology investors that included 3&times;5 Partners, Adage Capital Management, Arix Bioscience, BioMed Ventures, Lundbeckfonden Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Pappas Capital, RiverVest Venture Partners and Sofinnova Investments.</p>\n<h2><strong>Adds to buy of Arixa</strong></h2>\n<p>Last October, Pfizer acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals, a company making a next-generation oral antibiotic, ARX-1796, that, if approved, would be one of the first new drugs of its kind in 35 years.</p>\n<p>More than 1.5 million cases of invasive fungal infections occur worldwide each year, with mortality rates as high as 30%-80% across infection types. Fosmanogepix has a novel mechanism of action with the potential to target fungal strains resistant to standard of care therapy. As there are only three classes of antifungal medications currently available, antifungal resistance can severely limit treatment options; a potential new therapeutic class may therefore be of importance for both physicians and patients. There has been no novel therapeutic class of antifungal therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in nearly 20 years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder of the devastating impact of infectious diseases, highlighting the continuous need for new anti-infective therapies to treat both emerging and difficult to treat bacterial, viral and fungal infections,&rdquo; said Angela Lukin, global president, Pfizer Hospital.</p>", "date": "2021-04-29 11:48:00", "meta_title": "Pfizer expands anti-infectives pipeline with acquisition", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Acquisition, M&A, Fosmanogepix, Anti-fungal", "meta_description": "Pfizer expands anti-infectives pipeline with acquisition", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-29 11:47:20", "updated": "2021-04-29 11:55:41", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pfizer-expands-anti-infectives-pipeline-with-acquisition", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "pfizer_colour_new_large.png", "image2id": "pfizer_colour_new_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics, Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "fosmanogepix", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-29 11:48:00"}
