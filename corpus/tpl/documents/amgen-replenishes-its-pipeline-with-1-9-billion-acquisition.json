This acquisition adds Five Prime's innovative pipeline to Amgen's leading oncology portfolio, the company said. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter and is subject to customary closing conditions.</p>\n<p>Unusually for an acquirer, Amgen&rsquo;s shares were up 1.5% at $227.38 by late-morning. However, its target, Five Prime, leapt 78% to $37.83.</p>\n<p>The deal represents a major win for shareholders of Five Prime, which, after a run of bad luck, was trading as low as $2.17 last March. As recently as last November, the biotech announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 7,200,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $21.00 per share.</p>\n<h2><strong>Deal will strengthen Amgen&rsquo;s oncology portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p>\"The acquisition of Five Prime offers a compelling opportunity for Amgen to strengthen our oncology portfolio with a promising late-stage, first-in-class global asset to treat gastric cancer,\" said Robert Bradway, chairman and chief executive at Amgen. \"We look forward to welcoming the Five Prime team to Amgen and working with them to leverage our best-in-class monoclonal antibody manufacturing capabilities to supply additional clinical materials, as well as expanded production quantities, to realize the full potential of bemarituzumab for even more patients around the world as quickly as possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is an exciting day for patients who may one day benefit from the promise of bemarituzumab and our full pipeline. I'm so proud of the Five Prime team and the science we've pioneered,\" said Tom Civik, president and CEO chief of Five Prime, adding: \"We see tremendous complementarity between the two companies. Amgen has global reach, world-class resources, and they share our deep passion for science and commitment to patients. I have full confidence that Amgen is the right company to work with us to bring our innovative cancer treatments to patients and to achieve our mission to rewrite cancer,\" he noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Five Prime&rsquo;s lead asset:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Five Prime's lead asset, bemarituzumab, is a first-in-class, Phase III ready anti-FGFR2b antibody with positive data from a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study in frontline advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Bemarituzumab targets FGFR2b, which has been found to be overexpressed in approximately 30% of patients with non-HER2 positive gastric cancer, as well as other solid tumors.</li>\n<li>The bemarituzumab Phase II FIGHT trial demonstrated clinically-meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) in the frontline treatment of patients with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The acquisition of Five Prime also supports Amgen's international expansion strategy. Gastric cancer is one of the world's most common forms of cancer and is particularly prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region, where Amgen expects to generate significant volume growth in the coming years. Amgen plans to leverage its presence in Japan and other Asia-Pacific markets to maximize bemarituzumab's potential.</p>\n<p>In addition, as part of this transaction, Amgen will receive a royalty percentage on future net sales in Greater China ranging from the high teens to the low twenties from a pre-existing co-development and commercialization agreement between Five Prime and Zai Lab (Shanghai).</p>\n<p>Five Prime's additional innovative pipeline programs complement Amgen's efforts to bring meaningful therapies to oncology patients.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-04 17:40:00", "meta_title": "Amgen replenishes its pipeline with $1.9 billion acquisition", "meta_keywords": "Amgen, Five Prime Therapeutics, Acquisition, M&A, Portfolio, Oncology, Bemarituzumab, Cancer, Gastric", "meta_description": "Amgen replenishes its pipeline with $1.9 billion acquisition", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-04 17:39:12", "updated": "2021-03-16 17:14:43", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-replenishes-its-pipeline-with-1-9-billion-acquisition", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "amgen-logo-big.jpg", "image2id": "amgen-logo-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, One to Watch Companies", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Amgen, Five Prime Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "bemarituzumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-04 17:40:00"}
