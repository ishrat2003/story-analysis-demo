A major component of the patient perspective is a drug&rsquo;s effect on Quality of Life (QoL) &ndash; a concept that has always been a heterogeneous entity that lacks clear definition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The FDA suggests that QoL is &lsquo;an abstract, multidimensional concept, which defines a patient&rsquo;s satisfaction with life in specific domains that they consider significant.&rsquo; QoL is best assessed through patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which are direct reports from the patient on their health and functional status. Most clinical trials today collect PROs as a routine part of their outcome assessment; however, there is no clear guidance on the analysis and interpretation of PROs data. This leaves the pharmaceutical industry with a major question: How much emphasis does the FDA place on QoL outcomes?</p>\n<h2><strong>Quality of life may be overshadowed by more meaningful outcomes</strong></h2>\n<p>Historical data on drug approvals shows that the FDA places more emphasis on &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; clinical endpoints, such as survival rate. In a systematic review, researchers assessed 210 oncology drugs that were recently approved by the FDA for new indications. At the time of regulatory approval, only about 14% of these applications had published evidence related to QoL; only 3% of these drugs had demonstrated clinically-meaningful improvements in QoL.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, its 2018 guidance document on clinical trial endpoints for cancer drugs and biologics, the emphasis is largely on survival. Patient-centered assessment is described as &lsquo;improvement&rsquo; or &lsquo;progression&rsquo; of symptoms.<sup>2</sup> The emphasis on patient perspective &ndash; and by extension QoL &ndash; is not clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>New guidance in the pipeline to clear confusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2016, after the US Senate passed the historic 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act, the FDA modified its drug approval process. While the primary purpose was to expedite the approval of new drugs and medical devices, this modification also emphasized the importance of incorporating the patient&rsquo;s voice during the drug development process. Recognizing the gap in guidance with respect to the patient perspective, the FDA has announced that it is publishing a series of regulatory documents that will guide the industry on engaging in patient-focused drug development.<sup>3,4</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Collecting &lsquo;patient experience data&rsquo; will be key to regulatory decision making&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>The new guidance documents place great emphasis on collecting and interpreting patient experience data. As the name suggests, patient experience data collects information on the patient&rsquo;s experience with the disease. Patient experience data consists of two arms:<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>Data related to the physical and psychosocial impact of the disease:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Signs and symptoms of the disease, and patient views on how these affect daily functioning;</li>\n<li>The course of disease over time &ndash; the patient&rsquo;s views on how the disease has impacted their QoL over the years;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The patient&rsquo;s experience with various treatment strategies in the past &ndash; accessibility and convenience of treatments, perceived clinical improvements, and side-effects encountered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data related to the patient&rsquo;s views and preferences for different treatment strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What needs still remain unmet despite treatments that are currently available;</li>\n<li>The patient&rsquo;s expectations of benefits from future treatments as opposed to current ones;</li>\n<li>The patient&rsquo;s tolerance to various side-effects;</li>\n<li>The patient&rsquo;s viewpoint on the trade-off between risks and benefits: what kind and magnitude of side-effects would be acceptable to them in view of the perceived benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Guidance documents on the utilization of patient experience data in the regulatory process</strong></h2>\n<p>Over the next year, the FDA aims to publish four documents on patient experience data that will offer guidance to the pharmaceutical industry during the drug development process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Collection of data:</strong> This document offers information on identifying the target population, sampling strategies, and methods for collection and management of data. This guidance was officially released in June 2020.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Identifying important parameters: </strong>This document provides guidance on how to identify disease parameters that would be considered significant from the patient&rsquo;s perspective. The burden of disease and the burden of treatment is considered as a part of this guidance, which is due for release this year.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Developing fit-for-purpose clinical outcome assessments: </strong>Once patient-centered parameters are obtained, they must be refined and used to formulate clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools that can be used for the investigational product being studied.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Converting COA tools into meaningful study endpoints:</strong> COA tools that have been developed from the patient perspective must be validated to measure defined study endpoints. This guidance document will explore methods and technologies to analyze COA data. The third and fourth parts of the guidance are still under development, and industry stakeholders have been invited to submit draft guidance.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>What all this means for the pharmaceutical industry</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the ongoing emphasis on patient-centricity, the pharmaceutical industry has still not adopted the concept as a significant part of the drug development process. A recent systematic review, which assessed phase I trials that had been conducted over a period of four years, pointed out that only 1.1% of studies used QoL measures as endpoints; even in these studies, the measures used were heterogeneous.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the FDA&rsquo;s current stance, the pharmaceutical industry must incorporate patient experience data early in the drug development process. It may be worthwhile to engage with subject matter experts, such as patients, caregivers, and advocacy groups, to collect patient data and develop COA tools even prior to phase I trials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The guidelines published by the FDA are non-binding recommendations; however, they do provide insight into the agency&rsquo;s current thinking on the topic. Going forward, COA tools that emphasize the patient perspective will be taken into consideration during the regulatory approval process. While industry stakeholders are welcoming the FDA&rsquo;s current stance of patient-focused drug development, experts believe further clarification is needed from the FDA on the regulatory decision-making process.<sup>6</sup> The release of the new guidance on formulating and analyzing COA tools may help the pharmaceutical industry in their efforts to keep the patient perspective at the center during the drug lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>REFERENCES:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arciero V, Delos Santos S, Koshy L et al.
