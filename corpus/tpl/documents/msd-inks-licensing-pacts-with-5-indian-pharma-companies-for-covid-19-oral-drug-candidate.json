MSD is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.<br /> <br /> Meantime, Hyderabad-headquartered Natco Pharma (BSE: 524816) has applied to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization in India for the approval of Phase III clinical trial of molnupiravir capsules and is also seeking an emergency approval of the drug based on \"compassionate use\" for patients.<br /> <br /> In a note to the stock exchanges, the company said that \"pre-clinical data have shown that molnupiravir has broad anti-influenza activity, including highly potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Patients treated with molnupiravir achieved response within five days of therapy indicating that the duration of treatment with molnupiravir is short, with the additional advantage of being an oral therapy.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Medicines Patent Pool discussions</strong></h2>\n<p>MSD has entered into these agreements to accelerate the availability of molnupiravir in India and in other low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies.
