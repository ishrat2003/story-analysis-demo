The applications are supported by positive results from a global Phase III open-label study over 24 weeks that evaluated the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor plus ivacaftor in 66 children ages six through 11 years old who have either two copies of the <em>F508del</em> mutation or one copy of the <em>F508del </em>mutation and one minimal function mutation.</p>\n<p>The applications will now be reviewed by the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the UK MHRA, each of which will issue an opinion regarding the potential approval for these patients.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are committed to working diligently with global regulators to expand the indication for our medicine such that younger people living with CF will also be able to access the triple combination therapy,&rdquo; said Nia Tatsis, executive vice president, chief regulatory and quality officer, adding: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s news is an important milestone in broadening our access worldwide and we are pleased that we were able to file with the EMA and the MHRA in parallel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In April 2021 the European Commission granted approval of the label extension for Kaftrio in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150mg for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients ages 12 years and older who have at least one <em>F508de </em>mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In May 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the same label for patients in Great Britain.</p>", "date": "2021-05-20 15:39:00", "meta_title": "EMA and MHRA validate regulatory applications for new use of Kaftrio", "meta_keywords": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Kaftrio, Indication, Children, EMA, MHRA, Cystic fibrosis", "meta_description": "EMA and MHRA validate regulatory applications for new use of Kaftrio", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-20 15:38:06", "updated": "2021-05-20 15:47:29", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-and-mhra-validate-regulatory-applications-for-new-use-of-kaftrio", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vertex_large.jpg", "image2id": "vertex_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, UK, USA", "company_tag": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Trikafta/Kaftrio", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-20 15:39:00"}
