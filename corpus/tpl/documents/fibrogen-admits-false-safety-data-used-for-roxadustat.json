We continue to have confidence in roxadustat&rsquo;s benefit risk profile.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Continues to prepare for AdCom</strong></h2>\n<p>FibroGen says it continues to prepare for the FDA Advisory Committee meeting and will work closely with the FDA to bring this important new treatment to patients living with anemia of CKD. Ahead of the FDA announcing that an AdCom would be convened on the roxadustat application, the agency had set a March 20 PDUFA date.</p>\n<p>There is no change in the underlying roxadustat data, or to the efficacy analyses from the Phase III program. The company has begun a comprehensive internal review to ensure such issues do not occur in the future.</p>\n<p>As previously announced, roxadustat has been launched in China and Japan for the treatment of anemia of CKD in both NDD and DD adult patients. These approvals were based on different studies conducted in the relevant geographies. In Europe, the Marketing Authorization Application for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia of CKD in patients both on dialysis and not on dialysis was filed by FibroGen&rsquo;s partner Astellas and accepted by the European Medicines Agency for review in May 2020.</p>", "date": "2021-04-07 14:12:00", "meta_title": "FibroGen admits false safety data used for roxadustat", "meta_keywords": "FibroGen, Roxadustat, Disclosure, Safety data, CKD, Anemia, Kidney disease", "meta_description": "FibroGen admits false safety data used for roxadustat", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-07 14:11:45", "updated": "2021-04-07 17:33:43", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fibrogen-admits-false-safety-data-used-for-roxadustat", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fibrogen_large.png", "image2id": "fibrogen_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "FibroGen", "drug_tag": "roxadustat", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-07 14:12:00"}
