Millions of Americans suffering from cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and other terrible diseases cannot afford to wait for vital treatments and cures while clinical trials are disrupted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We must use every federal avenue to restart US biomedical research and ensure that the clinical trials necessary to take basic research to the bedside receive the funding they urgently need.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Representative Fitzpatrick added: &ldquo;More funding is needed for critical research, treatment, and cures for deadly diseases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We must do whatever we can to fight for patients, survivors, and those adversely affected by halted clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide a unique funding mechanism going forward to restart stalled biomedical research in the USA.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>'Reduce perennial shortage of funds for critical research'</h2>\n<p>The LOANS for Biomedical Research Act proposes funding gaps caused by the pandemic without additional deficit spending and at minimal cost to taxpayers by creating a new class of investments called BioBonds. These are financial instruments comprised of loans to eligible biomedical companies and universities which have received Food and Drug Administration authorization for clinical trials advancing new treatments and cures.</p>\n<p>Since borrowers are required to be able to repay these extensions of credit regardless of project success, investors in BioBonds would be those with long-term, risk-adverse capital such as pension funds and insurers, rather than venture capitalists or pharmaceutical companies.</p>\n<p>It is hoped that the legislation would help restart stalled biomedical research in the USA and reduce the perennial shortage of funds for critical research into diseases affecting millions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 12:14:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "research, trials, cures, treatments, legislation, biomedical, funding, clinical, critical, delays, diseases, COVID-, pandemic, proposed, cancer, caused", "meta_description": "New bipartisan legislation has been proposed by two US Representatives that would fund critical research on treatments and cures for diseases including Alzheime", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 12:02:57", "updated": "2021-05-25 13:43:29", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-legislation-proposes-funding-trials-amid-covid-19-delays", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "capitol_large.jpg", "image2id": "capitol_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Biden administration, Drug Trial, Focus On, Government Affairs, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 12:14:00"}
