Some 62% of the groups believed that the pharma industry as a whole was very effective or effective at tackling the pandemic for the patients known to them.</p>\n<p>Half of 2020&rsquo;s respondent patient groups stated that the pharmaceutical industry as a whole had an excellent or good corporate reputation, the highest in 10 years that PatientView has been conducting its corporate-reputation surveys.</p>\n<p>The top-three pharma companies voted best for their response to COVID-19 in were, in first place the GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) subsidiary ViiV Healthcare, followed by the US pharma giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and then the Swiss pharma giant Roche (ROG: SIX).</p>\n<p>Top of the list of companies voted best for their overall corporate reputation was again ViiV Healthcare, as it was in 2019, with Roche also repeating its 2019 performance by coming in second. Pfizer, which of course was the first firm to gain regulatory approval in the western world for a COVID-19 vaccine, improved its positioning by three places by coming third.</p>\n<p>New entrant Horizon Therapeutics (Nasdaq: HZNP) came fourth and Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD), which was involved in developing COVID-19 therapeutics with mixed success, was fifth, followed by Novartis (NOVN: VX) and Janssen.</p>\n<p>The eighth-placed company, AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), climbed five places from the previous year, probably as a result of its involvement in developing a COVID-19 vaccine.
