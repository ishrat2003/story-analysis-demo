{"contentid": 488747, "importid": NaN, "name": "Call for advanced therapies to be exempt from EU GMO legislation", "introduction": "The European Commission (EC) should exempt advanced therapies from Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) legislation, which hurts Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to attract clinical trials and delays patient access to transformative medicines.", "content": "<p>The European Commission (EC) should exempt advanced therapies from Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) legislation, which hurts Europe&rsquo;s ability to attract clinical trials and delays patient access to transformative medicines.</p>\n<p>So says the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), and the European Association of Bioindustries (EuropaBio) in a paper published online in the journal Human Gene Therapy.</p>\n<h2>'Unintended consequence' of initial GMO legislation</h2>\n<p>The EC recognized that GMO requirements hinder the conduct of clinical trials in its April 29 study on new genomic techniques and in the 2020 Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, when it called for GMO legislation to be fit for purpose for addressing medicines.</p>\n<p>Initially, GMO legislation was primarily enacted to protect food consumers and the environment, but Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) such as gene therapies are affected as an unintended consequence.</p>\n<p>The uneven application of GMO requirements across European Union (EU) member states causes significant clinical trial delays despite findings that gene therapies pose a negligible risk to the environment.</p>\n<p>Galvanized by the pandemic, the EC granted a temporary derogation from GMO requirements to investigational COVID-19 medicinal products to accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments.</p>\n<p>An industry survey suggested that the temporary derogation decreased the amount of time required to complete clinical trials in Europe.</p>\n<p>According to the paper, a similar, but permanent, exemption is justified for gene therapies&mdash;which often treat life-threatening diseases that have few, or no, treatment options&mdash;while still preserving high quality and safety standards.</p>\n<h2>'Our hopes are set on the EC to improve patient access to revolutionary treatments'</h2>\n<p>Paige Bischoff, ARM&rsquo;s senior vice president of global public affairs, said: &ldquo;The EC recognized that time was of the essence when lifting GMO requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Time is also very much of the essence for people with cancer, inherited disorders and other life-threatening conditions. We call on the EC to take the same measures for advanced therapies and remove the unnecessary and unintended burden of GMO legislation so patients have timely access to transformative, potentially curative medicines.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The organizations call on the EC to put forward a proposal by 2022, the timeframe proposed by the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe. Without an exemption for gene therapies, the GMO requirements threaten the region&rsquo;s competitiveness with other parts of the world where GMO legislation is less complex and cumbersome.</p>\n<p>P&auml;r Tellner, director of regulatory affairs at EFPIA, said: &ldquo;In 2020, we welcomed the derogation from GMO legislation for COVID-19 treatments or vaccines in clinical trials.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Member companies are increasingly reporting how the derogation has removed the significant and time-consuming hurdles associated with GMO submissions, in addition to the clinical trial application. Swift action to a permanent exemption from GMO legislation allows the EU to prosper and most importantly for patients to continue to receive transformative, potentially life-saving therapies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Violeta Georgieva, EuropaBio&rsquo;s legal affairs manager, said: &ldquo;Freeing the conduct of clinical trials with investigational gene therapies from the heavy EU GMO administrative burden is critical for cutting-edge biotechnology companies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The use of CRISPR/Cas9, the latest promising tool in genome editing, can be overshadowed in the EU if developers and regulators are to follow the 2018 ruling of the EU Court of Justice, which puts the controversial GMO label on the Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR technology. Our hopes are set on the EC to improve patient access to revolutionary treatments by exempting them from the disproportionate and outdated GMO framework.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Shutterstock</a></p>", "date": "2021-05-26 13:11:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "legislation, therapies, clinical, advanced, European, trials, gene, exempt, access, requirements, medicines, patient, transformative, treatments, delays", "meta_description": "The European Commission (EC) should exempt advanced therapies from Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) legislation, which hurts Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to attract clin", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-26 13:01:03", "updated": "2021-05-26 13:39:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/call-for-advanced-therapies-to-be-exempt-from-eu-gmo-legislation", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "gene_therapy_credit_shutterstock_large.jpg", "image2id": "gene_therapy_credit_shutterstock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Genetics, Regenerative Medicine", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Government Affairs, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": "Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, EFPIA, EuropaBio Healthcare Biotech", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-26 13:11:00"}
