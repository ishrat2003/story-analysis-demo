Currently, in the European Union, there is no authorized standard treatment regimen with proven benefit in overall survival (OS) for patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC.</p>\n<h2><strong>Blockbuster potential</strong></h2>\n<p>Gilead gained rights to Trodelvy through its $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics in September last year, as part of its bid to expand in oncology. At that time, Cowan analyst Phil Nadeau said Trodelvy is expected to have $4 billion in peak sales.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive and life-threatening cancer. Unfortunately, for many people with this cancer, there are not enough effective treatment options and their prognosis is extremely poor,&rdquo; said Dr Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer,&nbsp;Gilead Sciences. &ldquo;The validation of our EU marketing application is an important step toward addressing the significant unmet medical need for people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>Immunomedics won accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for Trodelvy in April 2020, to treat adult patients with metastatic TNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.</p>\n<p>In addition to the European Union, regulatory reviews of SG in metastatic TNBC are currently underway in the UK, Canada, Switzerland and Australia, as well as in Singapore through Gilead&rsquo;s partner Everest Medicines.
