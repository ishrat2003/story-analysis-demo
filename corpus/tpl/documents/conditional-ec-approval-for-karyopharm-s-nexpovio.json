This marks the first product authorization in Europe for Karyopharm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conditional marketing authorization is supported by data from the positive Phase IIb STORM study, which evaluated selinexor in adult patients with heavily pre-treated, triple class refractory multiple myeloma and was published in the <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3111927-1&amp;h=2144283474&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1903455&amp;a=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine\">New England Journal of Medicine</a> in August 2019. Under the provisions of conditional approval by the EC, continued authorization for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial and is subject to additional monitoring. An EC marketing authorization through the centralized procedure (CP) is valid in all 27 European Union (EU) member countries, as well as the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Previously approved in USA as Xpovio</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the trade name Xpovio, the drug was approved in the USA in July 2019 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), and late last year for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Analysts suggest the drug could achieve over $700 million peak US sales in this indication.</p>\n<p>\"Nexpovio represents the first and only nuclear export inhibitor authorized in Europe and we are delighted to bring this new treatment option to eligible adult patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Despite advancements in the treatment of multiple myeloma, most adult patients will eventually relapse and develop disease that is refractory to all authorized therapies, further highlighting the urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanism of actions like Nexpovio,&rdquo; said Sharon Shacham, founder, president and chief scientific officer of Karyopharm.</p>\n<p>In February this year, services provider Clinigen Group (AIM: CLIN) &lsquo;partnered with Karyopharm to provide selinexor on an unlicensed basis as part of a Named Patient Program, to patients outside the US with multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</p>\n<p>\"Today's authorization is an important step forward in the international expansion of selinexor, now with marketing authorization for use in Europe, Israel and the US,\" said Dr Michael Kauffman, chief executive of Karyopharm. \"We are committed to making Nexpovio available in Europe initially through a Named Patient Program and are on track to submit a second European regulatory filing in April based on the positive data from the Phase III BOSTON study to potentially further expand Nexpovio to eligible adult patients in need of new treatment options,\" he added.</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 11:19:00", "meta_title": "Conditional EC approval for Karyopharm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nexpovio", "meta_keywords": "Karyopharm, Nexpovio, Selinexor, Approval, Conditional, European Commission, Myeloma, Multiple, Xpovio", "meta_description": "Conditional EC approval for Karyopharm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nexpovio", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 11:18:15", "updated": "2021-03-31 11:26:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/conditional-ec-approval-for-karyopharm-s-nexpovio", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "karyopharm_large.png", "image2id": "karyopharm_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, USA", "company_tag": "Karyopharm Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "Nexpovio, selinexor, Xpovio", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 11:19:00"}
