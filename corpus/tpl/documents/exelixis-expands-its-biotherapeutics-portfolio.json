Once the transfer is completed, Exelixis will control 100% of GamaMabs&rsquo; AMHR2 franchise technology including all assets pertaining to GamaMabs&rsquo; monoclonal antibody drug product murlentamab (GM-102).<br /> <br /> &ldquo;GamaMabs has generated a compelling body of pre-clinical data supporting the potential of AMHR2 as a target for novel oncology therapies and demonstrated the safety of an anti-AMHR2 monoclonal antibody in human clinical trials,&rdquo; said Peter Lamb, executive vice president, scientific strategy and chief scientific officer of Exelixis.</p>\n<p>He continud: &ldquo;Based on these data, we believe that applying our ADC capabilities to GamaMabs&rsquo; panel of antibodies against AMHR2 could yield a promising new addition to our biotherapeutics portfolio. Acquiring GamaMabs&rsquo; extensive know-how related to this target, as well as existing drug product and related manufacturing cell lines, will allow us to reduce significantly the development timeline compared with starting an AMHR2 program&nbsp;<em>de novo</em>. This is consistent with our strategy of advancing novel cancer therapies as rapidly as possible in order to enable new treatment options that may provide improved patient benefit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>St&eacute;phane Degove, chief executive at GamaMabs, added: &ldquo;We believe that placing our AMHR2 franchise with Exelixis will enable rapid and effective development of AMHR2-targeting cancer therapies while providing us with near-term revenue that can support development of our other pipeline programs and technologies.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-05 10:17:00", "meta_title": "Exelixis expands its biotherapeutics portfolio", "meta_keywords": "Exelixis, GamaMabs Pharma, Agreement, AMHR2-antibody, Murlentamab", "meta_description": "Exelixis expands its biotherapeutics portfolio", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-05 09:59:46", "updated": "2021-05-05 10:17:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/exelixis-expands-its-biotherapeutics-portfolio", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "exelixis-big-1.png", "image2id": "exelixis-little.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "France, USA", "company_tag": "Exelixis, GamaMabs Pharma", "drug_tag": "murlentamab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-05 10:17:00"}
