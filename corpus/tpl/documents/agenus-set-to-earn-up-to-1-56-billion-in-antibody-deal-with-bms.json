In preclinical studies this approach has shown significant potential in tumor models where anti-PD-1 or anti-TIGIT monospecific antibodies alone are ineffective.</p>\n<h2><strong>Deal provides $200 million upfront</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the agreement, BMS will become solely responsible for the development and any subsequent commercialization of AGEN1777 and its related products worldwide. Agenus will receive a $200 million upfront payment and up to $1.36 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net product sales.</p>\n<p>Agenus will retain options to conduct clinical studies under the development plan, to conduct combination studies with certain other Agenus pipeline assets, and also, on commercialization, to co-promote AGEN1777 in the USA. The agreement is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.</p>\n<h2><strong>Others in the field</strong></h2>\n<p>Bristol Myers, which alongside pharma giants Switzerland&rsquo;s Roche (ROG: SIX) and the USA&rsquo;s Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK), is one of the leading cancer immunotherapy developers, already was exploring TIGIT as a target.</p>\n<p>Roche is developing the anti-TIGIT therapy tiragolumab, for non-small cell lung cancer, while Merck is advancing its anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab into Phase III testing for NSCLC. A compound dubbed BMS-986207 is listed on a federal trials database as being in several studies, two of which are recruiting patients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) has a partnership to co-develop next-generation cancer immunotherapies from Arcus Biosciences' pipeline, which includes the anti-TIGIT antibody AB154.</p>\n<p>Agenus expects to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the development of AGEN1777 with the US Food and Drug Administration in the second quarter of 2021. BMS intends to advance the research and development of AGEN1777 in immuno-oncology for high priority tumor indications including non-small cell lung cancer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AGEN1777&rsquo;s differentiated mechanism of action provides the potential for potent anti-tumor activity; catalyzing our clinical TIGIT strategy aimed at serving more patients with unmet needs in cancer,&rdquo; said Debbie Law, senior vice president, head of Tumor Microenvironment Thematic Research Center, at Bristol Myers Squibb.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to partner with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop and commercialize AGEN1777. Their stellar record of success in this area has been an important determinant for our decision to enter into this transaction,&rdquo; said Garo Armen, chairman and chief executive of Agenus. &ldquo;Through such transactions we are able to balance between advancing our portfolio with highly qualified collaborators, while retaining our other innovations for speedy development and commercialization by Agenus,&rdquo; he added.</p>", "date": "2021-05-19 17:00:00", "meta_title": "Agenus set to earn up to $1.56 billion in antibody deal with BMS", "meta_keywords": "Agenus, Bristol Myers Squibb, License, Agreement, AGEN1777, TIGIT blocker", "meta_description": "Agenus set to earn up to $1.56 billion in antibody deal with BMS", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-19 16:59:17", "updated": "2021-05-19 17:07:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/agenus-set-to-earn-up-to-1-56-billion-in-antibody-deal-with-bms", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "agenusbig.jpg", "image2id": "agenussmall-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Agenus, Bristol-Myers Squibb", "drug_tag": "AGEN1777", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-19 17:00:00"}
