This equates to a 99.5% reduction in <em>S. aureus</em> bacterial nasal carriage which is a very effective reduction by accepted clinical measures.</li>\n<li>XF-73 showed 2.1 log, (&gt;99%), greater reduction than placebo in the same patient population and this difference in reduction of nasal burden of <em> aureus </em>was statistically highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) in both the micro-ITT and per protocol populations. The effect was maintained during surgery, considered the period when the risk for infections is the highest.</li>\n<li>Initial analysis of secondary endpoints shows a higher reduction of burden of nasal <em> aureus </em>in the XF-73 arm compared to placebo arm in the 24 hours before surgery, and this was also observed when the data was analyzed by area under the curve (AUC) and percentage of patients reaching a specific log reduction.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>These positive results were achieved with just four doses of 0.2% (w/w) XF-73 nasal gel in the 24 hours before incision and the start of surgery.</li>\n<li>There were no treatment related adverse events.</li>\n<li>Full results will be published in due course in a peer reviewed journal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Destiny Pharma now plans to discuss possible Phase III clinical study designs with regulatory bodies including the US FDA. The company believes that there is a significant commercial opportunity for XF-73 in the hospital setting which could generate peak annual product sales of up to $1 billion in the US alone.</p>", "date": "2021-03-29 10:55:00", "meta_title": "Destiny soars on new data for XF-73 Nasal Gel", "meta_keywords": "Destiny Pharma,  XF-73, Nasal Gel, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Phase IIb", "meta_description": "Destiny soars on new data for XF-73 Nasal Gel", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-29 10:52:29", "updated": "2021-03-29 11:11:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/destiny-soars-on-new-data-for-xf-73-nasal-gel", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "destiny-big.png", "image2id": "destiny-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics, Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "Destiny Pharma", "drug_tag": "XF-73", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-29 10:55:00"}
