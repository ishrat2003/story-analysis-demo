Ferriprox is available as a 1000mg twice-a-day oral tablet.</p>\n<p>The family-owned Italian drugmaker bought the rights to Ferriprox in February last year from ApoPharma, the US subsidiary of Canadian company Apotex, with the terms of the deal undisclosed.</p>\n<p><strong>Previous approved indications</strong></p>\n<p>Ferriprox is also FDA approved for treatment of transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes, including beta-thalassemia, when current chelation therapy is inadequate. This FDA approval expands the use of Ferriprox for patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias as well as patients with thalassemia regardless of prior iron chelation exposure.</p>\n<p>\"People who are living with SCD face significant challenges with pain and organ damage that can greatly impact their quality of life, and most who need blood transfusions also need iron chelation therapy including those with known kidney issues who have limited treatment options,\" said Giacomo Chiesi, head of Chiesi Global Rare Diseases.</p>\n<p>\"We believe that delivering an iron chelation therapy that has no dosage adjustment required for patients with mild to severe renal impairment may address a significant unmet need in SCD. We have a long history of commitment to the rare disease community and this FDA approval is a testament to the investments we continue to make in scientific research and development with patients at the center of everything we do,&rdquo; he added.</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 10:14:00", "meta_title": "Chiesi gains new US appro for Ferriprox", "meta_keywords": "Chiesi Farmaceutica, Chiesi Global Rare Diseases, Ferriprox, FDA, Approval, Iron overload, Anemias", "meta_description": "Chiesi gains new US appro for Ferriprox", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-04 09:21:52", "updated": "2021-05-04 10:14:49", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chiesi-gains-new-us-appro-for-ferriprox", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "chiesi-big.png", "image2id": "chiesi-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Italy, USA", "company_tag": "Chiesi Farmaceutici", "drug_tag": "Ferriprox", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 10:14:00"}
