Trials are also underway in children.</p>\n<p>The firm said it would be in a position to better estimate supply ranges for 2022 as its clinical program progresses, providing more information on required dosing levels.</p>\n<p>Moderna also announced that new data indicated the potential for a three-month refrigerated shelf life for the vaccine in alternative formats, which would facilitate easier distribution to doctor&rsquo;s offices and other smaller settings if authorized.</p>\n<p>The firm is also working on a next generation vaccine (mRNA-1283) that it believes will extend refrigerated shelf life even further.</p>", "date": "2021-04-29 12:39:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "vaccine, Moderna, manufacturing, doses, coronavirus, billion, mRNA, USA-based, supplies, boost, firm, drug, substance, aims, production, global, investing", "meta_description": "Cambridge, USA-based mRNA specialist Moderna is investing in manufacturing facilities to boost global supplies of its coronavirus vaccine in 2022.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-29 12:31:28", "updated": "2021-04-29 12:42:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/moderna-aims-to-make-three-billion-doses-of-coronavirus-vaccine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "moderna_therapeutics_large.jpg", "image2id": "moderna_therapeutics_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Production, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Moderna Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "mRNA-1273", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-29 12:39:00"}
