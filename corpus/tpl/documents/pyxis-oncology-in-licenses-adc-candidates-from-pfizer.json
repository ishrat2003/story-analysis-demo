Pfizer will receive an upfront payment and equity in Pyxis and is eligible to receive development and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties on potential sales.</p>\n<h2><strong>Also gains license to Pfizer&rsquo;s ADC platform</strong></h2>\n<p>As part of this agreement, Pyxis also was granted a license to Pfizer&rsquo;s ADC platform, including various payload classes, linker technology and site-specific conjugation techniques for the future development of additional ADCs. Pfizer will also continue to support the development and advancement of this portfolio through an equity investment made by Pfizer Ventures.</p>\n<p>Ronald Herbst, chief scientific officer of Pyxis, said: &ldquo;The early generations of ADCs demonstrated significant potency, but considerable room remains for innovation to generate highly effective ADCs with an improved safety profile. PYX-201 and PYX-203 represent the next generation of ADCs that use innovative conjugation technologies. By combining highly specific antibodies targeting clinically validated tumor markers with established linkers and both novel and proven payloads, we are excited to translate the extensive validating preclinical studies conducted by Pfizer to an improved clinical profile for patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jeff Settleman, Pfizer&rsquo;s chief scientific officer of oncology research and development, added: &ldquo;The Pyxis team of industry veterans led by Dr Sullivan and Dr Herbst has the experience needed to maximize the clinical potential of these therapeutics. This agreement underscores our commitment to ensure these molecules reach patients as quickly as possible. We look forward to the team&rsquo;s advancement of these therapeutics based on the promise of ADC technology to significantly impact the treatment landscape.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>PYX-201 is a first-in-class non-internalizing ADC that targets a tumor-restricted antigen that is overexpressed in several solid tumor types to selectively kill tumor cells while enhancing a robust anti-cancer immune response. PYX-203 is an ADC that targets an antigen expressed in certain hematologic malignancies. PYX-203 utilizes a highly potent DNA-damaging agent designed to reduce the potential development of drug resistance and disease relapse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 14:28:00", "meta_title": "Pyxis Oncology in-licenses ADC candidates from Pfizer", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, Pyxis Oncology, License, Agreement, ADC candidates, PYX-201, PYX-203", "meta_description": "Pyxis Oncology in-licenses ADC candidates from Pfizer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 14:26:30", "updated": "2021-03-18 14:37:41", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pyxis-oncology-in-licenses-adc-candidates-from-pfizer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "pfizer_colour_new_large.png", "image2id": "pfizer_colour_new_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Lara Sullivan", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Pfizer, Pyxis Oncology", "drug_tag": "PYX-201, PYX-203", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 14:28:00"}
