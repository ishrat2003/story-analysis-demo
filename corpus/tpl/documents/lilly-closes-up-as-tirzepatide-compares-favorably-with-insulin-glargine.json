For the efficacy estimand, the highest dose of tirzepatide led to an A1C reduction of 2.58% reduced body weight by 11.7kg compared to results for those treated with insulin glargine at 52 weeks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\">\"These strong results reinforce our belief that tirzepatide has the potential to be an exciting treatment for people living with type 2 diabetes\"</span>The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class in this patient population. Gastrointestinal side effects were the most commonly reported adverse events, usually occurring during the escalation period and then decreasing over time.</p>\n<p>SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest trial of the program to date and is the fifth and final global registration study for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes to be completed. The study completion was driven by the accrual of major adverse CV events in order to meet the regulatory submission requirements for evaluating CV risk for type 2 diabetes therapies.</p>\n<p>The primary endpoint was measured at 52 weeks, and many participants continued treatment beyond this point, some up to two years.</p>\n<p>Tirzepatide is an investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates the actions of the GIP and GLP-1 incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>John Doupis, senior investigator for SURPASS-4, said: &ldquo;Tirzepatide delivered impressive results in this study, providing superior A1C reductions compared to insulin glargine &ndash; as well as the addition of significant weight loss &ndash; in people with type 2 diabetes who have increased CV risk.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition that requires personalized approaches to treatment, and results from SURPASS-4 demonstrate the potential of tirzepatide to be an important option to help reduce A1C and weight for people with type 2 diabetes on one or up to three oral medicines.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mike Mason, president, Lilly Diabetes, said: &ldquo;These strong results reinforce our belief that tirzepatide has the potential to be an exciting treatment for people living with type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We look forward to meeting our goal of bringing an important new therapy to people living with this condition, including sharing more detailed results at scientific congresses and submitting to regulatory authorities later this year.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 15:09:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "tirzepatide, diabetes, type, insulin, glargine, study, SURPASS-, results, risk, treatment, people, trial, primary, increased, weight, closes, favorably", "meta_description": "Eli Lilly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tirzepatide has achieved all primary and key secondary study outcomes against insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiova", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 14:29:40", "updated": "2021-05-21 15:10:10", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lilly-closes-up-as-tirzepatide-compares-favorably-with-insulin-glargine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eli_lilly_lab_large.jpg", "image2id": "eli_lilly_lab_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Insulin glargine", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, Diabetes", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly", "drug_tag": "tirzepatide", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 15:09:00"}
