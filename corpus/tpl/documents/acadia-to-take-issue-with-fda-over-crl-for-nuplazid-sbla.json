Statistical separation by dementia subgroups and certain minimum numbers of patients with specific subtypes were not among the prespecified requirements.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will request a Type A meeting</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Acadia stands behind the robustly positive results from the pivotal Phase III HARMONY study and the prospectively agreed trial design and criteria for establishing efficacy in DRP. Over the entire course of the review, the Division did not raise any concerns regarding the agreed upon study design, including the issues raised in the CRL,&rdquo; said Steve Davis, chief executive</p>\n<p>of Acadia. &ldquo;We will immediately request a Type A meeting to work with the FDA to address the CRL and determine an expeditious path forward for the approval of pimavanserin in DRP,&rdquo; he stressed.</p>\n<p>The Division also stated in the CRL that it considers the Phase II Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease psychosis study -019, a supportive study in the sNDA filing, to not be adequate and well controlled, citing that it was a single center study with no type I error control of secondary endpoints in which certain protocol deviations occurred. The Company believes these observations impact neither the positive results on the study&rsquo;s primary endpoint, nor the study&rsquo;s overall conclusions of efficacy.</p>", "date": "2021-04-06 10:56:00", "meta_title": "Acadia to take issue with FDA over CRL for Nuplazid sBLA", "meta_keywords": "Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Nuplazid, sBLA, FDA, Complete response letter, CRL, Psychosis, Dementia-related, DRP", "meta_description": "Acadia to take issue with FDA over CRL for Nuplazid sBLA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-06 10:55:38", "updated": "2021-04-06 11:02:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/acadia-to-take-issue-with-fda-over-crl-for-nuplazid-sbla", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "acadiabig.png", "image2id": "acadiasmall.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "ACADIA Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Nuplazid, pimavanserin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-06 10:56:00"}
