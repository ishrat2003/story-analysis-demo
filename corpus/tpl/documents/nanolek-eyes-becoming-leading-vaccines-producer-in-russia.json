So far, these plans have been recently confirmed by the president of Nanolek Vladimnir Khristenko. According to him, this will allow the company to triple the current portfolio of vaccines by 2025 and increase its share of public procurements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At present, the company does not have its own production of vaccines, producing the poliomyelitis vaccine together with the Dutch firm Bilthoven Biologicals. The company also cooperates with French drug major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) by conducting secondary packaging of its pentaxim vaccine, preparing for the launch of the production of a finished dosage form.</p>\n<p>The increase of vaccines production is an acute need for Nanolek, which also due to the existing state requirements for suppliers to establish their own production of vaccines until 2035.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analysts also believe the latest investment plans of Nanolek will be beneficial to its foreign partners and will ease access to public procurements in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Mr Khristenko, most of the allocated funds will be invested in the equipment of the firm&rsquo;s R&amp;D centers in Moscow, as well as the purchase of new equipment for the production of biotechnological active ingredients at its plant in the city of Kirov. Finally, part of the funds will be invested in the conduction of clinical trials of the HPV vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By 2022 Nanolek plans to launch the production of Sanofi&rsquo;s vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal infection, as well as to launch production of a vaccine against pneumococcal infection of the South Korean SK Bioscience.</p>\n<p>According to the Russian analyst agency Headway Company, in 2020 state tenders for the purchase of pneumococcal vaccine in Russia reached 12.9 billion roubles in value terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In general, Nanolek plans to produce up to four of its vaccines, among which are a vaccine for the prevention of shingles as well as COVID-19 (no earlier than 2024). The development of two other vaccines is ongoing, but the company has not disclosed information on them yet. In addition, this autumn it will begin clinical trials of a vaccine against human papillomavirus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nanolek was founded in 2011. Among the beneficiaries are Vladimir Khristenko, the son of the ex-Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Viktor Khristenko, as well as general director of the company Mikhail Nekrasov.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-05 10:16:00", "meta_title": "Nanolek eyes becoming leading vaccines producer in Russia", "meta_keywords": "Nanolek, Production, Vaccines, Russia, Poliomyelitis, Meningococcal, Pneumococcal, Shingles", "meta_description": "Nanolek eyes becoming leading vaccines producer in Russia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-05 09:06:17", "updated": "2021-05-05 10:16:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nanolek-eyes-becoming-leading-vaccines-producer-in-russia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "nanolek-large.jpg", "image2id": "nanolek-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, Production, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "Nanolek, Sanofi", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-05 10:16:00"}
