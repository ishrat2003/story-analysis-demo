The company&rsquo;s shares ere up 3.6% at 100.46 pence in early trading.</p>\n<p>The data has been presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW), on May 22, 2021, by Professor Eamonn Quigley, head of gastroenterology and hepatology at Houston Methodist Hospital, Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical, and chief investigator of the study.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4D pharma previously announced top-line efficacy and safety results from the trial, conducted in the USA, UK and Ireland, in October 2020. Further analysis of the data has revealed strong and statistically-significant activity on the key symptom of bowel habit, a potential approvable primary endpoint per regulatory guidelines. In addition, analysis of the data by geographical region shows that earlier top-line results were impacted by an unusually high placebo response in patients in the UK and Ireland, and enhanced positive signals were seen in the larger US population.</p>\n<p>Single strain LBP Blautix is the first therapeutic globally to have demonstrated efficacy in both IBS-C and IBS-D. The clinically meaningful overall response rates and improvements in bowel habit in both IBS-C and IBS-D in this signal finding Phase II trial, in spite of an unexpectedly high placebo response in certain patient groups, are highly encouraging for subsequent larger studies with increased statistical power.</p>\n<p>\"Following the announcement of the top-line results in October, 4D pharma has been able to review the data in more detail. We have also discussed the results with internationally renowned key opinion leaders and patient groups. We are encouraged by the positive outcomes of this additional analysis, and we strongly believe that this signal finding study supports the continued development of Blautix as a novel treatment for IBS,\" said Dr Alex Stevenson, chief scientific officer at 4D pharma.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Data support continued development of Blautix</strong></h2>\n<p>\"The Phase II results, in conjunction with regulatory guidance and KOL discussions, provide a clear and viable path forward for 4D pharma to continue to develop Blautix to address a significant unmet need. Top-line results were significantly impacted by an unusually high placebo response in certain geographical patient groups. Despite this, the activity of Blautix relative to placebo in this Phase II study is competitive with approved IBS therapeutics. We are pleased to now share our additional positive findings following more detailed analysis of the clinical data. With the vital learnings we have gained, we are now even more enthusiastic about the chances of success in subsequent, larger, well-powered studies,\" Dr Stevenson added.</p>\n<p>The signal finding Phase II study was a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It enrolled 353 patients in the USA, UK and Ireland with IBS-C or IBS-D as defined by the Rome IV criteria, and moderate or severe IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) of &ge;175 at screening (158 IBS-C and 195 IBS-D patients). Each sub-type cohort was randomized 1:1 to receive oral Blautix or placebo, two capsules twice daily, for eight weeks. The study was designed to generate signals of activity in both IBS-C and IBS-D and to define key parameters for a pivotal program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-24 10:20:00", "meta_title": "Positive data 4D pharma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blautix in irritable bowel syndrome", "meta_keywords": "4D pahrma, Blautix, Phase II, IBS-C, Irritable bowel syndrome", "meta_description": "Positive data 4D pharma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blautix in irritable bowel syndrome", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-24 09:16:31", "updated": "2021-05-24 10:20:34", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-data-4d-pharma-s-blautix-in-irritable-bowel-syndrome", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vials_research_lab_biotech_big.jpg", "image2id": "vials_research_lab_biotech_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Gastroenterology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "4D pharma", "drug_tag": "Blautix", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-24 10:20:00"}
