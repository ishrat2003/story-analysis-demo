{"contentid": 488710, "importid": NaN, "name": "Pharmacological treatments for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)", "introduction": "In support of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) Awareness Month, we explore the pharmacological landscape of this rare condition.", "content": "<p><strong>By Dr Nicola Davies</strong></p>\n<p>In support of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) Awareness Month, we explore the pharmacological landscape of this rare condition.</p>\n<p>What is EDS?</p>\n<p>There are 13 different subtypes of EDS, each originating from a specific genetic change and each with its own symptoms and criteria for diagnosis.<sup>1</sup> The estimated incidence of all EDS types ranges from 1/2,500 to 1/5,000. Classical EDS (cEDS), hypermobility EDS (hEDS) and vascular EDS (vEDS) are the most common subtypes, with cEDS affecting 1/20,000 to 1/40,000, hEDS affecting 1/10,000 to 1/15,000, and vEDS affecting 1/50,000 to 1/200,000.<sup>2,3</sup> Subtypes such as kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS), arthrochalasia EDS (aEDS) and dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS) are much rarer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Only 12 incidences of dEDS have been diagnosed, with 30 cases of aEDS and 60 for kEDS.<sup>2 </sup>The sheer variability of these subsets has contributed to the difficulties faced in finding a treatment for the disease. Instead, pharmacological interventions are often focused on the treatment of symptoms, which include muscle pain, loose joints, muscle fatigue, overly elastic skin, frequent bruising, and benign growths on pressure areas such as elbows and knees.<sup>4</sup> While there are currently no FDA approved pharmacological interventions for EDS, a few drugs are being developed.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Current treatment options</strong></h2>\n<p>The current treatment options for EDS are focused more on symptom management, which involves medication, surgery and physical therapy.<sup>5</sup> EDS is a connective tissue disease and symptoms such as pain are treated with over-the-counter pain medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium), while weak joints and constant dislocations are often managed through surgery and physical therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin/norepinephrine receptor inhibitors (SNRIs) are also frequently prescribed to EDS patients, while stronger medications are prescribed in cases of acute injury.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patients with vEDS are at risk of spontaneous arterial rupture, which can make surgery quite risky. For some patients, blood pressure medication is used to maintain low pressure on blood vessels to reduce risk of rupture.<sup>6</sup> Recombinant factor VIIa has been successfully used to treat intractable bleeding in the same EDS subtype, and in one study patients reported improvement in their condition after being given vitamin C at 4g/day.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prolotherapy</em></strong></p>\n<p>Prolotherapy is considered a form of regenerative medicine and is often used as a last resort when other therapies have failed.<sup>7</sup> The treatment involves injecting a solution containing sugar (dextrose), phenolic compounds, and growth factors directly into the connective tissue to stimulate tissue growth and strengthen tendons, ligaments and other connective tissue. It can also provide pain relief. There are three types of prolotherapy:<sup>7</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Growth factor injection prolotherapy:</strong> this involves the injection of a growth factor to promote the buildup of specific cells (such as fibroblasts) at the injection site.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth factor stimulation prolotherapy:</strong> this involves injecting low-concentration doses of dextrose into the tissue, inducing cells, to produce growth factors that help with the growth and migration of certain cell types. The cells then secrete collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins to strengthen connective tissues at the site of injection.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflammatory prolotherapy:</strong> this involves injecting higher concentrations of dextrose alongside phenolic compounds such as procaine, lidocaine or sodium morrhuate into the joints. This solution causes low inflammation at the injection site, which induces migration of immune cells to the site in an attempt to restore the joint.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following prolotherapy sessions, tissue growth is monitored using a MRI and high-resolution ultrasound.<sup>7</sup> While the individual components of a prolotherapy injection are FDA-approved, the actual procedure is not policed by the FDA and is often not covered by medical insurance. Prolotherapy advocates claim it has long-lasting benefits and can eliminate the need for surgery to fix weakened and painful joints, as well as eliminating the need for pain medication.<sup>8,9</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Innovations in pharmacological interventions</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><em>Edsivo</em></strong></p>\n<p>In December 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration granted priority review of Edsivo (celiprolol), a new drug developed by Acer Therapeutics for the treatment of vEDS in patients with a confirmed type III collagen mutation.<sup>10,11</sup> The drug is believed to treat vEDS by promoting normal synthesis of collagen in the blood vessels.<sup>12</sup> In 2015, Edsivo had received FDA Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of vEDS. Acer Therapeutics&rsquo; new drug application (NDA) was based on a Phase 4 clinical trial (NCT00190411), where 53 participants were randomized to receive either Edsivo or a placebo daily. Results showed that a significantly lower number of participants treated with Edsivo reported a ruptured artery (20% vs. 50% for placebo participants), indicating that the drug could greatly reduce the risk of serious cardiac events. The risk of intestinal or uterine ruptures were also significantly lower in participants given Edsivo (24% vs. 61%).<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, in a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA to Acer Therapeutics, the regulatory agency requested additional data from an &ldquo;adequate and well-controlled&rdquo; clinical trial that demonstrates that Edsivo can significantly reduce the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS before approval can be given.<sup>14,15</sup> The original clinical trial was deemed too small and poorly controlled.<sup>16</sup> A meeting with the FDA was held in the second quarter of 2021 and Acer Therapeutics outlined plans to collect additional data for resubmission.<sup>11</sup> However, it has been announced that the drug will be dropped if plans are rejected by the FDA or if the cost, risk and uncertainty of running additional trials does not justify the continued development of the drug.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>AR101</em></strong></p>\n<p>Aytu Biopharma, a specialty pharmaceutical company, has announced a clinical trial for a drug with the potential to reduce life-threatening events in vEDS.<sup>17</sup> The drug, AR101 (enzastaurin), developed by Denovo Biopharma and licensed to Aytu, is an investigational oral compound that inhibits the protein kinase C beta (PKC&beta;) pathway.<sup>18</sup> Mouse models have shown the involvement of the PKC&beta; pathway in the pathogenesis of vEDS, and the upcoming clinical trial is expected to illustrate the drug&rsquo;s ability to reduce severe complications of vEDS.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Excellagen</em></strong></p>\n<p>Excellagen is a type 1 collagen-based topical gel approved by the FDA for over 17 different types of wounds.<sup>20</sup> The gel&rsquo;s 3D matrix promotes platelet production, which leads to the release of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factors that stimulate the healing process. It also provides structural scaffolding for cellular proliferation and migration, which in turn boosts tissue growth.<sup>21</sup> Excellagen was originally developed by Olaregen Therapeutix. Generex pharmaceuticals, which is in the process of obtaining over 51% stake in Olaregen Therapeutix, has announced that it is now seeking orphan drug approval for the use of Excellagen for treating the wounds of EDS patients. While the efficacy of the gel in treating various types of wounds has been established in multiple clinical trials, the same is yet to be explored in relation to the wounds of EDS patients.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What next for Pharma?</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the challenges of drug development for EDS is enrolling enough participants to carry out thorough clinical trials. Big pharmaceutical companies must look past the commercial non-viability of orphan drugs and collaborate with &ndash; or support &ndash; smaller pharma or biotechnology companies working in this area. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, significant strides in research and drug development can be made when enough resources can be collated and when companies collaborate.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Ehlers-Danlos Society (2021).
