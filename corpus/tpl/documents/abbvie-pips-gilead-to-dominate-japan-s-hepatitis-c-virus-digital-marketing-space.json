While high cure rates are going to reduce the diagnosed prevalent cases and subsequently decrease the market size, AbbVie and Gilead are still trying to leave no stone unturned to sustain their presence and dominate the market by offering branded and unbranded digital support for patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s &lsquo;Digital Marketing Intelligence&rsquo; identified AbbVie&rsquo;s branded websites such as &lsquo;Maviret.jp&rsquo; and Gilead&rsquo;s &lsquo;Epclusa.jp&rsquo;, &lsquo;Harvoni.jp&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Sovaldi.jp&rsquo;, and unbranded websites such as &lsquo;Cgatakanen-support.net&rsquo;, BMS&rsquo; &lsquo;Kanen-net.info&rsquo;, Gilead&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hcvcanbecured.jp&rsquo; and &lsquo;Naosou-cgatakanen.jp&rsquo;, and Mitsubishi Tanabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kankinou.net&rsquo;.</p>\n<h2><strong>Digital traffic</strong></h2>\n<p>An analysis of the traffic over the last 18 months (June 2020 to February 2021 versus September 2019 to May 2020) revealed highest traffic to the unbranded websites of BMS&rsquo; &lsquo;Kanen-net.info&rsquo; and Mitsubishi Tanabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kankinou.net&rsquo; that support multiple liver diseases, followed by AbbVie&rsquo;s dedicated unbranded site for HCV, &lsquo;Cgatakanen-support.net&rsquo;. Among the branded websites, AbbVie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Maviret.jp&rsquo; received higher traffic than Gilead&rsquo;s branded websites.</p>\n<p>Mr Vale concludes: &ldquo;The HCV treatment landscape witnessed a major transformation with the launch of novel DAAs by Gilead and AbbVie in the recent years with their drugs showing high cure rates thus making the companies the current market leaders. AbbVie&rsquo;s digital initiatives to support Maviret have helped the company to position itself above Gilead, which has three marketed products including the recently approved Epclusa. Hence, an increased focus on strengthening digital presence is required from Gilead to compete with AbbVie.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;hepatitis_liver_infection_credit_deposit_photos</p>", "date": "2021-03-10 12:27:00", "meta_title": "AbbVie pips Gilead to dominate Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hepatitis C virus digital marke", "meta_keywords": "AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, Hepatitis C, Competition, Japan, Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa, Viekirax, Maviret, GlobalData", "meta_description": "AbbVie pips Gilead to dominate Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hepatitis C virus digital marketing space", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-10 12:26:22", "updated": "2021-03-10 12:40:48", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abbvie-pips-gilead-to-dominate-japan-s-hepatitis-c-virus-digital-marketing-space", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "hepatitis_liver_infection_credit_deposit_photos_large.jpg", "image2id": "hepatitis_liver_infection_credit_deposit_photos_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Hepatitis C", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-virals", "topic_tag": "Digital Pharma, Management, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, GlobalData", "drug_tag": "Epclusa, Harvoni, Maviret, Sovaldi, Viekirax", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-10 12:27:00"}
