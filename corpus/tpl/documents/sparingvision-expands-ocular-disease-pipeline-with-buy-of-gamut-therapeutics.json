Further financial terms of the transaction are not disclosed.</p>\n<p>GAMUT&rsquo;s lead product, now SPVN20, is a novel, mutation-agnostic gene therapy, which aims at restoring the function of dormant cone cells in the retina. Dormant cones are viable cones that have lost their function during the progression of a degenerative retinal disease.</p>\n<p>SparingVision also intends to evaluate the potential therapeutic synergy of the two products through the combination of SPVN06 and SPVN20 in a sequence of treatments and/or as a single construct to address a broader population of RP patients. Beyond RP, SparingVision will explore opportunities to evaluate SPVN20 in other retinal diseases, for which its mechanism of action could also be particularly relevant.</p>\n<h2><strong>May create new GIRK-based cell therapy company</strong></h2>\n<p>As part of the acquisition agreement, SparingVision has the right to participate in the creation of a new GIRK-based cell therapy company, that would be started by the founding shareholders of GAMUT with a first GIRK-based product.</p>\n<p>GAMUT is a spin-out of the Institut de la Vision in Paris, focused on pioneering the unique research of scientific founder Dr Deniz Dalkara and her collaborators. It was started in 2020 with seed funding from Advent France Biotechnology.</p>", "date": "2021-04-20 13:42:00", "meta_title": "SparingVision expands ocular disease pipeline with buy of GAMUT Therap", "meta_keywords": "SparingVision, GAMUT Therapeutics, Acquisition, M&A.
