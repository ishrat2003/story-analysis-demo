That disclosure could include having pharmaceutical companies providing training, technical assistance, materials and company documents.<br /> <br /> However, pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to hand over valuable trade secrets willingly, and it's unclear if they could be forced to under a compulsory license, experts say.<br /> <br /> Negotiations over the waiver will very likely hit a snag when it comes to trade secrets, according to Lisa Ferri, global co-chair of Mayer Brown&rsquo;s intellectual property practice.</p>\n<p>The waiver, proposed by South Africa and India and supported by more than 100 other World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, would specifically suspend four provisions of the 1995 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, agreement requiring WTO members to enact laws protecting IP.<br /> <br /> The revised version released Tuesday said the waiver should be in force for three years. While the original version said the waiver should apply to preventing, treating and containing COVID-19, the revised version specified it was targeted at \"health products and technologies.\"</p>\n<h2><strong>Foreign government powers</strong></h2>\n<p>One open question is whether foreign governments could have jurisdiction to force US companies to disclose trade secrets under a compulsory license, according to Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former WimerHale partner.<br /> <br /> That could be especially tricky if a US-based company doesn't have a presence in a country that wants to issue a compulsory license, since compulsory trade secret disclosure would require a company to take a certain action, such as sending employees to the country for training, Prof Contreras told Law360.</p>\n<p>In countries like China, where the vaccine-producing companies have a presence, such as Pfizer, compulsory licenses on trade secrets might be easier to enforce, he said. For example, those governments could impose fines on companies that refuse to comply and seize assets if they refuse to pay up.<br /> <br /> But enforcement will be murkier when the companies don't have any assets in the countries issuing compulsory trade secret licenses. \"The US government could allow a foreign government to bring a claim in a US court, but that's unlikely,\" he said.</p>", "date": "2021-05-26 11:39:00", "meta_title": "IP waiver talks hinge on use of Big Pharma's trade secrets", "meta_keywords": "COVID-19, Vaccines, Intellectual property, Waivers, Trade secrets, Law360, Moderna, Pfizer", "meta_description": "IP waiver talks hinge on use of Big Pharma's trade secrets", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-26 11:38:15", "updated": "2021-05-26 11:46:43", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ip-waiver-talks-hinge-on-use-of-big-pharma-s-trade-secrets", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "patent_innovation_money.jpg", "image2id": "patent_innovation_money_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "World Health Organization", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Patents & Trademarks, Production, Public health", "geography_tag": "Global", "company_tag": "Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-26 11:39:00"}
