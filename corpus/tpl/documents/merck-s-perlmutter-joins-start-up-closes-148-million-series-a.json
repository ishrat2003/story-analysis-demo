Super-resolution microscopy was first developed by Eric Betzig, and collaborators, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014 for this work. Dr Betzig, Xavier Darzacq, Luke Lavis, and Robert Tjian, founded Eikon to industrialize this novel technology and to apply the tracking of protein dynamics to key applications across the drug discovery process.</p>\n<p>Prior to joining Eikon, Dr Perlmutter was an executive vice president at Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) and president of Merck Research Laboratories. Under his R&amp;D leadership, Merck received more than 100 regulatory approvals for its medicines and vaccines globally, including those for multiple cancers, diabetes, and infectious diseases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The pharmaceutical industry has long been limited in the tools available to study dynamic regulatory mechanisms in living cells,&rdquo; said Dr Perlmutter, adding: &ldquo;In this context, it is inspiring to see what Eikon has already accomplished by incorporating physics and engineering along with machine learning to complement traditional drug discovery approaches. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to work with Drs Betzig and Tjian, whom I have known for many years, and with the engineers, computer scientists, chemists and biologists at Eikon, with whom I have interacted during the past year, to identify and develop important new therapeutics.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-05 12:31:00", "meta_title": "Merck's Perlmutter joins start-up; closes $148 million Series A", "meta_keywords": "Eikon Therapeutics, Launches, Financing, Series A, Appointment, Roger Perlmutter, CEO,", "meta_description": "Merck's Perlmutter joins start-up; closes $148 million Series A", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-05 12:30:43", "updated": "2021-05-05 12:36:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-s-perlmutter-joins-start-up-closes-148-million-series-a", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "boardroom-large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "boardroom-small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Boardroom, Business Financing, Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Management", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eikon Therapeutics, Merck & Co", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-05 12:31:00"}
