It is planned, the new strategy will create conditions for their more active production within the territory of the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to production, there are also plans to continue procurement of these pathogenetic drugs, particularly those that are primarily recommended to treat orphan diseases and that these will primarily be purchased by the recently-established Circle of Kindness state foundation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Stanislav Naumov, chairman of the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of the Eurasian Economic Union, it is also important to continue the development of the domestic production of active ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr Naumov comments: &ldquo;The pandemic, which led to disruptions in the supply of active ingredients from China, has confirmed the importance of the full localization of all pharmaceutical production cycles at the national level. At present, only 10% of drugs available in the Russian market are made from Russian ingredients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Need for new insurance system</strong></h2>\n<p>In the meantime, according to Lilia Titova, head of the Russian Union of Professional Pharmaceutical Organizations, a new state strategy should also ensure a more active development of a system of drug insurance in Russia.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pilot projects for certain groups of patients in this area have existed for many years, but now, thanks to the introduction of electronic prescriptions, it has become possible to extend them to the entire population,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analysts believe the existing presidential fund alone is not enough to help orphan patients, there is also a need reconsider the methods of procurements in Russia and to abandon public procurement procedures under Federal Law-44, given a priority to offset contracts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, according to them, there is also a need to introduce the practice of risk-sharing, when the state pays the full cost of drugs only if their use really improved the patient's health.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-16 10:20:00", "meta_title": "Russia plans new strategy for pharmaceutical sector until 2030", "meta_keywords": "Russia, Government, Strategy, Innovation, Production, Insurance, Pharma 2030", "meta_description": "Russia plans new strategy for pharmaceutical sector until 2030", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-15 18:31:37", "updated": "2021-03-16 10:20:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-plans-new-strategy-for-pharmaceutical-sector-until-2030", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "russia_moscow_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "russia_moscow_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Production, Research, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-16 10:20:00"}
