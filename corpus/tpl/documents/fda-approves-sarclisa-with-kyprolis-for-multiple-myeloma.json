{"contentid": 488244, "importid": NaN, "name": "FDA approves Sarclisa with Kyprolis for multiple myeloma", "introduction": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved French pharma major Sanofi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc), in combination with Amgen's Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received one to three prior lines of therapy.", "content": "<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved French pharma major Sanofi&rsquo;s (Euronext: SAN) Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc), in combination with Amgen's (Nasdaq: AMGN) Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This marks the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-sarclisa-for-patients-with-relapsed-refractory-multiple-myeloma\">second FDA approval for Sarclisa</a>, which is also cleared in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adults with RRMM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.</p>\n<p>The FDA approved this application three months ahead of the FDA goal date, the agency noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Competition with Darzalex</strong></h2>\n<p>Sarclisa is targeting a market currently led by Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) Darzalex (daratumumab). J&amp;J has also been able to secure approval for a new subcutaneous formulation of Darzalex, dubbed <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-darzalex-fasbro\">Darzalex Faspro</a>, offering a much faster and easier mode of administration.</p>\n<p>Analysts have suggested that peak sales of up to $1 billion could be realistic for Sarclisa, while Darzalex is already exceeding $4 billion in annual revenues.</p>\n<p>The efficacy and safety of isatuximab-irfc in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in IKEMA (NCT03275285), a multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, two-arm, Phase III trial in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who had received one to three prior lines of therapy. The trial randomized 302 patients (3:2) to receive isatuximab-irfc with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Isa-Kd) or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd).</p>\n<h2><strong>Reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 45%</strong></h2>\n<p>In this study, Sarclisa added to Kd (Sarclisa combination therapy) reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 45% (hazard ratio 0.548, 95% CI 0.366-0.822, p=0.0032) versus standard of care Kd alone in patients with multiple myeloma. The median progression free survival (PFS) for Sarclisa combination therapy was not reached at the time of the pre-planned interim analysis, according to Sanofi.</p>\n<p>\"Treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma remains challenging and the prognosis for patients experiencing multiple relapses unfortunately is poor,\" said Dr Peter Adamson, global development head, oncology and pediatric innovation, at Sanofi. \"With this approval, Sarclisa is now included in two standard of care regimens for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma as early as first relapse. Today's milestone further supports our ambition for Sarclisa to become the anti-CD38 of choice for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma,\" he added.</p>\n<p>In February this year, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for a second indication for Sarclisa, in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd), for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.</p>", "date": "2021-04-02 16:23:00", "meta_title": "FDA approves Sarclisa with Kyprolis for multiple myeloma", "meta_keywords": "Sanofi, Sarclisa, Kyprolis, Myeloma, Multiple, FDA, Approval", "meta_description": "FDA approves Sarclisa with Kyprolis for multiple myeloma", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-02 16:21:16", "updated": "2021-04-03 13:46:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-sarclisa-with-kyprolis-for-multiple-myeloma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "2020_sanofi_big.jpg", "image2id": "2020_sanofi_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "France, USA", "company_tag": "Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "Darzalex, Kyprolis, Sarclisa", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-02 16:23:00"}
