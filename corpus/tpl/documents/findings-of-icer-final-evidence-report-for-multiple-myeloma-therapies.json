Shadowing these new treatments are concerns that the pricing for the first approved CAR-T agent in multiple myeloma exceeds a reasonable level for its given benefit. Manufacturers should restrain their pricing and work with payers to ensure that payment mechanisms and overall benefit coverage can help patients from all walks of life get affordable access to these treatments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Belantamab appears to deliver more modest overall clinical benefit, but clinical experts believe it too will have a role in therapy. At its current pricing, belantamab appears to meet commonly cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness, but our independent appraisal committee determined that its long-term value for money was &lsquo;low&rsquo; due to questions about the magnitude of overall survival benefit and certain favorable assumptions within the economic model.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-12 10:20:00", "meta_title": "Findings of ICER Final Evidence Report for multiple myeloma therapies", "meta_keywords": "ICER, Final, Evidence, Muliole myeloma, Bristol Myers, bluebird bio, Abecma, Janssen, Legend Biotech, Ciltacabtagene, GlaxoSmithKline, Blenrep", "meta_description": "Findings of ICER Final Evidence Report for multiple myeloma therapies", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-12 10:10:06", "updated": "2021-05-12 10:20:59", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/findings-of-icer-final-evidence-report-for-multiple-myeloma-therapies", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "icer_big.jpg", "image2id": "icer_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "bluebird bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, Legend Biotech", "drug_tag": "Abecma, Blenrep, ciltacabtagene autoleucel", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-12 10:20:00"}
