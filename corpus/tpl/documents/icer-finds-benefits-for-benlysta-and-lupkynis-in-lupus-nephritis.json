Despite substantial uncertainty that remains about longer-term use and outcomes with both treatments, their estimated net price in the market is aligned with their anticipated clinical benefits for patients.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Key clinical findings</strong></h2>\n<p>In the clinical trials, belimumab increased the complete renal response and primary efficacy renal response at two years compared with standard therapy alone, with benefits seen after the first year appearing stable at year two. There were no significant increases in adverse events or discontinuations compared with standard induction therapy for LN.</p>\n<p>Voclosporin nearly doubled the complete response and markedly increased the partial response at one year compared with standard therapy alone. Adverse events were comparable to standard induction therapy for LN, but the FDA added a black box warning consistent with that of cyclosporin for possible serious infections and malignancies.</p>\n<p>Based on this evidence, ICER determined that there is high certainty that both belimumab and voclosporin provide at least a small net health benefit compared to usual care, with the possibility of a substantial benefit (&ldquo;B+&rdquo;).</p>\n<h2><strong>Key cost-effectiveness findings</strong></h2>\n<p>The ICER&rsquo;s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range for belimumab is between $45,000-$61,000 per year, while the ICER estimates that belimumab&rsquo;s actual annual net US price is approximately $43,000 for patients remaining on treatment. ICER&rsquo;s HBPB for voclosporin is between $72,000-$101,000 per year, while ICER estimates that voclosporin&rsquo;s actual annual net US price is $92,000 for patients remaining on treatment.</p>\n<p>The HBPB is a price range suggesting the highest US price a manufacturer should charge for a treatment, based on the amount of improvement in overall health patients receive from that treatment, when a higher price would cause disproportionately greater losses in health among other patients in the health system due to rising overall costs of health care and health insurance. In short, it is the top price range at which a health system can reward innovation and better health for patients without doing more harm than good.</p>", "date": "2021-03-13 16:08:00", "meta_title": "ICER finds benefits for Benlysta and Lupkynis in Lupus nephritis", "meta_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline, Benlysta, Aurinia Pharma, Lupkynis, Lupus nephritis, ICER reviews, Effectiveness, Value", "meta_description": "ICER finds benefits for Benlysta and Lupkynis in Lupus nephritis", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-13 16:06:26", "updated": "2021-03-13 16:15:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-finds-benefits-for-benlysta-and-lupkynis-in-lupus-nephritis", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "icer_big.jpg", "image2id": "icer_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Canada, UK, USA", "company_tag": "Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline", "drug_tag": "Benlysta, Lupkynis", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-13 16:08:00"}
