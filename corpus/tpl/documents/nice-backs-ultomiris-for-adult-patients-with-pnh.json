Ultomiris is expected to become the successor in PNH to Alexion's own Soliris.</p>\n<h2><strong>New standard of care for patients with PNH</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;We are delighted at the recommendation from NICE, meaning we will be able to offer ravulizumab as a new treatment option to adult patients with PNH across the UK, helping to improve their overall quality of life,&rdquo; said Sean Richardson, Alexion general manager, UK &amp; Ireland. &ldquo;We believe ravulizumab will become the new standard of care for patients with PNH by providing immediate and complete C5 inhibition, sustained throughout the eight-week dosing interval,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>PNH is a debilitating ultra-rare blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis) as well as risk of blood clots (thrombosis), which can occur throughout the body, and result in organ damage and premature death.</p>\n<p>It impacts approximately 16 people per million in the UK, and can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s.</p>\n<p>PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis ranging from one to more than five years. The prognosis of PNH can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis &ndash; in addition to appropriate treatment &ndash; is critical to improving patient outcomes.</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 15:16:00", "meta_title": "NICE backs Ultomiris for adult patients with PNH", "meta_keywords": "Alexion Pharma, Ultomiris, PNH, Paroxysmal, Nocturnal, Hemoglobinuria, Approval, NICE", "meta_description": "NICE backs Ultomiris for adult patients with PNH", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 15:13:45", "updated": "2021-04-15 15:23:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nice-backs-ultomiris-for-adult-patients-with-pnh", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "alexion-logo-big.jpg", "image2id": "alexion-logo-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Alexion Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Soliris, Ultomiris", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 15:16:00"}
