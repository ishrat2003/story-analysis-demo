The funding has been provided under the DBT's 'Mission COVID Suraksha (cover) - The Indian COVID-19 Vaccine Development Mission'. It is being implemented by DBT's public sector undertaking Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC).</p>\n<h2><strong>Biotech support</strong></h2>\n<p>Renu Swarup, secretary, DBT, and chairperson, BIRAC, said at the onset of COVID-19, DBT backed many vaccine development programs, including the mRNA-based vaccine. \"A year back, this was a new technology and never used for vaccine manufacturing in India,\" she said.</p>\n<p>However, believing in the potential of this technology, DBT provided seed funding to Gennova to develop this technology platform amenable to scale-up and production.</p>\n<p>Gennova, in collaboration with HDT Biotech Corporation, USA, has developed the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine - HGCO19, the DBT said, adding: \"The DBT has been hand-holding Gennova right from the start.\"</p>\n<p>HCCOG19 is an indigenously developed vaccine on a mRNA platform. mRNA vaccines are considered safe as mRNA is non-infectious, non-integrating in nature, and degraded by standard cellular mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The move augurs well for India as it could give the country another option to battle the pandemic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Vaccine basket</strong></h2>\n<p>The matter of augmenting the basket of vaccines available for fighting the pandemic as well as to accelerate the pace and coverage of domestic vaccination program was discussed in the 23rd meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 held on April 11, 2021.</p>\n<p>After comprehensive deliberation, it was recommended that vaccines for COVID-19, which have been developed and are being manufactured in foreign countries and which have been granted emergency approval for restricted use by US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, the UK&rsquo;s MHRA, PMDA Japan or which are listed in WHO the (Emergency Use Listing) may be granted emergency use approval in India, mandating the requirement of post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial in place of conduct of local clinical trial as per the provisions prescribed under the Second Schedule of the New Drugs &amp; Clinical Trials Rules 2019.</p>\n<p>In a meeting chaired by Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog, it was noted the decision will facilitate quicker access to foreign vaccines by India and would encourage imports including import of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill and finish capacity etc, which will in turn, provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability for domestic use.</p>\n<p>\"We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J and others...to be ready to come to India as early as possible,\" said Dr Paul, also the chairman of the National Expert Committee on Vaccine Administration.</p>\n<h2><strong>Heavy demand</strong></h2>\n<p>The DBT had recently informed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, that the estimated manufacturing capacity of the Serum Institute of India's (SII) Covishield is 70-100 million doses every month, while Bharat Biotech's Covaxin has a planned production capacity of 12.5 million a month (150 million doses a year).</p>\n<p>The SII is in the midst of upscaling its total vaccine manufacturing capacity from 1.6 billion doses per year currently to over 2.3 billion doses of vaccines annually. It will also increase its Covishield manufacturing capacity to 100 million doses per month.</p>\n<p>SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla has sought a grant of $399 million from the government to ramp up Covishield production beyond 100 million doses per month, which SII is expected to reach by the end of May.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other vaccine makers, including Biological E and Gennova, have sought support from the DBT to avail funds from the $119 million Covid Suraksha fund, set up by the government, to accelerate their vaccine programme. Bharat Biotech has also sought $19 million for its facilities at Hyderabad and Bengaluru.</p>\n<h2><strong>More vaccines</strong></h2>\n<p>Five more vaccines are expected to get approval this year. The list includes J&amp;J (Bio E), Zydus Cadila, Serum's Novavax and a nasal vaccine from Bharat Biotech. Russian-made Covid vaccine Sputnik V was also cleared for emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India.</p>\n<p>Among the COVID-19 vaccine undergoing trials, Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila's ZyCov-D is in Phase III trials. The company has created an in-house manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per year and has also roped in a contract manufacturer for additional capacity of about 150 million doses per year.</p>\n<p>Hyderabad-based Biological E has signed a contract-manufacturing deal for producing 600 million doses of J&amp;J's COVID-19 vaccine per year. The single-shot vaccine has already been approved in the US and the company is reportedly preparing to start its clinical trials in India.</p>\n<p>Cumulatively, Indian vaccine manufacturers, including the SII, Bharat Biotech, Panacea Biotech, Sanofi's Shanta Biotech, Biological E, Hester Biosciences and Zydus Cadila, have an installed capacity to manufacture 8.2 billion doses of different vaccines per year. If required, this capacity can be tweaked to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines.</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 12:23:00", "meta_title": "India seeks import of COVID-19 vaccines; move to bolster domestic prod", "meta_keywords": "COVID-19, Vaccines, Import, Production, Domestic, Gennova, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila", "meta_description": "India seeks import of COVID-19 vaccines; move to bolster domestic producers", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 12:20:33", "updated": "2021-04-14 12:31:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-seeks-import-of-covid-19-vaccines-move-to-bolster-domestic-producers", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "india_flag_big.jpg", "image2id": "india_flag_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Production", "geography_tag": "India", "company_tag": "Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 12:23:00"}
