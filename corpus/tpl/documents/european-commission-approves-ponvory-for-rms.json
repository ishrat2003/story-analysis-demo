Analysts have forecast peak potential sales of $200 to $400 million for ponesimod.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Relapsing multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and complex disease that can present very differently from individual to individual, placing a heavy burden on the patient and their loved ones,&rdquo; said Professor Gavin Giovannoni, Professor of Neurology at Queen Mary University of London, adding: &ldquo;I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s approval of ponesimod as an additional treatment option for those living with relapsing multiple sclerosis - it will provide patients with additional choice when making decisions about their treatment.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The EC approval of ponesimod is based on data from the Phase III OPTIMUM trial,<sup>&nbsp;</sup>a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled superiority study of 1,133 adult patients (aged 18-55 years) in 28 countries. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily oral ponesimod (20mg) versus once-daily teriflunomide (14mg), marketed by Sanofi as Aubagio, which is widely-used first-line oral treatment, in adult patients with RMS.</p>\n<p>The large, Phase III study showed superior efficacy of ponesimod 20mg on the primary endpoint, annualized relapse rate (ARR), with a rate reduction of 30.5% (p&lt;0.001) compared with teriflunomide. Ponesimod also showed statistically-significant superiority on one of the secondary endpoints, combined unique active lesions (CUALs). Ponesimod significantly reduced the number of new inflammatory lesions on brain MRI by 56% (p&lt;0.0001) at week 108 when compared to teriflunomide.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Switzerland-based Idorsia Pharmaceuticals (SIX: IDIA), the company spun out of Actelion Pharmaceuticals which was acquired by J&amp;J for $30 billion in 2017, entered into the revenue-sharing agreement in respect to ponesimod. Under the terms of that deal, Idorsia is entitled to receive quarterly payments of 8% of the net sales of ponesimod products from Actelion.</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 15:24:00", "meta_title": "European Commission approves Ponvory for RMS", "meta_keywords": "Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, Ponvory, Ponesimod, Multiple sclerosis, RMS, European Commission, Approval, Idorsia Pharma", "meta_description": "European Commission approves Ponvory for RMS", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 15:23:18", "updated": "2021-05-25 15:30:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/european-commission-approves-ponvory-for-rms", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "janssen_ponvory_large.png", "image2id": "janssen_ponvory_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Multiple sclerosis", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, USA", "company_tag": "Idorsia, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson", "drug_tag": "ponesimod, Ponvory", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 15:24:00"}
