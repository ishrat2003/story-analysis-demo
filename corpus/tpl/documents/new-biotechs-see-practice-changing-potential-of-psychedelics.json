is possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important, the firm hopes to become the only group to offer a drug which can produce powerful therapeutic benefits without the hindrance of potential hallucinogenic effects.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In research recently published in Cell, Delix describes DLX-1, a compound derived from a common psychedelic substance, which it believes can act on beneficial pathways in this manner.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;a rewiring of the brain&rdquo; is possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief executive Mark Rus tells The Pharma Letter his firm now has &ldquo;well over five hundred well-characterized psychedelic analogs at varying stages of pre-clinical characterization&rdquo; being rapidly advanced, starting with DLX-1 and its first runner, DLX-7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firm is using a novel biosensor dubbed psychLight to help identify these novel compounds, which are known as psychoplastogens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proprietary technology enables the firm to predict the hallucinogenic potential of the compounds without depending only on animal testing, a difference which could prove critical in the firm&rsquo;s ability to expedite development.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Psychedelics on the rise</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New research, including from London&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dujs/2020/03/15/psychedelics-and-mental-health-a-therapeutic-breakthrough\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imperial College</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and from </span><a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/6039314ec645352a335785ab_Jama_Psychiatry_Davis_2020_Psilocybin_MDD.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johns Hopkins</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Baltimore, shows that people with depressive disorders reacted positively to psilocybin-assisted therapy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has helped many to the conclusion that psychedelics could hold untapped potential in treating multiple neurological disorders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work has its </span><a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/starting-a-medical-cannabis-business\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">analog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the medical cannabis business, where newly-formed biotechs are looking to overcome the stigma associated with using recreational drugs for medicinal purposes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with therapeutic cannabis-based drugs such as GW Pharmaceuticals' (Nasdaq: GWPH) Epidiolex (cannabidiol), researchers are looking to leverage the pharmacological properties of these compounds to unlock a range of therapeutic modalities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is an increasingly crowded space, with new entrants including the UK&rsquo;s COMPASS Pathways (Nasdaq: CMPS), Mind Medicine (OTCQB: MMEDF), Numinus Wellness (OTCPK: LKYSF) and Field Trip Health (OTCQX: FTRPF).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another competitor, Cybin (OTCQB: CLXPF) is already in the clinic with Phase II trials underway for its lead candidate CYB003, a deuterated psychedelic tryptamine being developed to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, in Berlin, another Phase IIa study has been initiated by Atai Life Sciences, which is studying RL-007 as an option for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS).</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Psychoplastogens</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Delix remains coy about its target indications for DLX-1 and DLX-7, Mr Rus says the compounds &ldquo;are very potent in the prefrontal vertex&rdquo; which &ldquo;lies at the core of several DSM and other neurological disorders.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;We have a great base of existing shareholders and in the future we'll seek and secure the funding necessary to continue.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Formerly group vice president for Neuroscience at Shire - the rare disease specialist bought by Takeda (TYO: 4502) for $62 billion - Mr Rus sees huge potential for the therapeutic approach selected by Delix.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Many people say neuroscience now is where oncology used to be twenty years ago,&rdquo; he says, adding &ldquo;we're rapidly advancing DLX-7 at DLX-1 in particular towards IND-enabling work with the goal of being in the clinic in the near future.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asked about his firm&rsquo;s business strategy in terms of funding, Mr Rus says: &ldquo;We have a great base of existing shareholders and in the future we'll seek and secure the funding necessary to continue.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of long-term business strategy, the company is flexible, with the potential for listing, partnering or commercializing products independently.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr Rus says: \"Our goal is to look back in 2030 and to have built a leading neuroscience company focused on delivering neuroplasticity therapeutics.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"That means not just developing but also commercializing the assets that are core to us.
