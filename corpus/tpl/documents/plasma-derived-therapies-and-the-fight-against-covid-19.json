Little may be known about plasma-derived therapies in the world at large, but the COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on this form of treatment and highlighted its wider uses in everyday medicine.</p>\n<p>Plasma-derived medicinal products and recombinant proteins are typically used to treat rare, serious, genetic, and &mdash; in many cases &mdash; life-threatening diseases caused by defective immune systems or by missing or non-functioning proteins typically found in blood plasma. These include autoimmune disorders and inherited disorders of&nbsp;hemostasis. Plasma-derived therapies also play an important role in emergency medicine.</p>\n<p>As our understanding of the novel coronavirus grew, the relevance of this area of pharmaceutical medicine and healthcare quickly became apparent. In response to the pandemic, the main global players in plasma-derived medicinal products, including LFB, joined together as the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, to accelerate the development of a hyperimmune immunoglobulin investigational therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>\n<h2>A collective effort</h2>\n<p>Simply put, plasma from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that could help suppress the virus and support that person&rsquo;s immune system to respond to the infection and ultimately, increase their chance of recovery. This therapy may also be important for those unable to receive a vaccine, such as someone who is immune-compromized.</p>\n<p>Throughout the project, the technical expertise of certain companies has been essential to develop analytical testing which meets WHO International Standards, to ensure convalescent plasma collection and plasma supply quality in accordance with the required quality standards, and for batch manufacturing facilities.</p>\n<p>Besides the CovIg-19 Plasma Alliance, many companies in the sector also responded directly to support frontline healthcare services through donations of plasma related materials and equipment. LFB, for example, provided immunoglobulin free of charge to the Paris University Hospitals Group (GHU Paris) as part of the ICAR clinical trial including patients infected by SARS Cov-2, and have provided gowns, masks or funding to a number of hospitals.</p>\n<p>Collective efforts have also been made to develop antibodies which might combat early stages of the COVID-19 infection. One such candidate is XAV-19, manufactured by LFB as part of a partnership with the French biotech Xenothera. It contains a mixture of protective antibodies aimed at neutralizing the virus and preventing respiratory failure that would require intensive care treatment.</p>\n<h2>A complex manufacturing process</h2>\n<p>The process by which plasma-derived therapies are manufactured is both fascinating and complex. Plasma supplied at facilities licensed for fractionation is put through a rigorous testing process and then fractionated to obtain specific plasma proteins which are concentrated and purified to make high quality medicines. This process is lengthy and may take up to several months before therapies reach the patients who need them.</p>\n<p>There are also relatively few production sites around the world for these medicines and so staff frequently need to be trained from the ground up when working in this area. As a result, it can take several years to reach the level required to run and supervise key parts of the manufacturing<br />process.</p>\n<p>Threats from new viral strains are something we will continue to face in the future. In order for them to be mitigated, however, we have to continue to work together in collaboration with academic teams and other companies in this area to understand them and develop new therapies when needed.</p>\n<h2>The impact of the pandemic on plasma collection</h2>\n<p>With various lockdown restrictions across the globe, however, lower volumes of plasma donations started to be observed. To avoid any negative impact on supply for these patients who rely on plasma-derived medicinal products year-round, both industry and healthcare systems have had to develop contingency plans.</p>\n<p>Of course, one way to combat declining donation rates is to increase awareness within public communities that donations are needed now more than ever. To address this need, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance has gained support from large organizations outside the plasma industry.</p>\n<p>One of the key goals of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is to be an effective partner for important institutions such as the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), while also developing a potential roadmap for regulation that can give health authorities globally the confidence to streamline the approval process of plasma derived therapies for COVID-19. Indeed, the NIAID is sponsoring a pivotal Phase III trial which aims to test the safety and efficacy of a combination treatment regimen including the hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19 patients in the hospital setting to see whether treating patients at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms reduces the risk of significant illness.</p>\n<h2>Improvements for patients with rare genetic disorders</h2>\n<p>At LFB, we see the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance as the continuation and development of collaboration within the sector as we develop partnerships and provide innovative solutions for patients globally. Thus, we make our resources available to fight COVID-19 beside our daily commitment to provide medication to patients during the pandemic. While respecting the safety rules, our employees are proud that manufacturing operations during the global pandemic and localized lockdowns have never stopped, so the supply of our vital plasma-derived medicinal products and recombinant proteins has continued.</p>\n<p>It is hoped by the industry that the heightened profile of this area of medicine during the pandemic will now have a long-term benefit for both public and regulatory understanding of these vital therapies, and of the need for donations, resulting in improved treatments for patients with rare genetic disorders around the world.</p>", "date": "2021-03-05 17:35:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "plasma, patients, plasma-derived, COVID-, therapies, medicinal, important, pandemic, process, Alliance, fight, develop, companies, medicine, proteins, View", "meta_description": "Patrick Delavault, executive VP, scientific & medical affairs, LFB Biopharmaceuticals, provides an Expert View on how the\u00c2\u00a0pandemic has led to a focus on an impo", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-05 13:04:46", "updated": "2021-03-05 17:36:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/plasma-derived-therapies-and-the-fight-against-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "patrick_delavault_large.jpg", "image2id": "patrick_delavault_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders, Hematology, Immunologicals, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Expert View, Focus On, In Depth", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": "Plasma-derived medicinal products", "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-05 17:35:00"}
