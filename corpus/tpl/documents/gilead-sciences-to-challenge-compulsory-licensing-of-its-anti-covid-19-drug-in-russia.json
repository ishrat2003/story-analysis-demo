The Russian firm <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russian-drugmakers-start-production-of-generics-without-patent-holder-s-ok\">began producing its generic in February</a> this year.</p>\n<p>In the decree, Mr Mishustin refers to the Russian Civil Code, which allows the use of such a mechanism in the interests of national security, while the patent holder will be provided with monetary compensation. The amount of compensation was not disclosed. This was the first time a compulsory license for the production of a drug was issued in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>State decision criticized by Gilead </strong></h2>\n<p>Alexei Brevnov, PR-director of Gilead Sciences Russia, said in an interview with the Russian Vedomosti, that this decision is counterproductive, since the price set by the company for the drug already allows to reduce the cost of combating coronavirus in any country in the world.</p>\n<p>According to Mr Brevnov, the information on the patents indicated in the compulsory license order contained inaccuracies. He added that there is also an unmet demand for Veklury in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to him, the demand for a generic is very limited, which indicates no urgent need for a compulsory licensing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr Brevnov also said that the approach for determining the cost of this drug does not correspond to the pricing method for vital and essential drugs in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before getting permission from the government, Pharmsynthez had talks with Gilead, but the latter refused to grant it a voluntary license, after which the Russian company made a request to the Russian government.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In its letter, Pharmsynthez referred to the high price of the original Veklury and promised to provide all patients who need the drug at a lower cost.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Questions on pricing</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the government procurement website, since the beginning of 2021, Remdeform purchases have totalled more than 180 million roubles ($2.4 million). Over the same time, the original Veklury was not purchased. According to the register of maximum selling prices for vital and essential dugs the maximum cost of Remdeform should not exceed 7,400 roubles per pack while the price for Veklury last year was set at 11,544 roubles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most of interviewed lawyers believe Gilead has no chance of challenging the government's order.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Sergei Uchitel, partner of the Pen &amp; Paper Bar Association, the main question to be resolved by the court is whether the conditions for issuing a compulsory license were met. These, according to him, include the presence of an emergency situation in the country or circumstances of extreme necessity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That became the first case for the issue of a compulsory license in the Russian pharmaceutical market. Prior to this, some local companies have made a number of attempts to receive such permissions. For example, Nativa has been trying for several years to obtain compulsory licenses in arbitration courts for the production of multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya (fingolimod), which is patented by the Swiss giant Novartis (NOVN: VX), as well as the anticancer drug Nexavar (sorafenib) from Germany&rsquo;s Bayer (BAYN: DE).</p>\n<p>Analysts have not ruled out the possibility that Nativa will try to use the latest case as an argument, but they doubt the success of the case. In the situation with remdesivir, the issue of a compulsory license was more clear, due to the shortage of an original drug in the market and the impossibility of releasing an analogue due to the patent restrictions.</p>", "date": "2021-04-27 16:15:00", "meta_title": "Gilead Sciences challenges compulsory licensing of its anti-COVID-19 d", "meta_keywords": "Gilead Sciences, Challenge, Compulsory licensing, Veklury, Remdesivir, COVID-19, Pharmsynthez, Remdeform", "meta_description": "Gilead Sciences challenges compulsory licensing of its anti-COVID-19 drug in Russia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-27 16:12:18", "updated": "2021-04-27 16:24:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gilead-sciences-to-challenge-compulsory-licensing-of-its-anti-covid-19-drug-in-russia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "gilead-big.jpg", "image2id": "gilead-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Patents & Trademarks, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Pharmsynthez", "drug_tag": "Remdeform, Remdesivir, Veklury", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-27 16:15:00"}
