Findings from the primary efficacy and safety endpoints and additional secondary objectives will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.</p>\n<h2><strong>Study design</strong></h2>\n<p>This multicenter US Phase IIa study enrolled 202 non-hospitalized adults who had signs or symptoms of COVID-19 within seven days and confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary efficacy objective was reduction in time to viral negativity measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. Periodic samples were collected for virologic analysis. Of the 182 participants with an evaluable nasopharyngeal swab, 42% (78/182) showed detectable levels of cultured virus at baseline. Other Phase II and Phase II/III studies are underway.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to share our initial Phase II infectivity data at this important conference, which remains at the forefront for critical clinical scientific information in infectious diseases,&rdquo; shared Dr Wendy Painter, chief medical officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, adding: &ldquo;At a time where there is unmet need for antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, we are encouraged by these preliminary data.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The secondary objective findings in this study, of a quicker decrease in infectious virus among individuals with early COVID-19 treated with molnupiravir, are promising and if supported by additional studies, could have important public health implications, particularly as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to spread and evolve globally,&rdquo; noted Dr William Fischer, lead investigator of the EIDD-2801 2003 study and Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We continue to make progress in our Phase II/III clinical programs evaluating molnupiravir in both outpatient and hospital settings and plan to provide updates when appropriate,&rdquo; said Dr Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories.</p>\n<h2><strong>Offers a simple twice-a-day tablet</strong></h2>\n<p>If the drug comes to market, it would offer a simple twice-a-day tablet that could be given to millions of patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus, preventing them from becoming seriously ill and helping them recover more quickly.</p>", "date": "2021-03-08 10:16:00", "meta_title": "Preliminary Phase IIa trial results of molnupiravir in COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, Ridgeback Bio, Phase IIa, Molnupiravir, EIDD-2801, MK-4482, COVID-19", "meta_description": "Preliminary Phase IIa trial results of molnupiravir in COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-07 14:53:52", "updated": "2021-03-08 10:16:16", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/preliminary-phase-iia-trial-results-of-molnupiravir-in-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "merck_large.jpg", "image2id": "merck_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-virals, Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics", "drug_tag": "EIDD-2801, MK-4482, molnupiravir", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-08 10:16:00"}
