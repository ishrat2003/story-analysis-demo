The resulting CPABs will undergo clinical development that will be jointly managed by both companies.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\">\"The next wave of cancer therapeutics\"</span>I-Mab will have an exclusive license to commercialize the CPABs in Greater China, with the rest of the world commercialization rights being equally owned by both companies. In return, Complix is entitled to receive an undisclosed upfront payment and potential development milestones fees, as well as tiered royalties.</p>\n<p>CPABs are a new class of small proteins engineered to bind to a variety of antigens. Data available show that CPABs have the potential to address a wide range of disease targets, particularly intracellular targets that are difficult for current therapies to reach.<br /> <br />In addition to crossing cellular membranes, alphabodies have the potential to cross the blood brain barrier to address CNS diseases and to be delivered orally given their ability to cross the gut wall.</p>\n<p>Mark Vaeck is chief executive of Complix, which is backed by a syndicate of experienced life sciences investors, through which it has raised close to $ 40 million to date.</p>\n<p>He said: &ldquo;We are looking forward to developing novel CPAB drug candidates that have a beneficial therapeutic impact on the two I-O targets put forward by I-Mab. We are also happy to be working with a partner with the ability and commitment to commercializing these products in Greater China and to have retained a commercial interest in these CPABs in the rest of the world, providing us with an additional opportunity to generate shareholder value.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Taylor Guo, chief scientific officer of I-Mab, said: &ldquo;The partnership with Complix is part of our strategy to create a new cycle of pipeline programs, as our current set of assets advances rapidly towards late-stage clinical development and Biologics License Application.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As a company pushing the boundaries on innovation, I-Mab is anchoring its efforts in new medicines that have transformative potential. We have been impressed with the data that Complix has generated to support the unique ability of its CPAB platform to address intracellular targets, and we believe that these CPABs are pioneering the next wave of cancer therapeutics that can potentially address the unmet needs in patient and clinical care.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-10 16:45:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Complix, I-Mab, CPABs, deal, targets, drug, potential, address, bags, specialist, Chinese, immuno-oncology, discovery, signed, biopharma, Belgian, clinical", "meta_description": "Belgian biopharma Complix has signed a drug discovery deal with Chinese immuno-oncology (I-O) specialist I-Mab.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-10 16:32:23", "updated": "2021-03-10 17:30:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/complix-bags-i-mab-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "i-mab_biopharma_large.jpg", "image2id": "i-mab_biopharma_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing", "geography_tag": "Belgium", "company_tag": "Complix, I-MAB", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-10 16:45:00"}
