The White House has not said where it plans to send the supplies.</p>", "date": "2021-04-27 10:54:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "vaccine, supplies, European, anticipated, AstraZeneca, firm, sues, excess, donates, developer, Union, launched, legal, action, Belgian, courts, Friday, liv", "meta_description": "As anticipated, the European Union launched a legal action against AstraZeneca in the Belgian courts on Friday, alleging the British firm failed to live up to i", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-27 10:53:57", "updated": "2021-04-27 11:52:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eu-sues-vaccine-developer-while-usa-donates-excess-supplies", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "europe_flag_eu_big.jpg", "image2id": "europe_flag_eu_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Legal, Production, Public health", "geography_tag": "Europe, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-27 10:54:00"}
