Both studies met their primary endpoints of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline for Beovu 6mg versus aflibercept 2mg at year one.</p>\n<p>In KESTREL, patients on Beovu 6mg gained a mean of 9.2 letters versus 10.5 letters for patients on aflibercept 2mg. In KITE, patients on Beovu 6mg gained a mean of 10.6 letters versus 9.4 letters for patients on aflibercept 2mg.</p>\n<p>In pre-specified secondary endpoints, fewer eyes treated with Beovu had intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid (IRF/SRF) at week 32 (first assessment of disease activity) and week 52 versus eyes treated with aflibercept. More eyes treated with Beovu 6mg than eyes treated with aflibercept achieved central subfield thickness (CSFT) levels below 280 &mu;m at weeks 32 and 52. Fluid is a key marker of disease activity in DME and CSFT is a key indicator of fluid in the retina.</p>\n<p>Beovu injection was approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Europe in February last year, and for the same indication in the USA in October 2019.</p>\n<h2><strong>Competition and sales forecasts</strong></h2>\n<p>Beovu compete Regeneron (Nasdaq: REGN) and Bayer&rsquo;s (BAYN: DE) Eylea (aflibercept). The Evaluate group has suggested that Beovu has a net present value of $5.59 billion. GlobalData has previously forecast that, at its peak, Beovu can bring in between $4.1 billion and $7 billion in sales. At the same time, Eylea sales will likely drop from their peak of $2.6 billion to $1.5 billion by 2026, according to the data and analytics company.</p>\n<p>Novartis is committed to bringing Beovu 6mg to market for DME patients, subject to regulatory approvals, and will be submitting these one-year data from the KESTREL and KITE trials to global health authorities in first-half 2021. Novartis anticipates two-year results from KESTREL and KITE later in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to share these data, which underscore Beovu&rsquo;s potential to address an unmet need in the DME landscape,&rdquo; said Jill Hopkins, global development unit head, Ophthalmology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, adding: &ldquo;With these data demonstrating vision gains, fluid resolution and the potential for less frequent injections for eligible patients, we are one step closer to providing DME patients with a potential new treatment option.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-02 14:02:00", "meta_title": "Positive Phase III results for Novartis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Beovu IN DME", "meta_keywords": "Novartis, Beovu, Brolucuzumab, DME, Phase III, Macular edema, Diabetic", "meta_description": "Positive Phase III results for Novartis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Beovu IN DME", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-02 14:00:57", "updated": "2021-05-02 14:09:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-phase-iii-results-for-novartis-beovu-in-dme", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novartis-eye-big.jpg", "image2id": "novartis-eye-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes, Ophthalmics", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Novartis", "drug_tag": "Beovu, brolucizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-02 14:02:00"}
