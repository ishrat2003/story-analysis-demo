There are 13 million doses of vaccine waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to COVAX as part of the company&rsquo;s commitment to supply millions of doses to low-income countries. The vaccine was made outside the European Union (EU) and brought to the Anagni plant to be filled into vials. The EU fully supports supplying low-and middle-income countries through the COVAX facility, AstraZeneca pointed out.</p>\n<p>There are another 16 million doses waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Europe. Approximately 10 million doses will be delivered to EU countries during the last week of March, and the balance to be delivered in April as the doses are approved for release after quality control.</p>\n<p>It is incorrect to describe this as a stockpile, AstraZeneca stressed. The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed.</p>", "date": "2021-03-25 10:27:00", "meta_title": "India delays exports of AstraZeneca shot; Italian situation explained", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, COVID-19, Vaccine, Exports, Hold, Indiam government, Serum Institute of India, Stockpiling, Italy, AZD1222", "meta_description": "India delays exports of AstraZeneca shot; Italian situation explained", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 10:26:13", "updated": "2021-03-25 10:35:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-delays-exports-of-astrazeneca-shot-italian-situation-explained", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_large.png", "image2id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Production", "geography_tag": "Europe, India, Italy, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Serum Institute of India", "drug_tag": "AZD1222, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-25 10:27:00"}
