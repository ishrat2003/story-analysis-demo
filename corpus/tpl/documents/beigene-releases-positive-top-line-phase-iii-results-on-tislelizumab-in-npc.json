The safety profile of tislelizumab was consistent with its known risks, with no new safety signals identified with the addition of chemotherapy, said BeiGene, whose shares closed up 4.6% at HK$205.80.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are excited to see a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in our Phase III trial for tislelizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with NPC. This is our fifth positive Phase III readout for tislelizumab, which we are developing broadly as a potentially differentiated anti-PD-1 antibody,&rdquo; said Dr Yong Ben, chief medical officer, Immuno-Oncology, at BeiGene, adding: &ldquo;We are grateful for the patients and clinicians who participated in this trial and hopeful that they may have a new treatment option in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>BeiGene plans to discuss these data with health authorities and present data at an upcoming medical conference.</p>\n<h2><strong>Partnered with Novartis</strong></h2>\n<p>In January 2021, BeiGene and Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) entered into a <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-buys-rights-to-beigene-s-checkpoint-inhibitor\">collaboration and license agreement</a> granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, Japan and other ex-China markets, in exchange for an upfront payment of $650 million plus royalties and milestone payments of up to $1.55 billion.</p>\n<p>BeiGene has now been paid twice for tislelizumab; it previously had a deal with Celgene but this was terminated in 2019 following that group&rsquo;s takeover by Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). Celgene gave BeiGene $263 million up front and also made a $150 million equity investment; BeiGene also got a $150 million break-up fee as a result of the termination.</p>\n<p>The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted tislelizumab market authorization in four indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>In addition, three supplemental Biologics License Applications for tislelizumab have been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA and are under review for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, for second- or third-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy, and for patients with previously treated unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>", "date": "2021-05-22 14:32:00", "meta_title": "BeiGene releases positive top-line Phase III results on tislelizumab i", "meta_keywords": "BeiGene, Phase III, Tislelizumab, NPC, Cancer, Nasopharyngeal, Novartis", "meta_description": "BeiGene releases positive top-line Phase III results on tislelizumab in NPC", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-22 14:31:18", "updated": "2021-05-22 14:39:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/beigene-releases-positive-top-line-phase-iii-results-on-tislelizumab-in-npc", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "beigenebig.png", "image2id": "beigene-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "China, Switzerland", "company_tag": "BeiGene, Novartis", "drug_tag": "tislelizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-22 14:32:00"}
