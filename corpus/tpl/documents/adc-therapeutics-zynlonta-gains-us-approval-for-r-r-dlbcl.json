{"contentid": 488446, "importid": NaN, "name": "ADC Therapeutics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Zynlonta gains US approval for r/r DLBCL", "introduction": "On Friday, Swiss antibody-drug conjugate specialist ADC Therapeutics saw its shares gain almost 5% to $24.40 after-hours, as it revealed that the US Food and Drug Administration has granted accelerated approval for Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl).", "content": "<p>On Friday, Swiss antibody-drug conjugate specialist ADC Therapeutics (NYSE: ADCT) saw its shares gain almost 5% to $24.40 after-hours, as it revealed that the US Food and Drug Administration has granted accelerated approval for Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl).</p>\n<p>The drug is cleared for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.</p>\n<p>Zynlonta is the first and only CD19-targeted antibody drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of r/r DLBCL. Zynlonta fills a significant unmet need in r/r DLBCL in heavily pre-treated patients with difficult to treat disease and has the potential to become the standard of care in 3L+ DLBCL. The 3L+ DLBCL total market consists of 10,500 patients in the USA/EU5 and represents a $1 billion+ opportunity, according to the company.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The accelerated approval of Zynlonta, which came ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of May 21, is based on data from the LOTIS-2 trial, which demonstrated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robust single-agent activity across a broad patient population;</li>\n<li>48.3% overall response rate, 24.1% complete response rate, durable responses in heavily pre-treated patients;</li>\n<li>Median duration of response of more than 10.3 months (BLA submission); 12.6 months for all responders and 13.4 months for patients who had a complete response (more mature data since the submission); and</li>\n<li>Manageable toxicity profile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FDA approval is strong validation of the company&rsquo;s ADC platform and lead product, which also has the potential to be used in combination and in additional indications and lines of treatment, the company noted. ADC Therapeutics&rsquo; proprietary PBD dimer toxins make Zynlonta highly potent. The PBDs cross link in the DNA of cancer cells, enabling them to elude DNA repair/cancer resistance mechanisms. This allows for a longer-lasting effect on cancer cells.</p>\n<p>Zynlonta will be commercially available in the USA shortly. ADC Therapeutics has launched the Advancing Patient Support Program, a comprehensive patient support program offering financial assistance, ongoing education and other resources to eligible patients who are prescribed Zynlonta.</p>", "date": "2021-04-24 15:45:00", "meta_title": "ADC Therapeutics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Zynlonta gains US approval for r/r DLBCL", "meta_keywords": "ADC Therapeutics, Zynlonta, Loncastuximab teserine, Lymphoma, B-cell, r/r DLBCL, Cancer, Blood, FDA, Approval", "meta_description": "ADC Therapeutics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Zynlonta gains US approval for r/r DLBCL", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-24 15:42:42", "updated": "2021-04-26 16:34:19", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/adc-therapeutics-zynlonta-gains-us-approval-for-r-r-dlbcl", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "adc_therapeutics_large.png", "image2id": "adc_therapeutics_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "ADC Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "loncastuximab tesirine, Zynlonta", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-24 15:45:00"}
