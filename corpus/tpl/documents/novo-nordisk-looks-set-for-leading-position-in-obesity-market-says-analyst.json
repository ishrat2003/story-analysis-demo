Despite some safety concerns, regarding predominately gastrointestinal adverse events, the unprecedented efficacy data from the STEP1 trial demonstrates that semaglutide has the potential to become the leading marketed therapy for obesity.</p>\n<p>Akash Patel, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;With more than a third of patients losing over 20% of their body weight, these are incredibly promising results. KOLs interviewed by GlobalData have expressed a keen interest in prescribing semaglutide as it offers a highly efficacious therapeutic option for tackling obesity in patients with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D).&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Likely to cannibalize Saxenda</strong></h2>\n<p>Semaglutide is already a highly prescribed GLP-1 therapy for T2D, marketed as a subcutaneous (Ozempic) and oral formulation (Rybelsus). If approved for obesity, semaglutide could rapidly cannibalize sales of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s leading obesity drug Saxenda (liraglutide), a once-daily subcutaneous GLP-1 therapy, due to its superior efficacy and dosing regimen. Transferring patients to semaglutide is likely to be a key priority for Novo Nordisk before Saxenda loses patent protection. Saxenda generated sales of around $900 million last year.</p>\n<p>Fiona Chisholm, pharma analyst at GlobalData, adds: &ldquo;Political incentive to address obesity is at an all-time high, with policies such as the UK&rsquo;s Soft Drinks Industry Levy coming into effect in recent years, particularly as the link between obesity and poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients has been well publicized throughout the pandemic. The STEP1 results highlight the potential for pharma to play a greater role in tackling the obesity crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-04 11:30:00", "meta_title": "Novo Nordisk looks set for leading position in obesity market, says an", "meta_keywords": "Novo Nordisk, Semaglutide, Saxenda, Obesity, Market position, GlobalData", "meta_description": "Novo Nordisk looks set for leading position in obesity market, says analyst", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-04 11:29:20", "updated": "2021-03-04 11:37:03", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novo-nordisk-looks-set-for-leading-position-in-obesity-market-says-analyst", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novo_nordisk_big.jpg", "image2id": "novo_nordisk_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Obesity", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes, Metabolics, Nutritional disorders", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Denmark", "company_tag": "GlobalData, Novo Nordisk", "drug_tag": "Saxenda, semaglutide", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-04 11:30:00"}
