The agency stated that the BICR reconciliation and re-read process may have introduced unmeasured bias and influence on the BICR.</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA requests new trial</strong></h2>\n<p>The agency recommended that Athenex conduct a new adequate and well-conducted clinical trial in a patient population with metastatic breast cancer representative of the population in the USA. The agency determined that additional risk mitigation strategies to improve toxicity, which may involve dose optimization and/or exclusion of patients deemed to be at higher risk of toxicity, are required to support potential approval of the NDA.</p>\n<p>Athenex plans to request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the agency&rsquo;s response, engage in a dialogue on the design and scope of a clinical trial to address the FDA&rsquo;s requirements and align on the next steps required to obtain approval.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our clinical and regulatory teams are disappointed by the complete response letter,&rdquo; said Dr Rudolf Kwan, chief medical officer of Athenex. &ldquo;We plan to work with the Agency to resolve the issues raised in the CRL and to obtain approval for oral paclitaxel plus encequidar in metastatic breast cancer,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are surprised and disappointed by the FDA&rsquo;s decision to issue a complete response letter for oral paclitaxel and encequidar,&rdquo; said Dr Johnson Lau, chief executive of Athenex, adding, &ldquo;We remain committed to the breast cancer community and will explore the best path forward to obtain regulatory approval.
