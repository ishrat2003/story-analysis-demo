However, in younger patients there remain some concerns, related in particular to these rare cases.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Steps are being taken to update the product information for the vaccine to include more information on these risks, and PRAC is continuing to investigate, including looking at the safety of other COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image: Rob Acket</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 18:09:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 18:06:23", "updated": "2021-03-18 18:25:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-view-unchanged-on-astrazeneca-jab-despite-possible-link-to-blood-clots", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket.jpg", "image2id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Blood clots, Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, Sweden, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 18:09:00"}
