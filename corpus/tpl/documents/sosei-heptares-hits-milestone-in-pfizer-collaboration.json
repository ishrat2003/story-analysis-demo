This candidate was nominated for advancement by Pfizer in December 2019 generating a $3 million milestone payment at that time.</p>\n<p>Pfizer nominated three distinct clinical candidates from the collaboration with Sosei Heptares during 2019, all of which are now progressing in Phase I clinical trials. These candidates have also now been disclosed by Pfizer as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PF-07081532 (an oral GLP1 receptor agonist for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity)</li>\n<li>PF-07054894 (a CCR6 antagonist targeting inflammatory bowel disease) and</li>\n<li>PF-07258669 (an MC4 receptor antagonist for anorexia)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This candidate is the ninth GPCR-targeted drug candidate overall originating from Sosei Heptares' StaR technology and structure-based drug design (SBDD) platform to enter clinical trials.</p>\n<p>Dr Rob Cooke, chief technology officer of Sosei Heptares, said: \"The start of clinical trials with this new clinical candidate is a further important milestone in our highly productive and longstanding collaboration with Pfizer. It is a clear demonstration of the power of our structure-based design and discovery capabilities when combined with the complementary development expertise of a truly collaborative partner. This productivity is further exemplified by the fact that nine candidates derived from our platform have entered clinical trials across multiple disease areas, with more than 20 active programs underway either with partners or in house. This broad portfolio of exciting new drug candidates has potential to address significant unmet need globally and generate significant future value for shareholders.\"</p>\n<p>Sosei Heptares and Pfizer entered a multi-target <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/heptares-therapeutics-enters-drug-discovery-collaboration-with-pfizer\">drug discovery collaboration</a> in November 2015 to research and develop potential new medicines directed at GPCR targets across multiple therapeutic areas. Many of these targets have clinical or biological validation as key points for therapeutic intervention potentially targeting a range of diseases but have proven difficult to address with conventional discovery approaches because of inherent technical challenges.</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 12:15:00", "meta_title": "Sosei Heptares hits milestone in Pfizer collaboration", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, Sosei Group, Sosei Heptares, Collaboration, Milestone, Payment, Diabetes, Bowel disease, Anorexia", "meta_description": "Sosei Heptares hits milestone in Pfizer collaboration", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 12:14:52", "updated": "2021-05-21 12:21:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sosei-heptares-hits-milestone-in-pfizer-collaboration", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sosei_heptares_large.jpg", "image2id": "sosei_heptares_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes, Gastroenterology, Metabolics", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Pfizer, Sosei Group, Sosei Heptares", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 12:15:00"}
