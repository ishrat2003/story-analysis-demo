However, back in 2016, Pfizer announced that it planned to invest about $350 million in the Hangzhou facility.</p>\n<h2><strong>Site capacities</strong></h2>\n<p>The state-of-the-art 50,000 m<sup>2</sup> facilities, GMP operational since 2018, includes DS capacities equipped with 2x2000L single-use bioreactors expandable to 4x2000L (MFG20) and DP capacities of vial filling (DP9) and pre-filled syringe (DP10). Leveraging the facilities' experienced workforce and WuXi Biologics' extensive expertise in manufacturing and regulation, the production is expected to commence shortly after the deal closure.&nbsp;&lsquo;</p>\n<p>Early last year, WuXi entered a deal take over the operations of one of Bayer's (BAYN: DE) final drug product manufacturing plants, located at the German pharma major&rsquo;s Leverkusen headquarters. Terms of that deal were also not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the news, Pfizer noted that \"the site was planned to manufacture three biosimilars for the China market.\" However, it added, that it had \"commercially and technically evaluated other products for the site, but none reached the level of activity for the scale of the site.\"</p>\n<p>Dr Chris Chen, chief executive of WuXi Biologics, said: \"We are pleased to work with Pfizer and add the new Hangzhou biologics manufacturing facilities to our global network to address the surging manufacturing demands for late-stage and commercial projects due to the success of our Win-the-Molecule strategy. Globally DS and especially DP capacities are in urgent need now. The acquisition will allow us to better enable our global partners to develop and manufacture premier-quality biologics to benefit patients around the world.\"</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 11:30:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, WuXi Biologics, Acquisition, Manufacturing facility, Hangzhou", "meta_description": "Pfizer to quit making biosimilar in China; sells out to WuXi", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": "Pfizer to quit making biosimilar in China; sells out to WuXi", "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 11:28:52", "updated": "2021-03-18 11:36:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pfizer-to-quit-making-biosimilar-in-china-sells-out-to-wuxi", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "wuxi_large_new.jpg", "image2id": "wuxi_small_new.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Production", "geography_tag": "China, USA", "company_tag": "Pfizer, WuXi Biologics", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 11:30:00"}
