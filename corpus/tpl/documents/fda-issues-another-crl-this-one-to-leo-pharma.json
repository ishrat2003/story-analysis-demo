The FDA has not raised any questions to the clinical efficacy or safety of tralokinumab, but only requested additional data relating to a device component of the combination product. We will now work closely with the FDA to address their request and bring tralokinumab to the U.S. patients as quickly as possible,&rdquo; said J&ouml;rg M&ouml;ller, executive vice president, global R&amp;D at LEO Pharma.</p>\n<p>The BLA submission was based on efficacy and safety results from the ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3 pivotal Phase III trials, which included more than 1,900 adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Safety data was evaluated from a pool of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, including ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3, a dose-finding trial, and a vaccine response trial.</p>\n<p>Many, though not all, of the CRLs issued recently by the FDA have been a result of the agency being unable to carry out manufacturing inspections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as for example one issued yesterday to Protalix BioTherapeutics. Several CRLs were also issued for supplemental BLAs, seeking full approval for drugs that had been cleared under the agency&rsquo;s accelerated process, indicating a tougher stance from the FDA.</p>\n<h2><strong>Commercial prospects</strong></h2>\n<p>If approved, tralokinumab is expected to be the first biologic treatment in the atopic dermatitis space to challenge Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) and Regeneron&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: REGN) Dupixent (dupilumab), and analysts at GlobalData have forecast peak sales of $1.6 billion for the LEO drug, while they see Dupixent revenues exceeding $5 billion.</p>\n<p>LEO Pharma received a positive opinion for tralokinumab from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on April 22, 2021.</p>\n<p>LEO acquired rights to tralokinumab from AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) in 2016, in a deal involving an upfront payment of $116 million and a possible further $1 billion in milestone payments to AstraZeneca.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-29 16:11:00", "meta_title": "FDA issues another CRL, this one to LEO Pharma", "meta_keywords": "LEO Pharma, Tralokinumab, Atopic, Dermatitis, CRL, Complete response letter, FDA, Device", "meta_description": "FDA issues another CRL, this one to LEO Pharma", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-29 16:09:35", "updated": "2021-04-29 16:18:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-issues-another-crl-this-one-to-leo-pharma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "leo-pharma-big.jpg", "image2id": "leo-pharma-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Dermatologicals", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Denmark, USA", "company_tag": "LEO Pharma", "drug_tag": "tralokinumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-29 16:11:00"}
