Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Incidence of infection in teens</strong></h2>\n<p>From March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2021, around 1.5 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years of age have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Children and adolescents generally have a milder COVID-19 disease course as compared to adults. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart, the same dosage and dosing regimen for 16 years of age and older.</p>\n<p>The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria to amend the EUA, and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine&rsquo;s use in this population.</p>\n<p>Children make up around 20% of the total US population, according to government data, noted CNBC. Between 70% and 85% of the US population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity, experts say, and some adults may refuse to get the shots. Though more experts now say herd immunity is looking increasingly unlikely as variants spread.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo; said Dr Peter Marks, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. &ldquo;With science guiding our valuation and decision-making process, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that the available data meet our rigorous standards to support the emergency use of this vaccine in the adolescent population 12 years of age and older,&rdquo; he noted.</p>", "date": "2021-05-11 10:58:00", "meta_title": "FDA nod for emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in adole", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, BioNTech,  COVID-19, BNT162b2,  Vaccine, Adolescents, FDA, Emergency use", "meta_description": "FDA nod for emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in adolescents", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-11 10:55:31", "updated": "2021-05-11 11:05:27", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-nod-for-emergency-use-of-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-in-adolescents", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biontech_vaccine_large.jpg", "image2id": "biontech_vaccine_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "BioNTech, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "BNT162b2, COVID-19", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-11 10:58:00"}
