Although technically classified as a rare disease, amyloidosis has three distinct subtypes &ndash; AL (primary), AA (secondary), and ATTR. About 4,000 new cases are believed to be diagnosed annually in the United States alone.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The most common subtype of amyloidosis, the AL type, has an estimated prevalence rate of 40.5 cases per million person years, and the incidence has been steadily increasing at the rate of 12% per year.<sup>2</sup> With rising statistics, the disease remains poorly understood, and concerns remain about the current methods of managing this condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How is amyloidosis diagnosed?</strong></h2>\n<p>Amyloidosis diagnosis can be challenging. Indeed, 20% of AL amyloidosis patients experience a delay in diagnosis by as much as two years, while the wait is around 42% in patients suffering from the cardiac ATTRwt subtype of amyloidosis.<sup>3 </sup>While case history and clinical evaluation are taken into account, diagnosis is primarily made through a tissue biopsy. Once diagnosed, clinical subtyping of the disease is necessary, as this forms the basis of the management strategy. Another factor to be considered is the severity of amyloid-related organ dysfunction, especially advanced cardiac complications.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Once identified, the focus of treatment is to rescue organ function by suppressing the production of amyloidogenic free light chains (FLCs) and to minimize treatment-related mortality and morbidity.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the current state of AL amyloidosis management?</strong></h2>\n<p>For AL amyloidosis, a risk assessment is usually performed at the outset to inform management. The risk assessment primarily takes cardiac status into account, but also considers peripheral neuropathy, renal status and lung disease. A decade ago, the mainstay of treatment for patients was chemotherapy with high dose melphalan and dexamethasone (Mdex). At least 33% of patients receiving this therapy were known to recover completely, while organ function improved in 48% of patients and hematologic response improved in 67% of patients.<sup>5</sup> However, this therapy was associated with high morbidity rates, including the development of leukemia.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, low risk patients, who comprise about 20% of all AL amyloidosis patients, are managed with Autologous Stem Cell transplantation (ASCT). While initially associated with high mortality rates, careful risk assessment and patient selection has decreased mortality. ASCT can produce complete response in 35-37% of all patients, and hematological response in 71% of patients.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any novel treatments for AL amyloidosis?</strong></h2>\n<p>ASCT is highly dependent on patient selection. Novel treatments are emerging for patients who do not meet the selection criteria, as well as for intermediate or high-risk patients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Velcade (bortezomib; from Millennium/Takeda (TYO: 4502) and Janssen, a Johnson &amp; Johnson [NYSE: JNJ] company), a proteasome inhibitor, is becoming increasingly common as a pre-induction therapy before ASCT, or for &lsquo;consolidation&rsquo; after ASCT treatment. Bortezomib is also effective as monotherapy, but combinations with dexamethasone have shown better rates of progression-free survival.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Novel treatments have also looked at replacing the use of Alkeran (melphalan) in intermediate risk patients, who form about 65% of all AL amyloidosis patients. Bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone can provide a hematological response rate of 81%, which is comparable to bortezomib and Mdex, and superior to Mdex alone.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Recent studies have evaluated Darzalex (daratumumab; from Janssen Oncology), an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody originally used for multiple myeloma, for intermediate risk patients. Daratumumab has shown high rates of hematologic response (76 to 78%), a good response time, and a toxicity that is similar to that seen in multiple myeloma patients.<sup>10 </sup>High risk patients, who form the remaining 15 to 20% of patients, have limited treatment options that improve their long-term prognosis. Low-dose treatment with bortezomib is preferred and, if tolerated, newer therapeutic agents may be introduced.<sup>11</sup></p>\n<p>Several novel drugs have been introduced for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Thalidomide derivatives, including Revlimid (lenalidomide; Bristol Myers Squibb [NYSE: BMY]) and Imnovid (pomalidomide; Celgene) have demonstrated reasonable hematologic response rates. However, lenalidomide has been associated with renal dysfunction at higher doses.<sup>12 </sup>A new, oral proteasome inhibitor, Ninlaro (ixazomib; Millennium Pharmaceuticals/Takeda), has shown promise in relapse-refractory AL. It has also been shown to achieve a hematologic response in 52% and an organ response in 56% of patients.<sup>12</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any investigational treatments for AL amyloidosis?</strong></h2>\n<p>A proteasome inhibitor, Kyprolis (carfilzomib; from Amgen [Nasdaq: AMGN]), is currently being evaluated for AL amyloidosis patients who have peripheral neuropathy (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02545907\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT02545907). Another monoclonal antibody, Empliciti (elotuzumab; from Bristol Myers Squibb), is already approved to treat relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. In a single case report, elotuzumab achieved both hematologic and organ responses in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.<sup>13</sup> An ongoing clinical trial is evaluating the efficacy of elotuzumab and cyclophosphamide in relapsed AL amyloidosis (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT03252600).</p>\n<p>Venetoclax (VCL) is a selective oral antineoplastic, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor agent, approved for use in leukemia and multiple myeloma. VCL has produced promising findings in a single-center, retrospective study of 8 patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis with heart complications.<sup>14</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup>However, a Phase I trial (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT03000660) examining VCL in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed AL amyloidosis has been suspended due to the availability of data from another study indicating an increased risk of death with the agent (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: BELLINI trial: NCT02755597).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A newer monoclonal antibody being evaluated is CAEL-101, which can directly bind to human light chain amyloid fibrils to break down deposits. CAEL-101 has shown encouraging organ responses in Phase I trials, with cardiac function improving in 9 out 10 patients.<sup>15</sup> A Phase II multicenter study of CAEL-101, in combination with CyBorD (Cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone), in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis, is in the pipeline (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT04304144). &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the current status of the management of AA and ATTR amyloidosis?</strong></h2>\n<p>In the hereditary ATTR subtype of amyloidosis, the amyloid (transthyretin) is largely produced by the liver. Therefore, liver transplantation has been the treatment of choice. Conversely, since AA amyloidosis is associated with chronic inflammatory disease, the focus of management is the suppression of underlying inflammation. However, both of these standard therapies do not always prevent disease progression in other organ systems. Therefore, novel treatments are being sought that aim to retard or halt disease progression by preventing amyloid deposition or removing deposits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vyndaqel (tafamidis; from Pfizer [NYSE: PFE]) prevents amyloid deposition by binding to the transthyretin tetramer and preventing its dissociation (which is the first step in amyloid deposition). The drug has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular related hospitalizations in ATTR patients by about 30%.<sup>16</sup> Tafamidis is now Food and Drug Administration approved to treat both wild-type and mutated TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, has transthyretin binding capabilities and has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of neurological impairment and improve quality of life.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two recently approved drugs, Onpattro (patisiran; from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals [Nasdaq: ALNY]) and Tegsedi (inotersen; Akcea), are &lsquo;gene silencers.&rsquo; which prevent the synthesis of amyloid at the molecular level. In patients with hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy, an 18-month patisiran therapy was shown to significantly improve neuropathy, quality of life, and cardiac complications.<sup>18 </sup>Inotersen has also been shown to slow disease progression and improve quality of life.<sup>19</sup> However, inotersen is associated with adverse effects, including glomerulonephritis and thrombopenia in about 3% of all patients; hence, regular laboratory monitoring may be required.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>\n<p>Eprodisate is the only clinically proven drug to inhibit AA amyloid fibrillogenesis. It has been shown to reduce the risk of renal dysfunction by about 42%, but does not appear to reduce risk of end stage renal failure or mortality.<sup>20</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any investigational treatments for ATTR and AA amyloidosis?</strong></h2>\n<p>Tasmar (tolcapone; Meda Pharmaceuticals), primarily used as an adjunctive treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, has higher affinity for transthyretin than tafamidis and is also a better inhibitor of transthyretin aggregation. Since it can cross the blood-brain barrier, its efficacy is currently being evaluated for leptomeningeal amyloidosis (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT03591757).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An upcoming promising &lsquo;gene silencer&rsquo; is vutrisiran (Alnylam), which, in comparison with patisiran has shown better hepatic uptake despite a lower administration volume, promising better efficacy and stability<strong>. </strong>Vutrisiran also has a good safety profile.<sup>21</sup> Currently, two randomized Phase III trials are underway comparing the efficacy and safety of vutrisiran and patisiran in ATTRv patients with neurological (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03759379\">ClinicalTrials.gov HELIOS-A</a>: NCT03759379) and cardiac manifestations (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04153149\">ClinicalTrials.gov HELIOS-B</a>: NCT04153149).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>For AA amyloidosis, a specially designed new drug, NC-503, is undergoing Phase II/III trials for efficacy and safety (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00035334\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT00035334). This drug binds to amyloidogenic precursor proteins and prevents tissue deposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another potential method of treatment is to use therapies that would degrade amyloid deposits after they are formed. Doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has been shown to disrupt ATTR amyloid in mouse models. Further clinical trials testing doxycycline along with plasma cell-directed treatment are in progress.</p>\n<h2><strong>Biologics &ndash; an era of hope for amyloidosis&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Systemic amyloidosis has long presented a challenge to patients and physicians, both for diagnosis and optimal modes of management. The recent introduction of targeted biologics for all subtypes of amyloidosis promises new hope to patients living with amyloidosis. While earlier treatments were focused on removing the source of amyloid synthesis and lowering amyloid precursor proteins, newer classes of drugs being developed are targeting interference with amyloid deposition and degradation of existing deposits. This offers hope not only for improved survival, but also improved organ functioning and better quality for life for patients.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Amyloidosis - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders).
