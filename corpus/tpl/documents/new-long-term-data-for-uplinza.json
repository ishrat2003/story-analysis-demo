No clear association between low IgG levels and severe infection can be established.</li>\n<li>Infusion-related reactions during the N-MOmentum trial were generally mild, with no unexpected safety concerns identified during continued dosing in the OLP (<a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findex.mirasmart.com%2FAAN2021%2FPDFfiles%2FAAN2021-001941.html&amp;esheet=52412895&amp;newsitemid=20210416005099&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=P15.211&amp;index=3&amp;md5=ba610876058033012937c709a9f555a2\">P15.211</a>).</li>\n</ul>", "date": "2021-04-23 10:59:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Horizon Therapeutics, Uplinza, Inebilizumab-cdon, Long-term, Data, AAN 2021, NMOSD", "meta_description": "New long-term data for Uplinza", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": "New long-term data for Uplinza", "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-23 10:58:20", "updated": "2021-04-23 11:07:35", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-long-term-data-for-uplinza", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "horizon_large.jpg", "image2id": "horizon_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "AAN, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Horizon Therapeutics, Viela Bio", "drug_tag": "inebilizumab-cdon, Uplinza", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-23 10:59:00"}
