Kazia will also receive contingent milestone payments of up to $281 million for glioblastoma, with further milestones payable for indications beyond glioblastoma. Simcere will additionally pay to Kazia mid-teen percentage royalties on commercial sales.</li>\n<li>The transaction proceeds will be applied directly to the further development of paxalisib.</li>\n<li>Paxalisib is currently the subject of six additional studies in other forms of brain cancer beyond glioblastoma.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Analyst sees advantages for both companies</strong></h2>\n<p>This is a key development for Kazia because not only does this payment help alleviate the near-term financing needs of the company, but the deal illustrates the potential value of this asset to partners, noted Dr Nathaniel Calloway, an analyst at Edison Group.</p>\n<p>Paxalisib, by virtue of being in the Phase II/III GBM AGILE study, will be the most advanced development asset Simcere has in licensed, as its other clinical programs are in Phase I or earlier, commented Dr Calloway, who forecasts peak sales of paxalisib in the glioblastoma indication of $450 million.</p>\n<p>Kazia chief executive Dr James Garner commented: &ldquo;China is one of the world&rsquo;s largest pharmaceutical markets, with specific requirements and opportunities for innovative oncology products. We are delighted to partner with Simcere to secure the commercial success of paxalisib in this critical territory. Simcere&rsquo;s track record of success is unrivalled, and they bring to paxalisib first-class capabilities in clinical development, regulatory affairs, and commercialisation. We look forward to working closely with our new partners to make paxalisib available for Chinese patients as swiftly as possible.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-30 16:10:00", "meta_title": "Kazia out-licenses lead product in Greater China", "meta_keywords": "Kazia Therapeutics, Simcere Pharmaceutical, Paxalisib, Cancer, Brain, Glioblastoma, License, Greater China", "meta_description": "Kazia out-licenses lead product in Greater China", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-30 16:09:17", "updated": "2021-03-30 16:18:36", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/kazia-out-licenses-lead-product-in-greater-china", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "kazia_company.jpg", "image2id": "simcere_company.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing", "geography_tag": "Australia, China", "company_tag": "Kazia Therapeutics, Simcere Pharmaceutical", "drug_tag": "paxalisib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-30 16:10:00"}
