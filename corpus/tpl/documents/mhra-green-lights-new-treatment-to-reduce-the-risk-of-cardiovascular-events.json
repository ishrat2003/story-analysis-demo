{"contentid": 488433, "importid": NaN, "name": "MHRA green lights new treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events", "introduction": "The UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted a Marketing Authorization for Vazkepa (icosapent ethyl), according to Ireland-incorporated Amarin Corp.", "content": "<p>The UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted a Marketing Authorization for Vazkepa (icosapent ethyl), according to Ireland-incorporated Amarin Corp (Nasdaq: AMRN), whose New York-listed shares closed up 2% at $5.19 on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Vazkepa is cleared as a treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in high cardiovascular risk statin-treated adult patients who have elevated triglycerides (&ge;150&nbsp;mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor.</p>\n<p>The MHRA&rsquo;s license swiftly follows the European Medicine Agency advisory committee, CHMP, recommending authorization for icosapent ethyl on March 30, 2021. Approved to reduce triglycerides since 2012, icosapent ethyl, under the trade name Vascepa, was cleared in the USA as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in late 2019.</p>\n<p>Amarin&rsquo;s understanding is that icosapent ethyl is among the first products to be submitted and licensed through the MHRA&rsquo;s new &lsquo;reliance&rsquo; route following the end of the Brexit transition period. Icosapent ethyl has been identified as a new active substance with likely multi-factorial mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action contributing to reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl are not completely understood.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing </strong></h2>\n<p>Marketing authorization of icosapent ethyl, a fish oil-based agent, comes after a decade of designing and conducting evidence-based cardiovascular clinical outcomes research. In the landmark international, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven REDUCE-IT study in 8,179 statin-treated adult patients with moderately elevated triglyceride levels, were followed for a median duration of 4.9 years.</p>\n<p>Amarin&rsquo;s president and chief executive John Thero commented: &ldquo;We began developing icosapent ethyl in Europe more than a decade ago. We are very grateful to the many patients and physicians who contributed to the development and clinical study of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl can help to reduce strokes, heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients across Europe. We are dedicated to a rethinking of cardiovascular disease risk reduction in Europe with an emphasis on preventative care. We will work tirelessly throughout Europe to make icosapent ethyl available to all patients who may benefit from this therapy.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-23 00:00:00", "meta_title": "MHRA green lights new treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular e", "meta_keywords": "Amarin Corp, Vazkepa.
