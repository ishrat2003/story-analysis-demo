Empirico will use its <em>Precision Insights Platform</em>, a human genetics-focused discovery platform, to select up to five therapeutic targets. AbCellera will use its AI-powered antibody discovery technology to search and analyze natural immune responses to identify antibodies with the desired therapeutic properties against the selected targets.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Empirico will have the rights to develop and commercialize novel antibodies resulting from the collaboration. AbCellera will receive research payments and is eligible to receive downstream clinical and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales of products from Empirico. No further financial terms were revealed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest challenges in drug development is the lack of translation between pre-clinical models and human disease. Empirico&rsquo;s platform seeks to overcome this hurdle by uncovering causal relationships between human genetic variation and clinical outcomes to discover and validate targets,&rdquo; said Carl Hansen, chief executive and president of AbCellera.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Using our Precision Insights Platform, Empirico has discovered multiple genetically-validated targets for diseases with unmet medical need, several of which are amenable to modulation with therapeutic antibodies,&rdquo; said Dr Omri Gottesman, CEO and president of Empirico, adding: &ldquo;For these and future programs, our partnership with AbCellera empowers and enables us to rapidly translate therapeutic insights from human genetics into potential new medicines for patients in need.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 12:22:00", "meta_title": "AbCellera and Empirico collaboration", "meta_keywords": "AbCellera, Empirico, Collaboration, Multi-targets", "meta_description": "AbCellera and Empirico collaboration", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 12:22:01", "updated": "2021-04-15 12:29:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abcellera-and-empirico-collaboration", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "abcellera_large.jpg", "image2id": "abcellera_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Canada, USA", "company_tag": "AbCellera, Empirico", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 12:22:00"}
