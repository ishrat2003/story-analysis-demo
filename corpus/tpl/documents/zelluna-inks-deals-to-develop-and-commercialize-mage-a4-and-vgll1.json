Targeting NK cells with TCRs may unlock the potential to treat a wide range of currently untreatable cancers.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;These agreements mark an important milestone in the development of the pipeline for Zelluna. MAGE-A4 is emerging as one of the most promising clinically validated TCR targets for solid cancers. Recent autologous TCR-T data demonstrates responses across multiple solid tumors, and we are very excited by the prospect of developing an allogeneic TCR-NK product against this target. VGLL1 represents an exciting recently described novel antigen overexpressed in multiple solid tumors with high unmet need. Overall, the agreements with MD Anderson bring us closer to our vision of developing novel allogeneic TCR-NK cell therapy products that could potentially bring benefit to a substantial number of solid cancer patients,&rdquo; said Anders Holm, chief operating officer and head of business development at Zelluna.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;We continue to build our organization and pipeline edging closer to our purpose of saving life through innovative cancer targeting cell therapies. These agreements allow Zelluna to exclusively develop TCR-NK products against multiple cancers, highlighting our overall strategy to build on our pipeline with validated TCRs through in-licensing, partnerships and our recently initiated internal TCR discovery,&rdquo; added Namir Hassan, chief executive of Zelluna.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 15:53:00", "meta_title": "Zelluna inks deals on MAGE-A4 and VGLL1 targeting for solid tumors", "meta_keywords": "Zelluna Immunotherapy, MD Anderson, License, Agreements, MAGE-A4, VGLL1, Cancers, Solid", "meta_description": "Zelluna inks deals on MAGE-A4 and VGLL1 targeting for solid tumors", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 15:50:16", "updated": "2021-05-25 16:02:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/zelluna-inks-deals-to-develop-and-commercialize-mage-a4-and-vgll1", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "zelluna_big.png", "image2id": "zelluna_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Norway, USA", "company_tag": "MD Anderson Cancer Center, Zelluna Immunotherapy", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 15:53:00"}
