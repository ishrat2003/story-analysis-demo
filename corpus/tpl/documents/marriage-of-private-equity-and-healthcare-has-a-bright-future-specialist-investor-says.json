The business was carved out from US-listed drugmaker Perrigo (NYSE: PRGO), which was seeking to focus on its over-the-counter operations.&nbsp;Inflexion has since invested a further &pound;15 million in business development and the facilities in Leeds.</p>\n<p>Other healthcare companies in Inflexion&rsquo;s portfolio include Pharmaspectra, a provider of medical affairs data to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, and European LifeCare, which provides travel clinics and public vaccination programs and has had its hands full in recent months delivering parts of the COVID-19 vaccine in Denmark.</p>\n<p>So what is it that Inflexion looks for when seeking healthcare companies to invest in?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We take it case-by-case,&rdquo; Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said. &ldquo;We look at businesses that are generating strong growth, have high margins and have really ambitious management teams.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The areas we&rsquo;re interested in are niche pharma, pharma services such as companies supplying into the R&amp;D clinical journey and beyond like Pharmaspectra, medical devices, software into the life sciences industry &ndash; typically work-flow management tools &ndash; and animal health.\"</p>\n<p>Software in life sciences is the hottest area from a private equity perspective at the moment, Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;added.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think it will continue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The pandemic has forced the hands of quite a few stakeholders in the industry to adapt more to digital technologies. If you think about virtual trials and how the regulation has changed around that and how protocol has evolved to take that into account.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Adding value on top of investment</h2>\n<p>Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;would not be surprised to see plenty of money flooding into the generics sector, either.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I suspect many economies have had a bit of a wake-up call on the fact that they&rsquo;re under-investing in healthcare or, at least, the investment&nbsp;should be reallocated to different parts of the healthcare services that they&rsquo;re providing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean there&rsquo;s any more money to fund healthcare, so there will be some reallocations and I would have thought that the generics market will be a major beneficiary of that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In what is a competitive market, private equity firms have to persuade companies that they can add value to the business when they become a shareholder.</p>\n<p>Inflexion, for example, helps companies to expand technologically and geographically through its in-house digital teams and international offices, and employs former headhunters to build on the personnel front.</p>\n<p>Also important to what Inflexion does are its sector experts within healthcare and a commercial specialist to advise on improving companies&rsquo; sales operations, and it helps firms to grow through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).</p>\n<h2>'Huge opportunity'</h2>\n<p>Examples of this input include, on the human resources side, Inflexion sourcing a chief financial officer for Rosemont to help structure the business for rapid growth, and supporting on the technology elements of the carve out. There may also be opportunities to drive digital marketing, including through improving its remote communications with healthcare practitioners.</p>\n<p>Being able to make changes and wanting to grow rapidly is something that Inflexion looks for when assessing investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Inflexion is an organization that is run by some extremely ambitious individuals; that seeps all the way down through the team, and we like to see that mirrored in the teams that we&rsquo;re working with,\" Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said.</p>\n<p>The fact that healthcare is such a booming space at the moment, coupled with the growing realization that it can be a good match with private equity, can only be good news for both.</p>\n<p>Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Private equity, as a percentage of total deals &ndash; the number of transactions in M&amp;A markets in Europe &ndash; is about 8% within healthcare, and across all sectors, it&rsquo;s about 25%. So there&rsquo;s a huge penetration opportunity that means if you&rsquo;re an Inflexion or another specialist investor in the healthcare space, there are plenty of companies to invest in.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-23 11:09:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "healthcare, Inflexion, equity, private, companies, sciences, life, sector, money, business, MrLongsaid, teams, specialist, investment, businesses, ambitiou", "meta_description": "There has never been a better time to raise money for companies in the life sciences sector, according to\u00c2\u00a0Ben\u00c2\u00a0Long, partner at UK-headquartered private equity f", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-22 18:00:56", "updated": "2021-03-23 11:10:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/marriage-of-private-equity-and-healthcare-has-a-bright-future-specialist-investor-says", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ben_long_large.jpg", "image2id": "ben_long_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Business Financing, Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Feature, In Depth", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "Inflexion, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-23 11:09:00"}
