In non-clinical depression models it possessed more durable and potent effects than S-ketamine, and potentially a more favorable safety and tolerability profile. A Phase I, single ascending dose study has been completed for PCN-101 and a Phase II proof-of-concept study in TRD is planned to be initiated by Perception in the first half of 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>Terms of the deal</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the terms of the license, Otsuka will have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products containing PCN-101 in Japan. Otsuka will undertake development, regulatory, and commercialization activities in Japan, with input and guidance from both companies. Perception will receive an upfront payment of $20 million, which will help fund the company&rsquo;s overall development of treatments. In addition, Perception will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered, double-digit royalties on future sales.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Otsuka is one of the world&rsquo;s premier pharmaceutical companies in the neuropsychiatric space.&rdquo; said Terence Kelly, chief executive of Perception, adding: &ldquo;To have such a strong collaborator at this early stage of development is a significant vote of confidence in the potential of PCN-101 for patients suffering from depression.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Florian Brand, CEO and co-founder of atai, which this month closed a Series D $157 million financing round, said, &ldquo;Otsuka is dedicated to finding unconventional solutions to treat mental health disorders with a deepening focus on digital medicine. Its innovative approach to mental health paired with their experience in commercializing neuropsychiatric drugs as demonstrated by the successful roll-out of products such as Rexulti and Abilify Maintena, makes Otsuka a great company for us to work with. We look forward to working together with them on Perception&rsquo;s lead compound.&rdquo;000</p>\n<p>Makoto Inoue, president of Otsuka Pharmaceutical, remarked: &ldquo;We have a long and deep engagement in the CNS field, including our in-line products Rexulti, Abilify Maintena, and specific to the US, the first-in-the-world digital medicine, Abilify Mycite. Looking to the future, Perception Neuroscience&rsquo;s PCN-101, a candidate with rapid onset for use in treatment-resistant depression, could provide an urgently needed treatment option. Perception Neuroscience is uniquely positioned to work with us in Japan on this urgent task.</p>", "date": "2021-03-16 11:26:00", "meta_title": "Otsuka partners with atai unit on alternative ketamine-based treatment", "meta_keywords": "atai Life Sciences, Otsuka, Perception Neuroscience, PCN-101, Arketamine, License, Agreement, Depression, MDD,TRD", "meta_description": "Otsuka partners with atai unit on alternative ketamine-based treatments for depression", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-16 11:24:18", "updated": "2021-03-16 11:35:12", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/otsuka-partners-with-atai-unit-on-alternative-ketamine-based-treatments-for-depression", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "atai_life_sciences_large.png", "image2id": "atai_life_sciences_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Treatment-resistant depression", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, Japan", "company_tag": "ATAI Life Sciences, Otsuka, Perception Neuroscience", "drug_tag": "arketamine, PCN-101", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-16 11:26:00"}
