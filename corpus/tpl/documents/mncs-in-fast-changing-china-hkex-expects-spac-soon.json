The eczema treatment was added to China&rsquo;s national reimbursement drug list (NRDL) in January 2021, five months after it was approved in the country. In contrast, it takes about 17 months on average for a newly approved drug to get into the list.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This certainly was not an easy achievement. We made it because we have the best team,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>A best class commercialization team will be necessary once the drug is on the NRDL. &ldquo;You will have to think about whom you should partner with, how you do it, who&rsquo;s doing which part to meet each milestone. This is quite complicated,&rdquo; Dr Hornstein said.</p>\n<p>There are different approaches to commercialization, but the traditional way of hiring thousands of sales persons is clearly antiquated, said Dr Hornstein.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe the time for such hiring is over. We believe we will have to use a completely different approach in the next two to three years,&rdquo; he said. He was talking about going digital.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>China pushing society to go digital</strong></h2>\n<p>China is known for being aggressive in pushing the whole society to go digital and Sanofi has adapted itself to the trend. In recent years it has partnered with Chinese tech giants including Alibaba and Tencent to provide chronic disease management services. It is also the first multinational pharma in China that moved its entire workforce communication on WeChat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In a market as loud as China&rsquo;s, you have to be precise about what you do and who you target. Good science must be combined with targeted digital communication to boost success. Having medical representatives visit doctors all the over the country is far from enough,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<h2><strong>MNCs can benefit from great ecosystem, says Pfizer</strong></h2>\n<p>For Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), the buoyant Chinese market, backed by a growing number of innovative, ambitious Chinese biotechs, offers a great ecosystem that MNCs can benefit, said Pfizer Asia region president Pierre Gaudreault.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;China&rsquo;s booming biotech infrastructure allowed companies like us to involve in partnering with local biotechs that fit for China&rsquo;s innovation agenda,&rdquo; he said. In 2020 alone, Pfizer partnered with CStone to co-develop the latter&rsquo;s oncology asset sugemalimab, a PD L1 antibody; It chose LianBio to jointly explore novel therapies in China, and it signed up with the vaccine maker CanSino Bio to market the latter&rsquo;s proprietary meningococcal vaccine in China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The idea is to provide the value a MNC like Pfizer can bring to Chinese partners, and MNCs can benefit from Chinese companies&rsquo; knowledge and expertise,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr Gaudreault agreed with Sanofi&rsquo;s Dr Hornstein that digital is essential. Pfizer in November 2020 partnered with multiple online platforms, including Alibaba, JD and Ping An Good Doctor, to provide services to manage chronic diseases such as RA and eczema. This move was in line with Pfizer&rsquo;s plan to expand its businesses in rural areas in China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pfizer is very presented in big Chinese cities and now we are providing support to healthcare system in rural areas and small cities, and it is something we will put enormous efforts into in the years to come,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pfizer is also discussing with Chinese authorities about how to build an ecosystem to support local innovation to attract investments. Such discussions cover a wide range of topics, including drug reimbursement and regulatory processing ease, said Mr Gaudreault.</p>\n<p>Pricing is a challenge that every drug company in China has to face. Drastic price cuts threaten innovation which will certainly have consequences, said Dr Hornstein.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How can you attract companies to do novel research if the price is that low?&rdquo; he questioned. Sanofi&rsquo;s Dupixent, for example, had to cut the price by 50% to get into the NRDL.</p>\n<p>A major reason for Chinese authorities pursuing aggressive price cuts is that the national universal social insurance scheme still monopolizes the country&rsquo;s massive health insurance market. Despite the rising voices inside China warning such a monopoly could hinder drug innovation, the authorities gave no promise of change.</p>\n<h2><strong>But investors are nonetheless chasing Chinese biotechs</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2020, the HKEX saw 21 initial public offerings (IPOs) by Chinese biotech and healthcare companies, raising over HK$84.1 billion ($11 billion), more than doubled from 2019. Former HKEX chief executive Charles Li said at the conference that it is highly likely that the exchange will introduce its own Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) framework soon to attract more Chinese biotech start-ups.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the HKEX-version of SPAC could be ideal to bring smaller biotechs to the market because they either don&rsquo;t think about an IPO or are barely qualified for an IPO,&rdquo; Mr Li said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, he cautioned that unlike in the USA, where vetting, or background investigation is not a regulatory requirement for companies going public through a SPAC, the regulators in Hong Kong will make sure that vetting plays an important role in its SPAC framework.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you cannot use a SPAC as some sort of listing regulatory arbitrage,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Image: beijing_china_large_credit_bobby_mcgill_freeimages.</p>", "date": "2021-04-06 10:24:00", "meta_title": "MNCs in fast-changing China; HKEX expects SPAC soon", "meta_keywords": "Multinationals, China, Ecosystem, Market, Pricing, Digital, IPOs", "meta_description": "MNCs in fast-changing China; HKEX expects SPAC soon", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-05 12:24:59", "updated": "2021-04-06 11:12:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mncs-in-fast-changing-china-hkex-expects-spac-soon", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "china_big.jpg", "image2id": "china_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Business Financing, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Markets & Marketing, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "China, Hong Kong", "company_tag": "Pfizer, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "Dupixent", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-06 10:24:00"}
