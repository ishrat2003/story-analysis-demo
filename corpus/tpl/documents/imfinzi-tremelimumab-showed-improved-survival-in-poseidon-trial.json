Patients in this arm were treated with a short course of tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody, over a 16-week period in addition to Imfinzi and standard chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>The Imfinzi plus chemotherapy arm demonstrated a statistically-significant improvement in PFS versus chemotherapy in the previous analysis, but the OS trend observed in this analysis&nbsp;did not achieve statistical significance. Patients in the control arm were treated with up to six cycles of chemotherapy, while those in the experimental arms were treated with up to four cycles.</p>\n<p>Each combination demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified. The combination with tremelimumab delivered a broadly similar safety profile to the Imfinzi and chemotherapy combination and did not lead to an increased discontinuation of treatment.</p>\n<h2><strong>New approach will add a further option</strong></h2>\n<p>Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, Oncology Business Unit, said: &ldquo;We are pleased to see the POSEIDON Phase III trial demonstrate, for the first time, a significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit for Imfinzi plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We were particularly pleased by the safety profile. We&rsquo;ve seen encouraging uptake of novel combinations in this setting and believe this new approach will add a further option for patients with high unmet medical need. We look forward to discussing next steps with regulatory authorities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.</p>\n<p>Imfinzi, which generated sales of $556 million (up 20% year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021 for AstraZeneca, is the only approved immunotherapy in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy and is the global standard of care based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial. Imfinzi is also approved in the USA, the European Union, Japan and many countries around the world for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial.</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 10:15:00", "meta_title": "Imfinzi + tremelimumab showed improved survival in POSEIDON trial", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Imfinzi, Tremelimumab, Phase III, POSEIDON trial, Cancer, Lung, NSCLC", "meta_description": "Imfinzi + tremelimumab showed improved survival in POSEIDON trial", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 09:52:25", "updated": "2021-05-07 10:15:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/imfinzi-tremelimumab-showed-improved-survival-in-poseidon-trial", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca_big.jpg", "image2id": "astrazeneca_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Imfinzi, tremelimumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 10:15:00"}
