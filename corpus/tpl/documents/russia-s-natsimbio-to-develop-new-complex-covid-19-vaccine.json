A month later, head of Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, clarified that the new vaccine will be complex and will ensure protection against both COVID-19 and flu.

According to him, it will be registered either by the end of the current year or in early 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other details of the new vaccine are not disclosed, however, according to the Russian Forbes magazine, citing sources in the Russian Ministry of Health, the new vaccine will probably be based on technologies that are already used by Natsimbio for the production of its modern, tetravalent vaccine against influenza, Ultrax Quadri, as well as those used by the Russian Chumakov center.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Chumakov Center produces the so-called classic vaccines, when the virus is isolated, replicated in the laboratory conditions, and then used in a live but weakened form or in a \"killed,\" inactivated, being capable of triggering the immunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Karina Grishina, head of the Chumakov Center's coronavirus vaccine department, after receiving the fluid containing the virus, it is chemically inactivated, which takes place by adding a substance that destroys viral RNA, and the virus can't reproduce.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Professor Anatoly Altstein, an employee of the Russian Gamaleya Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, who developed the Sputnik V vaccine, if Natsimbio uses a technique like the Chumakov Center, it is possible to make two vaccines based on inactivated viruses &ndash; anti COVID-19 and influenza - and mix them to receive a complex bivaccine.</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 10:48:00", "meta_title": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Natsimbio to develop new complex COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_keywords": "Natsimbio, Complex, COVID-19, Influenza, Vaccine, Rostec", "meta_description": "Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Natsimbio to develop new complex COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 10:48:03", "updated": "2021-05-25 10:54:56", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-natsimbio-to-develop-new-complex-covid-19-vaccine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vaccines_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "vaccines_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Research, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "Natsimbio, Rostec", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 10:48:00"}
