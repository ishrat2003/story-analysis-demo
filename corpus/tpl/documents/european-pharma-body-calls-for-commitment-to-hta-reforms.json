One tested method is to foresee enough opportunities to evaluate and adjust the work being carried out and learn together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, what we all want is a system that improves the availability of innovative technologies for patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-29 10:21:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "European, assessments, pharma, proposal, negotiations, efficient, industry, member, states, joint, commitment, body, calls, reforms, region, technology", "meta_description": "A statement from the European pharma industry criticizes progress on a new proposal for making health technology assessments more efficient in the region.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-29 10:21:40", "updated": "2021-03-29 10:50:13", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/european-pharma-body-calls-for-commitment-to-hta-reforms", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "europe_flag_eu_big.jpg", "image2id": "europe_flag_eu_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": "EFPIA", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-29 10:21:00"}
