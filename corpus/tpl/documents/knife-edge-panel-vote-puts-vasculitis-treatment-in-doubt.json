scientific panel sent shares in California&rsquo;s ChemoCentryx (Nasdaq: CCXI) into free fall on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Carlos-based company has been developing avacopan for the treatment of a certain kind of vasculitis, known as AAV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee voted nine to nine on the question of whether the efficacy data support approval of avacopan in AAV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two other votes were marginally in the firm&rsquo;s favor, with 10 to eight voting both that the safety profile is adequate and that the benefit-risk profile is adequate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ChemoCentryx stock had already dropped precipitously after the US Food and Drug Administration released a </span><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/148176/download\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">briefing document</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ahead of

need for new treatment options.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said: &ldquo;We hope that the FDA will take into account the dire situation faced by patients living with this debilitating disease.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the US regulator is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory committees, they are a highly important component of the agency&rsquo;s decision-making process.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Avacopan&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avacopan is a first-in-class, orally-administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis and other complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firm is also developing avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and hidradenitis suppurativa
