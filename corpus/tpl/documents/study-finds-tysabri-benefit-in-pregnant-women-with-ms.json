{"contentid": 488548, "importid": NaN, "name": "Study finds Tysabri benefit in pregnant women with MS", "introduction": "A study by Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Monash University has highlighted the benefit for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who continue to take a disease-modifying treatment during and after pregnancy.", "content": "<p>A study by Australia&rsquo;s Monash University has highlighted the benefit for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who continue to take a disease-modifying treatment during and after pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Using data from the international MSBase registry, the findings published in Neurology, revealed that women with MS who continued to take natalizumab through and after their pregnancy, had a decrease in relapse rates by up to 89%.</p>\n<p>Natalizumab was brought to market by Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) under the brand name Tysabri.</p>\n<h2>'Incredibly valuable evidence'</h2>\n<p>The study found that women with MS who stopped taking natalizumab and another therapy, fingolimod, before conception had an increase in relapse rates.</p>\n<p>Fingolimod is sold under the name Gilenya by the Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX).</p>\n<p>Led by senior research fellow Vilija Jokubaitis from the department of neuroscience at Monash Central Clinical School, the study is the first to show how well the disease can be controlled through and after pregnancy if women are appropriately managed on disease-modifying therapies.</p>\n<p>Dr Jokubaitis said: &ldquo;Pregnant women are excluded from randomized-controlled trials of disease-modifying therapies and there is limited trial evidence to inform management through pregnancy and postpartum. Being able to analyse this data is incredibly valuable in providing evidence to change practice in clinical management of women with MS.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the past, women were advised to stop taking any MS medications in order to conceive. However, with such variability in how long conception might take, women were at increased risk of their disease activity returning while trying to become pregnant, often with terrible neurological consequences for the mother.</p>\n<h2>Significant increase in MS treatments</h2>\n<p>First author Wei Yeh, who is also a neurologist at The Alfred hospital, added: &ldquo;Relapse rates were previously thought to decrease during pregnancy among women with MS. However, our study shows that this is not the case for a subset of women with more active disease, who experience increases in relapse rates during pregnancy. These observations are important to guide our discussions and treatment strategy with the aim of minimizing relapse risk.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The study incorporated 1,619 women with MS who had 1,998 pregnancies conceived from 2011 onwards. This group was then compared to pregnancies conceived before 2005 up to 2010, looking at relapse rates before, during and after pregnancy to see how relapse rates and use of disease modifying treatment have changed over time, as there has been a significant increase in the number of more effective MS treatments over the past 15 years.</p>\n<p>Among the first was natalizumab, which was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004 and then later in Australia in 2006, before receiving reimbursement the following year. Other newer treatments include fingolimod, which won Australian approval in 2011, and dimethyl fumarate, a drug sold by Biogen under the name Tecfidera that was approved in Australia in 2013.</p>", "date": "2021-05-05 16:24:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "women, study, pregnancy, pregnant, relapse, benefit, rates, disease-modifying, treatment, Monash, natalizumab, Tysabri, disease, finds, multiple, continue", "meta_description": "A study by Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Monash University has highlighted the benefit for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who continue to take a disease-modifying tr", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-05 16:13:21", "updated": "2021-05-05 17:16:49", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/study-finds-tysabri-benefit-in-pregnant-women-with-ms", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "monash_big.png", "image2id": "monash_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological, Women's health", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Real-world evidence, Research", "geography_tag": "Australia, Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Biogen, Novartis", "drug_tag": "dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, Gilenya, Natalizumab, Tecfidera, Tysabri", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-05 16:24:00"}
