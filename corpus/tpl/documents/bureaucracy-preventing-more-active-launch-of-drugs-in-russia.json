The shortage is observed in the case of various drugs, including those that can be prescribed for the treatment of some serious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis and some others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Ravil Niyazov, a specialist in the development and regulation of drugs at the Russian Scientific Consulting Center, said in an interview with the Russian-language Meduza business paper, in addition to low prices and the existing restrictions on the participation of foreign drugmakers during state tenders in Russia, a number of existing regulatory barriers continue to prevent more active launch of drugs both by domestic and foreign drugmakers in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Excessive registration requirements</strong></h2>\n<p>According to Mr Niyazov, these barriers are primarily in the form of excessive registration requirements, some of which have protectionist origin, providing protection for domestic drugmakers. These requirements prevent more active launch of foreign drugs in the Russian market, despite the fact that the expansion of the range of original drugs in Russia may speed the launch of their domestic analogues in the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analyst believe that, with regard to the launch of new drugs, the Russian bureaucracy is thoughtless, while many of its requirements usually contradict each other.</p>", "date": "2021-03-02 12:13:00", "meta_title": "Bureaucracy preventing more active launch of drugs in Russia", "meta_keywords": "Drug launches, Registration, Bureaucracy, Tenders, Protectionist", "meta_description": "Bureaucracy preventing more active launch of drugs in Russia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-02 12:07:33", "updated": "2021-03-02 12:17:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bureaucracy-preventing-more-active-launch-of-drugs-in-russia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "russia_lake_stock_large.jpg", "image2id": "russia_lake_stock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Bureaucracy", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Focus On, Government Affairs, Product Launch, Regulation, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-02 12:13:00"}
