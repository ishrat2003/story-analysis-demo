With the positive outcome of the composite primary endpoint of the FIGARO-DKD trial, we have reached a significant milestone by completing the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date focusing on chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes across a broad range of disease severity,&rdquo; said Dr Christian Rommel, a member of the executive committee of Bayer's Pharmaceutical Division and head of R&amp;D, adding: \"We are pleased to see that the FIGARO-DKD data further support the evidence generated in the FIDELIO-DKD trial4 with respect to reducing the combined risk of cardiovascular death or non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The marketing authorization application (MAA) submitted to the European Medicines Agency, and the new drug application (NDA) accepted by US Food and Drug Administration for Priority Review were based on positive data from the previously completed Phase III FIDELIO-DKD study and are currently under review.</p>\n<p>The clinical data from FIGARO-DKD will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.</p>", "date": "2021-05-11 12:05:00", "meta_title": "Bayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finerenone meets primary goal in Phase III", "meta_keywords": "Bayer, Finerenone, Phase III, FIGARO-CKD, Kidney disease, Diabetics, Type 2", "meta_description": "Bayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finerenone meets primary goal in Phase III", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-11 12:03:55", "updated": "2021-05-11 12:11:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bayer-s-finerenone-meets-primary-goal-in-phase-iii", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "bayer_large.jpg", "image2id": "bayer_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Chronic kidney disease", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes, Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany", "company_tag": "Bayer", "drug_tag": "finerenone", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-11 12:05:00"}
