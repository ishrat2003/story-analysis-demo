RSV is the most common cause of LRTI and the leading cause of hospitalizations in all infants.</p>\n<p>Nirsevimab reached its primary endpoint, achieving a statistically-significant absolute reduction of LRTI caused by RSV in healthy preterm and term infants compared to placebo through a typical RSV season. No clinically-meaningful differences in safety results between the nirsevimab and placebo groups were seen. The overall safety profile of nirsevimab in the trial remains consistent with previously reported results.</p>\n<p>Results will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress&nbsp;and are anticipated to form the basis of regulatory submissions.</p>\n<p>Nirsevimab is a long-acting antibody, using UK pharma major AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) proprietary YTE technology, and being developed by AstraZeneca and French major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN), with the potential to provide immunity directly to infants and offer immediate protection against RSV. It is the first potential immunization to show protection against RSV in the general infant population in a Phase III trial. Nirsevimab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in the USA and PRIME designation in Europe.</p>\n<h2><strong>Competition in passive vaccination approach</strong></h2>\n<p>The Anglo-French partnership is not the only one pursuing the passive vaccination approach, with rival options under development from Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK), with MK-1654, as well as GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). USA-based vaccine specialist Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is also still in the running with its aluminum-adjuvanted RSV F vaccine ResVax, despite a Phase III setback.</p>\n<p>Dr William Muller, Associate Professor, Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Scientific Director, Clinical and Community Trials, Ann &amp; Robert H Lurie Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Chicago, Illinois, US and primary investigator of the MELODY Phase III trial, commented: &ldquo;Despite respiratory syncytial virus being the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in the first year of life, there is no routine preventative option currently approved for all infants. These exciting trial data demonstrate the potential for nirsevimab to change the prevention landscape not only by providing protection to a broad population of infants across the full respiratory syncytial virus season, but also by achieving this with a single dose.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nirsevimab is the first investigational extended half-life monoclonal antibody (MAb) aiming to protect all infants entering their first RSV season, when they are at highest risk for severe RSV disease. With nirsevimab, a protective antibody is administered directly to the infant with the goal of providing rapid protection.</p>\n<p>In contrast to other options for RSV under development, such as maternal vaccines, nirsevimab was designed to be administered at birth to infants born&nbsp;during&nbsp;the&nbsp;RSV season or at the season&rsquo;s&nbsp;start for infants born&nbsp;prior to the&nbsp;season.</p>\n<p>Nirsevimab is a long-acting antibody and is the first potential immunization to show protection against RSV in the general infant population in a Phase III trial.</p>\n<p>Mene Pangalos, executive vice president, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D at AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;These ground-breaking results mark a major scientific advancement in our effort to provide protection against respiratory syncytial virus for all infants. Nearly all children will contract the virus before age two, leading to nearly 30 million acute lower respiratory tract infections globally each year. Nirsevimab has the potential to provide a significant public health benefit as the first respiratory syncytial virus immunisation for the general infant population, and these data bring us one step closer to delivering nirsevimab to infants worldwide.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-26 10:56:00", "meta_title": "Nirsevimab shows positive protective profile in RSV", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Nirsevimab, Phase III, RSV, Respiratory, Syncytial virus", "meta_description": "Nirsevimab shows positive protective profile in RSV", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-26 10:55:00", "updated": "2021-04-26 11:02:25", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nirsevimab-shows-positive-protective-profile-in-rsv", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sanofi_big.jpg", "image2id": "sanofi_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": NaN, "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": NaN, "geography_tag": "France, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "nirsevimab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-26 10:56:00"}
