Of these, only 35 drugs are obtained from chemical ingredients manufactured in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Mr Semyonov, almost the same situation is observed in the majority of other countries, which are dependence on ingredients imports (primarily from China), estimated at about 90%.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Result of China&rsquo;s policy to reduce production capacities</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts believe the current situation is complicated by the fact that, since 2018, China has been pursuing a policy of gradual reduction of its production capacities in chemical sector, which is mainly due to their non-compliance with environmental standards and regulations.</p>\n<p>That has led to the closure of almost 1,000 factories in China that specialized in the production of chemical compounds for drugs, and resulted in the increase of prices for active ingredients and reduction of their range.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the case of Russia, currently the federal government, together with local producers, is consider the establishment of some new vertically-integrated production that will specialize both on the manufacture of active ingredients and drugs on their basis. For this purpose, there are plans to use chemical production facilities which already exist in Russia or to attract investors to establish their factories within the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Government will tighten control for quality of drugs in domestic market</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Russian government may tighten controls for the quality of drugs in the domestic market, according to recent statements by some senior Russian Ministry of Health officials and local media reports.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is in response to a recent report, prepared by Alexei Maschan, director of the Russian Institute of Hematology, Immunology and Cellular Technologies and some other local analysts about the influx of low-quality, untested drugs to the domestic market, which has been observed in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Mr Maschan, these drugs are usually cheaper than their legal analogues, which contributes to a high demand for them from local customers. One of the reasons for this is the traditional corruption in Russia during state examination of these drugs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During his speech at the expert council of State Duma, Mr Maschan cited the example of Vero-Asparaginase &ndash; a drug that is produced by the local firm Veropharm (part of US company Abbott [NYSE: ABT]) and which is intended for the treatment of pediatric oncology. Despite the fact that it resulted in strong criticism from doctors and the lack of its clinical trials, it was still allowed to enter the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr Maschan said this drug is a biosimilar, the quality and efficiency of which can only be verified in clinical studies based on research results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-08 15:54:00", "meta_title": "More efforts to reduce Russian pharma dependence on API imports", "meta_keywords": "Russia, Ingredients, Active, APIs, Dependence, Imports, Quality, Regulation", "meta_description": "More efforts to reduce Russian pharma dependence on API imports", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-08 15:52:16", "updated": "2021-03-08 16:04:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/more-efforts-to-reduce-russian-pharma-dependence-on-api-imports", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "russia_li.jpg", "image2id": "russia_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Production, Regulation, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-08 15:54:00"}
