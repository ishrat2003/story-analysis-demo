The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA will be set once the BLA is complete and formally accepted for review by the agency.</p>\n<p>Pfizer and BioNTech also have submitted an application to expand the current EUA for their COVID-19 vaccine to include individuals 12 to 15 years of age. The companies intend to submit a supplemental BLA to support licensure of the vaccine in this age group once the required data six months after the second vaccine dose are available.</p>\n<p>Last month, the companies also applied to the European Medicines agency to gain approval for Comirnaty use in children. And, earlier this month, Health Canada became the first regulator to approve the vaccine for adolescents.</p>\n<h2><strong>Others seeking pediatric use of their vaccines</strong></h2>\n<p>Meantime, Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) has been conducting a trial in children over 12 with its COVID-19 vaccine, while AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) has a UK-based pediatric trial of its option, Vaxzevria, but this is currently on hold due to in a few incidents of blood clots associated with the vaccine.</p>\n<p>Comirnaty (BNT162b2) has already generated record-breaking sales in the adult population, and is forecast to have peak sales of $24.8 billion for 2021. Along with its first-quarter 2021 results, Pfizer revealed that the vaccine recorded revenues of $3.5 billion for the three-month period.</p>\n<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is currently available in the USA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA on December 11, 2020. Since then, the companies have delivered more than 170 million doses of the vaccine across the USA. Submission of a BLA, which requires longer-term follow-up data for acceptance and approval, is the next step in the rigorous FDA review process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pfizer and BioNTech initiated the BLA by submitting the non-clinical and clinical data needed to support licensure of the COVID-19 vaccine for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. This includes <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious\">the most recent analyses</a> from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial, where the vaccine&rsquo;s efficacy and favorable safety profile were observed up to 6 months after the second dose. The companies will submit the required manufacturing and facility data for licensure in the coming weeks to complete the BLA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 15:48:00", "meta_title": "Pfizer and BioNTech initiate FDA rolling BLA submission for their COVI", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, BioNTech, FDA, Rolling submission, BLA, COVID-19, Vaccine, BNT162b2, Comirnaty", "meta_description": "Pfizer and BioNTech initiate FDA rolling BLA submission for their COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 15:46:12", "updated": "2021-05-07 16:05:07", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pfizer-and-biontech-initiate-fda-rolling-bla-submission-for-their-covid-19-vaccine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biontech_vaccine_large.jpg", "image2id": "biontech_vaccine_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "BioNTech, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "BNT162b2, Comirnaty, COVID-19", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 15:48:00"}
