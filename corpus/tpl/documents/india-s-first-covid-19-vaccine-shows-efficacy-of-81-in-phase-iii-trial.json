The trials involved 25,800 subjects, the largest ever conducted in India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today&rsquo;s results from our Phase III clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase I, II, and III trials involving around 27,000 participants. COVAXIN demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,&rdquo; said Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech.</p>\n<h2><strong>Already approved and distributed in India for emergency use</strong></h2>\n<p>COVAXIN is one of the tw<a id=\"publish\" class=\"publish\" title=\"Publish\"></a>Publisho Covid-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in India for its mega vaccination drive, which started on January 16, 2021 and is now in the next phase. The other one is Serum Institute of India's locally-made Oxford-AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) COVID 19 vaccine, Covishield.</p>\n<p>India has vaccinated more than 10.5 million healthcare and front-line workers since beginning its immunization campaign, noted a report by Aljazeera.</p>\n<p>But only 1.2 million, or about 11%, of them, have taken the locally developed COVAXIN, while the remaining 9.4 million have used the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the government&rsquo;s Co-Win online platform used to track the vaccination drive.</p>\n<p>BBV152 contains a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which is produced in Vero cells. It is stable at 2&deg;C to 8&deg;C (refrigerated) and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels. BBV152 has a 28-day open vial policy as a unique product characteristic, thus reducing vaccine wastage by approximately 10-30%. BBV152 is based on an established manufacturing platform with a better safety profile when compared to other vaccine platforms. The inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant enhances T-cell immune responses to COVID-19, leading to long-term protection.</p>", "date": "2021-03-03 17:21:00", "meta_title": "India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first COVID-19 vaccine shows efficacy of 81% in Phase III tria", "meta_keywords": "Bharat Biotec, COVAXIN, COVID-19 vaccine, Efficacy, Phase III", "meta_description": "India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first COVID-19 vaccine shows efficacy of 81% in Phase III trial", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-03 17:20:28", "updated": "2021-03-03 17:27:35", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-shows-efficacy-of-81-in-phase-iii-trial", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_big.jpg", "image2id": "covid_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "COVID-19 vaccines", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "India", "company_tag": "Bharat Biotech", "drug_tag": "Covaxin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-03 17:21:00"}
