The treatment is given as a single intravenous infusion and contains a replica of the missing gene SMN1.</p>\n<p>The NHS is currently identifying centers to provide the full-range services required to administer the therapy safely, with new specialist services treating patients in the coming months.</p>\n<p>These services require pediatric intensive care and a wide range of other clinical expertise such as neuromuscular, paediatric respiratory medicine, immunology, infectious diseases, hepatology, renal, cardiology and endocrinology.</p>\n<h2>SMA drugs coming of age</h2>\n<p>Sally-Anne Tsangarides, general manager at Novartis Gene Therapies in the UK, said: &ldquo;We thank the entire SMA community of families and clinicians for their efforts to help NICE and NHS England appreciate the unmet need in SMA. We are delighted for them that Zolgensma will soon become available to the families in England who need it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Breathing and feeding independently, and developmental milestone achievements like sitting and standing, which have been seen in infants treated with a one-time dose of Zolgensma in clinical studies, are unprecedented in the natural history of the disease.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The approval of Zolgensma makes it the second drug now available for youngsters with SMA in the UK, after Biogen&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BIIB) Spinraza (nusinersen) became available on the NHS to eligible patients in May 2019. Other treatments are also in development for the rare condition.</p>", "date": "2021-03-08 13:02:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Zolgensma, England, NICE, health, national, babies, young, children, treatment, deal, service, services, agreeing, bypasses, price, abeparvovec, spinal", "meta_description": "The National Health Service (NHS) has fast-tracked the introduction of Novartis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) to make it available for babies and young ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-08 12:52:18", "updated": "2021-03-08 13:35:09", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nhs-england-bypasses-nice-by-agreeing-deal-on-zolgensma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "2020_novartis_big.jpg", "image2id": "2020_novartis_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "National Health Service, NHS", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Genetics, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, UK", "company_tag": "Novartis", "drug_tag": "Zolgensma", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-08 13:02:00"}
