It will constitute more than half of the European market until 2024 and will be worth more than 840 million euros by the end of the forecast period. Imports of medical cannabis into the German market increased by 37% last year, bringing the total to 9.3 tonnes of product.</p>\n<p><img title=\"medical_cannabis.jpg\" src=\"/media/project_tpl/image/medical_cannabis.jpg\" alt=\"medical_cannabis.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>By 2025, countries like France and the UK will have developed patient access to medical cannabis considerably, and large European nations like these will represent a significant share of the European market, the report forecasts. If regulations continue to progress as predicted, the UK medical cannabis market could show the most significant growth of any country in Europe by 2025.</p>\n<p>As adult-use cannabis is not yet legalized anywhere in Europe, the market for legal cannabis products in Europe remains entirely medical. This balance is expected to shift over the next four years, as more countries open up to the prospect of legalizing adult-use cannabis.</p>\n<p>Prohibition Partners&rsquo; report identifies several European nations that could introduce legal access to adult-use cannabis by 2025, including the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany. Sales of adult-use cannabis could be worth over 500 million euros by 2025.</p>\n<p>This progression of medical and legalized adult-use cannabis will contribute to exponential growth over the next four years, hence the estimate that the European cannabis market will be worth 3.2 billion euros by 2025.</p>\n<p>Stephen Murphy, co-founder and chief executive of Prohibition Partners, said: &ldquo;Europe is beginning to realize its potential as the world's leading cannabis market. Since the first edition of The European Cannabis Report published four years ago, enormous progress has been made for patient access and cannabis education. We are only at the very start of our journey of cannabis in Europe but there is irrefutable momentum towards becoming the world's largest cannabis market, it is only a matter of time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Conor O&rsquo;Brien, a contributor to the report and analyst at Prohibition Partners, added: &ldquo;The European medical cannabis market is beginning to blossom. While competition is heating up for producers and suppliers of medical cannabis in Europe, many opportunities are still open for businesses to embed themselves in niches of the value chain, before the market becomes more established.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 15:56:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "cannabis, market, European, billion, euros, medical, report, Europe, growth, reach, legal, forecast, adult-use, worth, access, Prohibition, Partners, open", "meta_description": "The European cannabis market is forecast to grow with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67.4% to reach 3.2 billion euros ($3.75 billion) by 2025, a new re", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 14:55:25", "updated": "2021-03-31 15:57:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/europe-s-legal-cannabis-market-predicted-to-reach-high-of-3-2-billion-euros-by-2025", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cannabis-big.jpg", "image2id": "cannabis-sm.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia, CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Health Medical Pharma, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": "cannabis", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 15:56:00"}
