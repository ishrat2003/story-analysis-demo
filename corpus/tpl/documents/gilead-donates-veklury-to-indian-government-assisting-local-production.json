Our immediate focus is to help address the needs of patients in India who may benefit from remdesivir as quickly as we can by working together with the government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Licensees already scaling up their batch sizes</strong></h2>\n<p>All seven of Gilead&rsquo;s licensees based in India have significantly accelerated production of remdesivir by scaling up their batch sizes, adding new manufacturing facilities and/or onboarding local contract manufacturers across the country. While these efforts are expected to increase availability of remdesivir in the coming weeks, Gilead will donate at least 450,000 vials of Veklury to the government of India to help ease the immediate need for treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To safeguard against disruption of generic remdesivir supply to other low- and middle-income countries included as part of the voluntary licenses, Gilead is also committed to providing support to voluntary licensees based outside of India to increase their production capacity. Gilead&rsquo;s planned support will include the donation of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to licensees with a view to accelerate production.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-27 10:22:00", "meta_title": "Gilead donates Veklury to Indian government; assisting local productio", "meta_keywords": "Gilead Sciences, Donations, Veklury , Remdesivir, Indian government, Local production", "meta_description": "Gilead donates Veklury to Indian government; assisting local production", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-27 10:21:14", "updated": "2021-04-27 10:29:01", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gilead-donates-veklury-to-indian-government-assisting-local-production", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biotech_production_bottles_big.png", "image2id": "biotech_production_bottles_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Indian government", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Production, Public health", "geography_tag": "India, USA", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences", "drug_tag": "Remdesivir, Veklury", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-27 10:22:00"}
