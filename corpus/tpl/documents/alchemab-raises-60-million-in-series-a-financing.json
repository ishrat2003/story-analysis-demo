The company was created by SV Health Investors who led the Seed round in 2019.</p>\n<p>The proceeds will be used to advance Alchemab&rsquo;s unique target-agnostic drug discovery platform. The approach interrogates the entire antibody repertoires of individuals from well-defined groups who show unexpected resistance to disease despite genetic disposition or other risk factors predicative of a poor prognosis. Using insights gained, Alchemab can identify naturally protective antibodies with therapeutic potential. Alchemab&rsquo;s primary focus is the development of novel therapeutics for hard-to-treat neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, and the company currently has several programs at the pre-clinical stage.</p>\n<p>Alchemab&rsquo;s approach was developed with support from scientific founders at Oxford University, Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Hospital. Alchemab is amongst the first commercial group to access Illumina&rsquo;s Cambridge, UK Accelerator.</p>\n<h2><strong>Aims to be a major player in the identification of novel targets</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Our aim is to become a major player in the identification of novel targets and antibodies in the areas of neurodegeneration and cancer,&rdquo; noted Alex Leech, chief executive at Alchemab. &ldquo;The substantial financial commitment by this high-caliber group of US and European investors is a strong endorsement of our science and team,&rdquo;<em> he noted.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>His colleague and co-founder, Dr Jane Osbourn OBE, chief scientific officer at Alchemab, added: &ldquo;Our approach to understanding the natural immunological response to disease and why some people are able to stay well has huge potential to identify antibody therapies across a range of indications.
