Calliditas&rsquo; shares roared up 9.7% to 133.40 Swedish kronor in early afternoon trading following the announcement.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about being granted priority review, which reflects the unmet medical need of IgAN. We look forward to engaging with the agency and work towards an accelerated approval later this year so that we will be in a position to provide the first approved medication for IgAN patients,&rdquo; said chief executive Ren&eacute;e Aguiar-Lucander.</p>\n<p>Calliditas says it is the only company which has achieved positive data in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb and Phase III clinical trials in IgAN. If approved, Nefecon would become the first therapy specifically designed and approved for the treatment of IgAN, with the potential to be disease modifying. Subject to approval by the FDA, Calliditas intends to commercialize Nefecon for IgAN on its own in the USA.</p>\n<p>Around half of people with IgAN - up to 200,000 in the USA and Europe - are at risk of disease progression, which can lead to the highly burdensome treatments of dialysis and transplantation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Blockbuster sales forecast</strong></h2>\n<p>In this context, analysts have forecast that Nefecon, a patient-friendly oral treatment, could have global blockbuster potential, with peak sales in excess of $1 billion.</p>\n<p>As previously reported, Calliditas filed an NDA with the FDA on March 15, 2021. The NDA submission is based on positive data from Part A of the NefIgArd pivotal Phase 3 study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nefecon compared to placebo in 200 adult patients with IgAN.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Having a target action date provides us with a clear timeline as we continue to expand our US organization and prepare for commercialization in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to approval,&rdquo; said head of North America Commercial Andrew Udell.</p>\n<p>Calliditas has applied for accelerated approval, which allows drugs targeting serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. The surrogate endpoint in the pivotal Phase III trial NefIgArd was reduction of proteinuria versus placebo. The confirmatory Part B of the NefIgArd study, designed to provide data on long-term renal benefit, is fully recruited and is expected to read out in early 2023.</p>", "date": "2021-04-28 12:25:00", "meta_title": "FDA grants priority review for Nefecon, for patients with IgAN", "meta_keywords": "Calliditas Therapeutics, Nefecon, IgAN, Nephropathy, FDA, Priority, Review", "meta_description": "FDA grants priority review for Nefecon, for patients with IgAN", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-28 12:24:12", "updated": "2021-04-28 12:31:04", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-grants-priority-review-for-nefecon-for-patients-with-igan", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "calliditas_large.png", "image2id": "calliditas_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Inflammatory diseases, Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Sweden, USA", "company_tag": "Calliditas Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "Nefecon", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-28 12:25:00"}
