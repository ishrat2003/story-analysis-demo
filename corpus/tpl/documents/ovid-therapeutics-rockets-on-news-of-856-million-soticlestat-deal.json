Takeda will assume sole responsibility for further worldwide development and commercialization, and Ovid will no longer have any financial obligation to Takeda under the original collaboration agreement, including for milestone payments or any future development and commercialization costs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Deal offers $196 million upfront payment</strong></h2>\n<p>Ovid will receive an upfront payment of $196 million at closing and is eligible to receive up to an additional $660 million upon achieving development, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, Ovid will receive tiered royalties beginning in the low double-digits and up to 20 percent on sales of soticlestat, if approved and commercialized. The new agreement is expected to close by end of March 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.</p>\n<p>Under the 2017 collaboration agreement, Takeda received equity in Ovid and was eligible to receive up to $85 million in payments for regulatory milestones, including the initiation of Phase III clinical trials. Ovid led global development of soticlestat through the successful demonstration of proof-of-concept in multiple rare epilepsies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Soticlestat has emerged as an important late-stage molecule in our portfolio, which focuses predominantly on rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases with great unmet need,&rdquo; said Dr Sarah Sheikh, head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. &ldquo;We are working diligently and expediently to initiate and execute upon the Phase III studies in children and young adults with DS and LGS. Our goal is to one day bring new treatment options that provide greater seizure control, tolerability and function to DS and LGS patients around the world,&rdquo; she added.</p>", "date": "2021-03-03 17:41:00", "meta_title": "Ovid Therapeutics rockets on news of $856 million soticlestat deal", "meta_keywords": "Ovid Therapeutics, Takeda, Soticlestat, Global rights, Epilepsy, Dravet Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut", "meta_description": "Ovid Therapeutics rockets on news of $856 million soticlestat deal", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-03 17:40:51", "updated": "2021-03-03 17:54:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ovid-therapeutics-rockets-on-news-of-856-million-soticlestat-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ovid_big.png", "image2id": NaN, "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Ovid Therapeutics, Takeda", "drug_tag": "OV935, Soticlestat, TAK-935", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-03 17:41:00"}
