The overarching goal of the project is to make AEF0217 available to the Down syndrome community six to seven years from now.</p>\n<p>AEF0217 provides a new approach to treat cognitive deficits. It is a signaling specific inhibitor of the CB1 receptor (CB1-SSi), the primary receptor of the endocannabinoid system, responsible for the regulation of a large number of behavioral and cognitive processes. Recent studies have shown that cognitive disorders related to Down Syndrome involve hyperactivation of the CB1 receptor.</p>\n<p>CB1-SSi represents a new pharmacological class, discovered by Pier Vincenzo Piazza, AELIS FARMA&rsquo;s chief executive, during his tenure as director of the Neurocenter Magendie of INSERM in Bordeaux. These compounds selectively inhibit a pathological hyperactivation of the CB1 receptor without modifying its normal physiological activity.</p>\n<h2>'One of the most thorough evaluations of preclinical efficacy in Down syndrome'</h2>\n<p>AEF0217 has received one of the most thorough evaluations of pre-clinical efficacy in the field of Down syndrome. Using a recently validated translational approach, these studies have shown that AEF0217 completely reverses cognitive deficits in adult trisomic animals.</p>\n<p>Because of its unique mechanism of action and preclinical efficacy, AEF0217 has the potential to significantly improve the cognitive abilities of individuals with Down Syndrome, without producing significant side effects.</p>\n<p>Dr Piazza said: &ldquo;We are very proud to have been awarded this grant and very pleased by the outstanding positive evaluation it has received. After the Seal of Excellence received last year, the award of the ICOD project provides a full validation by the EC of the innovative therapeutic approach developed by AELIS FARMA.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Down syndrome, like many neuro-developmental disorders, is a real burden for the individuals and their families. At AELIS FARMA, we are very excited to try and contribute to alleviate this suffering by increasing the autonomy of subjects with Down syndrome and their social insertion.\"</p>", "date": "2021-04-09 16:32:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "syndrome, project, cognitive, AELIS, million, ICOD, disorders, development, FARMA, grant, treatment, deficits, receptor, euros, efficacy, approach, drug", "meta_description": "AELIS FARMA, a privately-held French biotech specializing in the treatment of brain disorders, has announced a boost for the Improving Cognition in Down Syndrom", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-09 16:24:42", "updated": "2021-04-09 16:57:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/down-syndrome-drug-development-given-six-million-euros-ec-grant", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "euro_euros_money_finance_big.jpg", "image2id": "euro_euros_money_finance_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "European Commission", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Business Financing, Research", "geography_tag": "France", "company_tag": "Aelis Farma", "drug_tag": "AEF0217", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": "Down syndrome", "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-09 16:32:00"}
