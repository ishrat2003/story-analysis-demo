CRISPR Therapeutics will continue to support the development of CTX001 and invest in further innovation to maximize its potential.</p>\n<h2><strong>Terms of the new accord include $900 million upfront</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the terms of the amended agreement, Vertex will lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CTX001 with support from CRISPR Therapeutics. Vertex will be responsible for 60% of program costs and will receive 60% of profits from future sales of CTX001 worldwide, representing a 10% increase in program economics compared to the previous agreement. CRISPR will be responsible for 40% of costs and will receive 40% of profits. Additionally, CRISPR will receive a $900 million upfront payment, with potential for a $200 million payment upon the first regulatory approval of CTX001.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cell and genetic therapies are key to our strategy of developing transformative therapies for serious diseases, and this agreement is an important next step in cementing our leadership in these modalities as we bring forward our broad gene and cell-based therapeutics portfolio. As we take the lead on CTX001, we want to acknowledge the foundational contributions by the team at CRISPR Therapeutics,&rdquo; said Dr Jeffrey Leiden, executive chairman of Vertex.</p>\n<p>He added: &ldquo;Our increased investment in our partnership with CRISPR is based on the compelling clinical profile of CTX001, which shows its potential to be a durable cure for patients with SCD and TDT, and the rapid progress that we and our partners at CRISPR have made toward registration and commercialization. We see a significant commercial opportunity for CTX001, and we believe we will be able to further enhance that opportunity by fully leveraging the breadth of Vertex&rsquo;s capabilities &ndash; including our established and proven R&amp;D and commercialization expertise in serious diseases &ndash; to bring CTX001 to more patients around the world, more quickly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Samarth Kulkarni, chief executive of CRISPR Therapeutics, noted: &ldquo;Given the transformative results and momentum that we have generated with this program, we are adopting a new operating model to enable a globally coordinated launch of CTX001, leveraging Vertex&rsquo;s best-in-class global capabilities and leadership in development, manufacturing, and commercialization to enable this medicine to reach all patients that can benefit from it as quickly as possible. We remain deeply committed to the Sickle Cell and Thalassemia patient communities and look forward to continued success in our partnership with Vertex.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-21 11:05:00", "meta_title": "Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics amend deal on CTX001 gene therapy", "meta_keywords": "Vertex, CRISPR Therapeutics, CTX001, Gene therapy, Collaboration, Sickle cell disease, Beta-thalassemia", "meta_description": "Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics amend deal on CTX001 gene therapy", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-21 11:04:17", "updated": "2021-04-23 14:11:45", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/vertex-and-crispr-therapeutics-amend-deal-on-ctx001-gene-therapy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "crispr-large.jpg", "image2id": "crispr-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "CRISPR Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "CTX001", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-21 11:05:00"}
