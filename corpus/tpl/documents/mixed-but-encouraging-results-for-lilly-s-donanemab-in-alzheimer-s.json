Further, prespecified exploratory analyses showed donanemab slowed the accumulation of tau across key brain regions in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Donanemab has &ldquo;potential to become a very important treatment&rdquo; in AD</strong></h2>\n<p>\"We are confident in the results of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study,\" said Dr Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, adding: \"This is the first late-stage study in Alzheimer's disease to meet its primary endpoint at the primary analysis. Donanemab has the potential to become a very important treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We were pleased to see not only slowing of cognitive and functional decline, but also very substantial clearance of amyloid plaques and slowing of spread of tau pathology. The constellation of clinical and biomarker results indicates the potential for long-term disease modification. We are grateful to the patients, caregivers, and investigators who participated in this landmark study.\"</p>\n<h2><strong>Longer and larger trials necessary</strong></h2>\n<p>In patients with early Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. However, longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, concluded the authors of the study in the NEJM, noting that it still failed to meet the pre-stated objective of showing a 50% reduction in trial participants&rsquo; cognitive decline.</p>\n<p>Specifically, at 76 weeks compared to baseline, treatment with donanemab slowed decline by 32% compared to placebo as measured by the iADRS, which was statistically significant. As early as nine months (36 weeks) after initiation of treatment, a significant difference in decline by iADRS was observed.</p>\n<p>In addition, 40% of participants treated with donanemab achieved amyloid negativity as early as six months after starting treatment and 68% achieved this target by 18 months. Donanemab is a monoclonal antibody that was designed to bind a specific form of post-translationally modified A&szlig;, N-terminal pyroglutamate, and thereby yield rapid and complete clearance of amyloid plaques.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"As a clinician and researcher, I'm particularly encouraged by the significant plaque lowering and the slowing of clinical decline with donanemab,\" said Dr Stephen Salloway, director of the Memory and Aging Program and the Department of Neurology at Butler Hospital and Martin M Zucker professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, quoted by Lilly. \"The donanemab results are a significant and encouraging milestone for people impacted by Alzheimer's disease and we are eager to continue on in this fight,\" he noted.</p>\n<p>Discussions with regulators on the development of donanemab are ongoing, according to Lilly.</p>", "date": "2021-03-15 10:30:00", "meta_title": "Mixed but encouraging results for Lilly's donanemab in Alzheimer's", "meta_keywords": "Eli Lilly, Donanemab.
