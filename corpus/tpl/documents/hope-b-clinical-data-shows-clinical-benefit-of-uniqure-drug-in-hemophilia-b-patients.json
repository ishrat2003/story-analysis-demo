These data were previously presented at a medical meeting late last year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The ASGCT presentation highlights these initial HOPE-B data that demonstrate the successful treatment with an AAV5 gene therapy of patients with pre-existing NAbs,&rdquo; stated Ricardo Dolmetsch, president of R&amp;D at uniQure. &ldquo;Patients in the trial who may not have been eligible for other gene therapies because of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies have achieved similar results with etranacogene dezaparvovec compared to those who did not have pre-existing NAbs. We believe this distinguishes etranacogene dezaparvovec as the only hemophilia gene therapy shown in a clinical trial to have the potential to treat nearly all patients, regardless of NAb levels in the generally prevalent range.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Follows FDA clinical hold in December</strong></h2>\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration placed a <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clinical-hold-on-uniqure-s-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-program\">clinical hold on uniQure&rsquo;s hemophilia B program</a> following the submission of a safety report in mid-December 2020 of a possibly related serious adverse event associated with a preliminary diagnosis of HCC in one patient in the HOPE-B trial. The hold was lifted last month.</p>\n<p>Patients in the Phase III HOPE-B clinical study were initially enrolled into a prospective, observational lead-in period of at least six months during which bleeding events and FIX replacement therapy usage were monitored. All patients required prophylactic routine FIX replacement prior to entering the clinical trial, and patients were not excluded from the trial based on pre-existing NAbs to AAV5.</p>\n<p>No clinically-significant correlation of pre-existing NAbs with FIX activity was observed up to a titer of 678, a range expected to include more than 95% of the general population. Mean FIX activity at 26 weeks was 32.7% in participants with NAbs versus 41.3% in those without. A single participant with a NAb titer of 3,212 did not respond and remained on prophylaxis; it is expected that less than 1% of the general population have a pre-existing NAb titer of more than 3,000. All other participants, both with and without NAbs, discontinued prophylaxis and remained prophylaxis-free at 26 weeks.</p>\n<p>Etranacogene dezaparvovec has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA access to Priority Medicine (PRIME) regulatory initiative by the European Medicines Agency. In June 2020, the company and CSL Behring entered into a licensing agreement providing the CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL) subsidiary with exclusive global rights to etranacogene dezaparvovec.</p>", "date": "2021-05-13 14:46:00", "meta_title": "HOPE-B clinical data shows clinical benefit of uniQure drug in hemophi", "meta_keywords": "uniQure, Etranacogene dezaparvovec, Phase III, HOPE-B, Hemophilia B", "meta_description": "HOPE-B clinical data shows clinical benefit of uniQure drug in hemophilia B patients", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-13 14:44:29", "updated": "2021-05-13 14:50:02", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/hope-b-clinical-data-shows-clinical-benefit-of-uniqure-drug-in-hemophilia-b-patients", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "uniqure-big-1.jpg", "image2id": "uniqure-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Netherlands", "company_tag": "uniQure", "drug_tag": "etranacogene dezaparvovec", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-13 14:46:00"}
