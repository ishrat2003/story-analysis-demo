An improved and maintained ability to feed orally was seen in 92% of patients, with 44% showing improved motor function, including the ability to sit without support. Reduced hospitalization was also seen, with 34% not requiring admission.</p>\n<p>The data were presented at the 2021 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Virtual Annual Meeting.</p>\n<p>Stuart Peltz, chief executive, PTC Therapeutics, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re encouraged to see these patients reach key motor and mobility milestones, which would never have been realized in the natural course of the disease.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The long-term data presented today build upon the robust pool of evidence supporting Evrysdi as a safe, effective and convenient at-home treatment option for SMA patients globally.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Roche (ROG: SIX) leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.
