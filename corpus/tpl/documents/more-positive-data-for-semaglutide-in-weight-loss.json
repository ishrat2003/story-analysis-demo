These changes, known as metabolic adaptation, result in lasting increased levels of hunger and desire to eat while reducing energy expenditure,&rdquo; said Dr Domenica Rubino, lead investigator of the STEP 4 trial and Director of Washington Center for Weight Management and Research. &ldquo;Like any other chronic disease, obesity requires a long-term, individualized approach to care, inclusive of medication and lifestyle components.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Following the 20-week run-in period, people who continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4mg for an additional 48 weeks continued to lose weight with a statistically -ignificant additional m<a id=\"save\" class=\"save\" title=\"Save\"></a>Saveean weight loss of 7.9% (8.8% for the trial product estimand) from week 20 to week 68. People who were switched to placebo following the 20-week run-in period regained 6.9% of their body weight from week 20 to 68 (6.5% for the trial product estimand. The estimated treatment difference [ETD] for the treatment policy estimand was -14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -16.0, -13.5; p&lt;0.0001). People who stayed on semaglutide 2.4 mg throughout the entire 68-week trial achieved a total weight loss of 17.4% (18.2% for the trial product estimand. Both treatment groups followed a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity programme throughout the study.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Obesity is a chronic disease that requires ongoing management and the results from STEP 4 trial strengthens the evidence around the potential of semaglutide 2.4mg to transform the medical management of obesity,&rdquo; said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, development at Novo Nordisk. &ldquo;Millions of people living with obesity are in need of additional treatment options to help them lose weight and keep it off. The results from STEP 4 show that to sustain weight loss it is important to maintain treatment and that semaglutide 2.4 mg has the potential to offer sustained weight loss of more than 17% after 68 weeks of treatment,&rdquo; he explained.</p>", "date": "2021-03-24 11:46:00", "meta_title": "More positive data for semaglutide in weight loss", "meta_keywords": "Novo Nordisk, Semaglutide, Phase IIIa, Weight loss, Obesity, ENDO 2021", "meta_description": "More positive data for semaglutide in weight loss", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-24 11:46:14", "updated": "2021-03-24 11:52:15", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/more-positive-data-for-semaglutide-in-weight-loss", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novo_nordisk_2021_flags_large.jpg", "image2id": "novo_nordisk_small_flags.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Metabolics, Nutritional disorders", "topic_tag": "Conferences, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Denmark", "company_tag": "Novo Nordisk", "drug_tag": "semaglutide", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-24 11:46:00"}
