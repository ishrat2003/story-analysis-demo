The company trumpeted a significant improvement in cognitive symptoms of the disease with ANVS401, and its stock leapt 127% to close at $60.</p>\n<p>The magnitude of the improvement was indeed impressive &ndash; but there are several reasons why the cautious investor might have held back. The results come from just 14 patients; do not specify the dose used; and concern just one of the trial&rsquo;s five functional endpoints. Worse, the placebo-adjusted benefit did not reach significance. With a $50m follow-on offering announced yesterday at $50 per share, some newcomers are at risk of getting burned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Annovis&rsquo; Phase IIa study aims to evaluate ANVS401, an inhibitor of amyloid precursor protein, tau and &alpha;-synuclein, in Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s patients. The trial&rsquo;s enrolment target is 68, but Annovis has been releasing data piecemeal. The day before the Alzheimer&rsquo;s data came out it reported biomarker data from 14 Parkinson&rsquo;s patients in the same study. In the 14 Alzheimer&rsquo;s subjects, a 4.4-point reduction in Adas-Cog11 was seen after 25 days of treatment with ANVS401. This reduction, of 30% from baseline, was statistically significant with a p value of 0.04, Ms Cairns noted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Annovis pointed out that this was substantially larger than reported by competitors. In the Emerge trial, Biogen&rsquo;s aducanumab managed an improvement of 1.4-points from baseline in Adas-Cog13 after a year, and in February Cassava reported a 1.6-point improvement in Adas-Cog11 after six months&rsquo; treatment with simufilam.</p>\n<p>Also commenting, analytics firm GlobalData notes that while the early, preliminary data generated so far are promising and there is an established unmet need for novel treatment approaches in this space, Annovis Bio still needs to address concerns around the drug&rsquo;s ability to provide therapeutic benefits in larger Phase III trials and the expected high cost of a first-in-class potential therapy, which will impact its future market entry. Given that, GlobalData anticipates that ANVS401 will generate sales of $161 million in 2027 in the USA, if approved.</p>\n<p>GlobalData neurology analyst Sarah Elsayed said: &ldquo;The role of neuroinflammation in PD has been increasingly explored over the past decade. In fact, a few companies have been investigating this approach to target PD patients at early stages of the disease, yet there are currently no available treatments that can offer neuroprotection or halt the disease progression. The announced data showed a highly statistically significant reduction in the levels of a number of different inflammatory biomarkers. As such, the advancement of ANVS401 into Phase III trials is a vital step towards providing further evidence to back up this hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData expressed that the &alpha;-synuclein pathway has been gaining increasing recognition among PD research, however, &alpha;-synuclein is mainly tested in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which adds a major difficulty in the process of collecting these samples during clinical trials.</p>\n<h2><strong>NGM craters after dropping mid-stage NASH candidate aldafermin</strong></h2>\n<p>Shares in NGM Biopharma have plummeted after the US biotech said it would <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ngm-bio-adds-to-woes-in-the-search-for-a-nash-treatment\">abandon development of aldafermin</a> in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), adding to a lengthening list of failed candidates for the fatty liver disease, commented Phil Taylor writing on Pharaphorum<strong>. </strong>It&rsquo;s not the end of the aldafermin story just yet however, as a Phase IIb trial in severe, stage four NASH is still ongoing and will run to its conclusion.</p>\n<p>Hopes aren&rsquo;t high however, and aldafermin follows in the footsteps of a string of other drugs that have failed in NASH trials, including drugs from Gilead Sciences, Genfit, Albireo, CymaBay, Cirius and others. Biopharma companies have piled into the NASH space in recent years, lured by the promise of big rewards for the first drugs to treat a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world and is becoming more common.</p>\n<p>One candidate that made it through trials &ndash; Intercept Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; FXR agonist obeticholic acid &ndash; failed at the regulatory stage when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug last year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These results are certainly disappointing, particularly given the dire unmet need in this patient population,&rdquo; said NGM&rsquo;s chief executive David Woodhouse. &ldquo;The lack of significant fibrosis improvement was unexpected given the consistency of histology findings previously seen with aldafermin in our adaptive four-cohort Phase II study,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Abivax&rsquo; ABX464 likely drug of choice in $18 billion IBD market</strong></h2>\n<p>According to Goetzpartners research analyst Dr Chris Redhead, first data from <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abivax-reports-excellent-efficacy-and-safety-of-abx464-in-phase-iib\">Abivax&rsquo; Phase IIb in ulcerative colitis</a> (UC) demonstrates statistically-significant improvement in the Modified Mayo Score (MMS) the primary endpoint. The 254-patient trial including 50% of patients refractive to existing biologic or JAK therapies showed ABX464 to be effective at all doses tested (25mg, 50mg, 100mg) with a rapid onset of action detectable at day 8. Although not powered, the trial also achieved statistical significance in almost all secondary endpoints, except clinical remission at the two higher doses. With little obvious dose dependence, management indicated pooling the different dose data yielded significance for all secondary endpoints.</p>\n<p>Adverse events were mild, dose-dependent and similar to placebo at the lowest 25mg dose. Data from the first 51 patients in maintenance study indicates that efficacy is sustained and increased after 12 months. These data confirm the previous Phase IIa data and open the door to a pivotal Phase III to start by YE2021E. ABX464's efficacy, safety and convenience would make the drug of choice in UC and perhaps the whole $18 billion inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) market; a strong basis for a transformative deal. Positive data from the ongoing Phase IIa study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) expected by end Q2/2021E would open the door to the rest of the $90 billion inflammatory disease market. Dr Redhead reiterates his OUTPERFORM recommendation and increases the target price to 54 euros.</p>\n<p>Potential drug of choice in IBD<strong> -</strong> If the sustained efficacy seen in the Phase IIa/IIb trials is repeated in pivotal trials, KOLs expect the drug would be used at every stage of disease from first line onwards. While it has yet to be trialled in Crohn's disease, most UC drugs are also effective in Crohn's. Given the safety and convenience, this would probably make the drug of choice in the $18bn and growing IBD market.</p>\n<p>Strong basis for partnering in 2021E: Funded through YE2021E, positive this positive Phase IIb data in UC alone should provide the base for a substantial partnering deal: only reinforced if accompanied by positive Phase IIa data in RA, he concluded.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Vectura marks a sorry outcome for UK biotech</strong></h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/in-brief/brief-vectura-rockets-on-news-of-958-million-takeover-bid\">Vectura&rsquo;s sale to the private equity company Carlyle Group</a> for &pound;958 million, UK investors have another reason to be down on biotech, opined Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage. Vectura, like Cenes and Vernalis before it, is the result of numerous UK biotech mergers that failed to amount to much.</p>\n<p>During its 24-year existence Vectura subsumed Innovata, Activaero and Skyepharma for a combined &pound;680 million, but shortly after building this respiratory disease focus it gave up on drug development to become a service company. Its sale price amounts to a 142% premium to its 2004 IPO. Cenes and Vernalis were sold for a pittance to Paion and Ligand respectively, and UK biotech&rsquo;s shining star is probably GW Pharmaceuticals, which had to seek fame and fortune in the USA.</p>\n<p>The UK still produces cutting-edge science, but the likes of Autolus, Achilles and Nightstar <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/interviews/interview-synconas-uncompromising-message-european-markets\">all chose Nasdaq to float</a>. The UK sector is left with a rump of micro caps, and even the once mighty Oxford Biomedica is now largely a services business, Mr Plieth concluded.</p>\n<p>Adding his voice, Phil Taylor on Pharmaphorum pointed out that the acquisition of one of the UK&rsquo;s biggest biotech companies comes as Vectura is in the midst of a business restructuring that has seen it pivot away from developing its own respiratory therapies and towards an outsourcing model in which it provides contract development and manufacturing services to other biopharma companies.</p>\n<p>Most recently, it partnered with UK start-up Inspira on a project to develop an inhaled therapy for COVID-19 based on a plant-derived compound shown to kill the SATS-CoV-2 virus in lab studies, with clinical trials due to start next year.</p>\n<p>Vectura&rsquo;s efforts to develop its own therapies met with mixed results, and the company was hit particularly hard in 2018 when it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pharmaphorum.com/news/vectura-takes-40-million-hit-as-asthma-drug-fails-trial/\" data-mil=\"80756\">abandoned</a>&nbsp;Phase III drug candidate VR475 for severe uncontrolled asthma, leading to a &pound;40 million hit on its finances.</p>\n<h2><strong>UK regulatory review of Alexion acquisition by AstraZeneca threatens GSK, says GlobalData</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uk-competition-watchdog-weighs-in-on-alexion-purchase\">UK regulatory review</a> of Alexion Pharmaceuticals acquisition by AstraZeneca limits the ability of GlaxoSmithKline to buy its way out of a proxy brawl with activist investor Elliott, says GlobalData, a data and analytics company.</p>\n<p>Despite the acquisition passing the regulatory review from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is now investigating it.</p>\n<p>GSK, the other major UK-headquartered pharmaceutical company, is heading towards a proxy fight with the activist Investor fund Elliot. Elliot has acquired a significant stake in GSK, while concerns about GSK&rsquo;s performance and the performance of chief executive, Emma Walmsley, have been growing.</p>\n<p>Peter Shapiro, senior director of drugs and business fundamentals at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Elliot will push to restructure the makeup of GSK&rsquo;s drug pipeline. The easiest way to restructure the clinical stage pipeline of a company is by the acquisition of smaller more innovative Bio/Pharma companies, which is what AstraZeneca is doing with Alexion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alexion has a strong pipeline of orphan and rare disease drugs that will diversify AstraZeneca&rsquo;s drug pipeline. If the UK CMA resists approving this acquisition, it could make it harder for GSK to acquire smaller more innovative Bio/Pharma companies as well. This is not the only problem for acquisitions, because of the high trading value of Bio/Pharma stocks currently, companies will have to pay a premium for acquisitions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Interestingly, Elliot is now involved with both large British pharmaceutical companies. In 2019, Alexion management came under pressure from shareholder Elliott to be acquired, which ultimately lead to the acquisition by AstraZeneca,&rdquo; Mr Shapiro noted.</p>", "date": "2021-05-30 11:41:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 28, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News reviews, Annovis Bio, ANSV401, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Aldafermin, Abivax, ABX464, Vectura, Carlyle, AstraZeneca, Alexion, Alzheimer's, NASH, Colitis", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 28, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-30 11:38:19", "updated": "2021-05-30 11:55:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-28-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Hepatology, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Drug Trial, Management, Research", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Abivax, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Annovis Bio, AstraZeneca, Carlyle Group, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Vectura", "drug_tag": "ABX464, aldafermin, ANVS401", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-30 11:41:00"}
