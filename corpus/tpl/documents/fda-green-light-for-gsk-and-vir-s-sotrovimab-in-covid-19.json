GSK was barely changed.</p>\n<p>The product is cleared for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.</p>\n<p>The European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s advisory committee CHMP earlier this month backed the use of sotrovimab for COVID-19 patients who were at risk of severe disease and do not need supplemental oxygen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Retains activity against all known variants of concern</strong></h2>\n<p>George Scangos, Vir&rsquo;s chief executive, said: &ldquo;Our distinctive scientific approach has led to a single monoclonal antibody that, based on an interim analysis, resulted in an 85% reduction in all-cause hospitalizations or death, and has demonstrated, in vitro, that it retains activity against all known variants of concern, including the emerging variant from India. I believe that sotrovimab is a critical new treatment option in the fight against the current pandemic and potentially for future coronavirus outbreaks, as well. At Vir, our aim is not only to deliver a clinically effective therapy for COVID-19, but also to provide effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and potential pandemics of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr Hal Barron, chief scientific officer and president of R&amp;D at GSK, added: &ldquo;The fast pace of COVID-19 vaccinations in the US is encouraging, yet, despite these aggressive efforts, there is still a need to help prevent infected patients from developing complications. In just over a year since starting our collaboration and in less than 10 months since beginning clinical trials, we are delighted that, as of today, the benefits of this unique monoclonal antibody will now be available to patients in need.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sotrovimab is continuing to be studied in ongoing clinical trials. An analysis of safety and efficacy data at day 29 for the full population from the COMET-ICE trial is expected as early as the first half of 2021. GSK and Vir plan to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA in the second half of 2021.</p>", "date": "2021-05-27 11:03:00", "meta_title": "FDA green light for GSK and Vir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sotrovimab in COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline, VIr Biotechnology, Sotrovimab, VIR-7831, Emergency use, EUA, FDA, COVID-19", "meta_description": "FDA green light for GSK and Vir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sotrovimab in COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-27 11:03:05", "updated": "2021-05-27 11:10:27", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-green-light-for-gsk-and-vir-s-sotrovimab-in-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vir-biotechnology-large.png", "image2id": "vir-biotechnology-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology", "drug_tag": "sotrovimab, VIR-7831", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-27 11:03:00"}
