The founding team is further complemented by Claus Schalper, a renowned finance expert and serial biotech entrepreneur.</p>\n<h2><strong>Progress around SHP2</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Anavo was founded to unlock the full potential of phosphatase-targeting allosteric modulators and has attracted one of the largest European biotech seed rounds to date. Recent progress especially around SHP2 [srchomology-2-domain-containing PTP 2] has demonstrated that the time is ripe to address phosphatase drug discovery more systematically and on a much larger scale,&rdquo; said Dr Zech, chief executive of Anavo Therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While more than 60 kinase inhibitors have been approved in the USA, there are no commercial drugs that target phosphatases. &ldquo;We are trying to change that,&rdquo; said Dr Zech.</p>\n<p>Dr M&uuml;ller, Anavo&rsquo;s chief scientific officer, noted that past attempts to target binding sites on phosphatases led to charged compounds that made poor drugs since they didn&rsquo;t get into cells easily and bound to their targets in unspecific ways. &ldquo;The entire industry dropped the field 20 years ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>", "date": "2021-04-22 12:04:00", "meta_title": "Anavo Therapeutics launches with 20 million euros seed financing", "meta_keywords": "Anavo Therapeutics, Established, Seed financing, Phosphate biology, SHP2", "meta_description": "Anavo Therapeutics launches with 20 million euros seed financing", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-22 12:03:33", "updated": "2021-04-22 12:10:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/anavo-therapeutics-launches-with-20-million-euros-seed-financing", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "anavo_big.jpg", "image2id": "anavo_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Netherlands", "company_tag": "Anavo Therapeutics", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-22 12:04:00"}
