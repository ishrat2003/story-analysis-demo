No indication was given as to the financial terms of the accord.</p>\n<p>The supply agreement with UNICEF for Sputnik V vaccine will broaden access to help meet vaccine demand around the world. Procurement and delivery of the vaccine by UNICEF is subject to the vaccine receiving World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The decision is expected soon on the Sputnik V application for WHO EUL that was submitted in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the RDIF will be holding a separate discussion with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to see the Sputnik V vaccine considered for inclusion in the COVAX Facility&rsquo;s Portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines. The COVAX Facility (co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO) together with UNICEF aims to\u00e2\u0080\u00afhelp end the\u00e2\u0080\u00afacute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair\u00e2\u0080\u00afand equitable access to safe and effective vaccines to all participating countries and territories regardless of income level, thus enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.</p>\n<p>RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev commented: &ldquo;RDIF is proud to support UNICEF and its partners&rsquo; global efforts to ensure equal and wide access to coronavirus vaccines for all countries. Vaccination is the best way to defeat the pandemic, help people feel safe, restore economies and return to normal life. Sputnik V is already used in more than 40 countries and this number keeps increasing as we continue deliveries to our partners every day. RDIF looks forward to the successful completion of the WHO prequalification process and obtaining EUL to start delivering supplies of Sputnik V through UNICEF to save millions of lives.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-27 16:13:00", "meta_title": "RDIF and UNICEF sign Sputnik V vaccine supply\u00e2\u0080\u00afdeal", "meta_keywords": "RDIF, UNICEF, Sputnik V vaccine, Supply\u00e2\u0080\u00afdeal", "meta_description": "RDIF and UNICEF sign Sputnik V vaccine supply\u00e2\u0080\u00afdeal", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-27 16:12:59", "updated": "2021-05-27 16:19:25", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rdif-and-unicef-sign-sputnik-v-vaccine-supply-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vaccine_sputnik_big.jpg", "image2id": "vaccine_sputnik_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On", "geography_tag": "Global, Russia", "company_tag": "RDIF, Unicef", "drug_tag": "Sputnik V", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-27 16:13:00"}
