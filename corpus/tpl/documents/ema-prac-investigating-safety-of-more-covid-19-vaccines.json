One case occurred in a clinical trial and three cases occurred during the vaccine rollout in the USA. One of them was fatal.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is currently only used in the USA, under an emergency use authorization. It was authorized in the European Union on March 11, 2021. The vaccine rollout has not started yet in any EU member state but is expected in the next few weeks. These reports point to a &lsquo;safety signal&rsquo;, but it is currently not clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and these conditions. The PRAC is investigating these cases and will decide whether regulatory action may be necessary, which usually consists of an update to the product information.</p>\n<h2>PRAC reviews signal of capillary leak syndrome with Vaxzevria</h2>\n<p>The PRAC has also started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of capillary leak syndrome in people who were vaccinated with Vaxzevria from UK pharma major AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN).</p>\n<p>Five cases of this very rare disorder, characterized by leakage of fluid from blood vessels causing tissue swelling and a drop in blood pressure, were reported in the EudraVigilance database.</p>\n<p>At this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination and the reports of capillary leak syndrome. These reports point to a &lsquo;safety signal&rsquo; - information on new or changed adverse events that may potentially be associated with a medicine and that warrants further investigation.</p>\n<p>The PRAC will evaluate all the available data to decide if a causal relationship is confirmed or not. In cases where a causal relationship is confirmed or considered likely, regulatory action is necessary in order to minimize the risk. This usually takes the form of an update of the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.</p>\n<p>The EMA will further communicate once the evaluations have concluded on both vaccines.</p>", "date": "2021-04-09 15:14:00", "meta_title": "EMA/PRAC investigating safety of more COVID-19 vaccines", "meta_keywords": "EMA, PRAC, Pharmacovigilance, Investigation, COVID-19, Vaccines, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Blood clots, Capillary leak", "meta_description": "EMA/PRAC investigating safety of more COVID-19 vaccines", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-09 15:11:42", "updated": "2021-04-09 15:25:28", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-prac-investigating-safety-of-more-covid-19-vaccines", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_big.jpg", "image2id": "covid_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "COVID-19 vaccines", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Public health, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": "European Medicines Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pharmacovigilance Risk Committee", "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-09 15:14:00"}
