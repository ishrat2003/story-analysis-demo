The Halix site is located in Leiden, the Netherlands, and will bring the total number of manufacturing sites licensed for the production of the active substance of the vaccine to four.</p>\n<h2><strong>New site and more flexible storage conditions for BioNTech/Pfizer&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>\n<p>A new site has also been approved for the production of Comirnaty, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The facility, which is in the German city of Marburg, will produce both active substance and the finished product. There are currently three active substance manufacturing sites supplying the EU included in the marketing authorization.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new manufacturing facility for this vaccine, the CHMP has also given a positive opinion to allow transportation and storage of vials of this vaccine at temperatures between -25 to -15\u00cb\u009aC (ie, the temperature of standard pharmaceutical freezers) for a one-off period of two weeks. This is an alternative to the long-term storage of the vials at a temperature between -90 to -60\u00cb\u009aC in special freezers. It is expected to facilitate the rapid roll-out and distribution of the vaccine in the EU by reducing the need for ultra-low temperature cold storage conditions throughout the supply chain.</p>\n<h2><strong>New manufacturing site and scaled-up for Moderna&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>\n<p>Already last week, the CHMP recommended approving the addition of a new manufacturing site for the production of active substance and finished product intermediates for Moderna&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine. The addition of the new manufacturing lines at the Lonza facility, located in Visp, Switzerland, together with other changes to the manufacturing processes that were greenlighted by the Committee are intended to scale-up production capacity and increase supply of the vaccine for the EU market.</p>\n<p>The changes described will be included in the publicly available information on these vaccines on EMA&rsquo;s website.</p>\n<p>The EMA is in continuous dialogue with the marketing authorization holders of COVID-19 vaccines as they seek to expand their production capacity for the supply of vaccines in the EU. As for any medicine in the EU, COVID-19 vaccines can only be manufactured in approved sites that are included in the marketing authorization following regulatory assessment.</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;ema_building-credit_rob_acket.</p>", "date": "2021-03-26 14:32:00", "meta_title": "EMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CHMP at last backs approving COVID-19 vaccines production plants", "meta_keywords": "EMA, CHMP, COVID-19, Manufacturing, Facilities, Recommendations, AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Pfizer, Comirnaty, Moderna", "meta_description": "EMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CHMP at last backs approving COVID-19 vaccines production plants", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-26 14:00:05", "updated": "2021-03-26 14:32:16", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-s-chmp-at-last-backs-approving-covid-19-vaccines-production-plants", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket.jpg", "image2id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "COVID-19 vaccines", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Production, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-26 14:32:00"}
