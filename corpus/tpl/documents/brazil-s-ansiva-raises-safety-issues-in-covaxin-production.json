According to the regulator, these issues could potentially risk the quality of the vaccine, and the action plan it sent was not sufficient to mitigate the risks.</p>\n<p>Covaxin is approved for emergency use in India for its mega vaccination drive, which started on January 16, 2021.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfillment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon,&rdquo; stated Bharat Biotech in response to the issue, quoted by The Indian Express. The company has an agreement to supply 20 million doses of Covaxin to the Brazilian government through Precisa Medicamentos, its partner in the country.</p>\n<p>Major issues flagged include safety-related observations that the company had not validated the method of analysis to prove complete inactivation of the virus (to prove that it was killed). According to the ANVISA, considering that Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine, the company needs to ensure that the virus was completely inactivated, otherwise live SARS-CoV-2 viruses may be present in the vaccine</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;coronavirus_credit_deposit_photos-</p>", "date": "2021-04-01 11:58:00", "meta_title": "Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ANSIVA raises safety issues in Covaxin production", "meta_keywords": "Bharat Biotech, Covaxin, COVID-19, Vaccine, ANSIVA, Safety issue", "meta_description": "Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ANSIVA raises safety issues in Covaxin production", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-01 11:57:25", "updated": "2021-04-01 12:05:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/brazil-s-ansiva-raises-safety-issues-in-covaxin-production", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "coronavirus_credit_deposit_photos-_largre.jpg", "image2id": "coronavirus_credit_deposit_photos_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "BBV152", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Production, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Brazil, India", "company_tag": "Bharat Biotech", "drug_tag": "Covaxin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-01 11:58:00"}
