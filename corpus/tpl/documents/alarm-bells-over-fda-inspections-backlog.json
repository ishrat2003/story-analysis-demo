{"contentid": 487998, "importid": NaN, "name": "Alarm bells over FDA inspections backlog", "introduction": "The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address a backlog in inspections that has been worsened by the pandemic.", "content": "<p>The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address a backlog in inspections that has been worsened by the pandemic.</p>\n<p>A halt on non-mission-critical foreign and domestic inspections led to the number of drug establishment inspections the agency carried out in 2020 dropping to less than half what it was in the previous two financial years, according to a GAO report.</p>\n<h2>'Inspections failed to keep up'</h2>\n<p>This report prompted Rosa Luisa DeLauro, the US Representative for Connecticut's third congressional district, to speak out in her position as chair of the House Appropriations Committee Chair and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.</p>\n<p>She told the subcommittee's oversight hearing on the FDA&rsquo;s foreign drug inspections program: &ldquo;When most Americans take a pill out of the medicine cabinet, they may not think twice about where the ingredients in it came from. But as foreign manufacturing of drugs has grown considerably in recent years, it is now estimated that around 80% of all drug ingredients come from foreign countries. Unfortunately, the FDA&rsquo;s foreign drug inspections program has failed to keep up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;GAO has studied FDA&rsquo;s oversight of the global pharmaceutical supply chain since 1998 and the results are not good. GAO has included the FDA on its high-risk series since 2009.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Notice period creates uncertainty</h2>\n<p>An issue raised by the subcommittee is that the FDA gives foreign drug manufacturers, but not American ones, 12 weeks advanced notice of inspections, allowing foreign manufacturers to potentially fabricate or shred data, use hidden laboratories, or secretly repeat tests before the FDA inspectors arrived.</p>\n<p>In unannounced inspections, investigators have found issues the plants were unable to hide such as important manufacturing records tossed in a trash bin, bird and insect infestations, even human urine puddled on the floor, creating a manufacturing area that is neither safe nor sterile.</p>\n<p>The result of these shoddy practices is that drugs with unapproved ingredients, toxic impurities, and dangerous particulates make their way into American medicine cabinets.</p>\n<p>Examples of damaging cases include hundreds of Americans dying from contaminated heparin, an anticoagulant drug manufactured overseas, in 2007 and 2008.</p>\n<p>Then, in 2018 and 2019, dozens of blood-pressure and anti-ulcer drugs were recalled because they contained more than 200 times the acceptable limit of a known carcinogen.</p>\n<h2>GAO report 'stunning'</h2>\n<p>Now the concern is that the pandemic has made the FDA&rsquo;s work to prevent potentially tainted drugs from entering the USA even more difficult.</p>\n<p>While the FDA has said that it could use other tools to serve as supplements to FDA inspections, the GAO fears that postponements could create a backlog of inspections of facilities that have never been inspected or that have not been inspected within five years.</p>\n<p>If postponements continue, it could both extend the maximum interval between FDA inspections beyond the agency&rsquo;s five-year policy and reduce the resources available in fiscal year 2022 for inspecting the other highest priority facilities.</p>\n<p>Ms DeLauro said: &ldquo;The GAO report was stunning. And that even so that the FDA uses alternative inspection tools to maintain some oversight of drug manufacturing quality while inspections are paused.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And the tools rely on inspections conducted by foreign regulators and requesting and reviewing records and other information and sampling and testing drugs, FDA has determined that inspections conducted by certain European regulators are equivalent to and can be substituted for an FDA inspection. That is wrong because other tools provide useful information but are not equivalent to what rate of inspection we deal with at the FDA. And we also know that the GAO reported from 2016 to 2018 both foreign and domestic inspections decrease.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-10 12:50:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "inspections, drug, foreign, backlog, drugs, FDAs, report, pandemic, manufacturing, bells, Alarm, years, address, Administration, Food, called, Office, tool", "meta_description": "The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address a backlog in inspections that has been worsened", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-10 12:40:37", "updated": "2021-03-10 13:47:40", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/alarm-bells-over-fda-inspections-backlog", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "fda_big.jpg", "image2id": "fda_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Production, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-10 12:50:00"}
