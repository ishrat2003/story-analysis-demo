With the Indian government seeking FDI specifically from companies intending to diversify manufacturing operations away from China, the $30 billion swell incorporates a tidy amount in the pharmaceutical sector, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s India correspondent.</p>\n<p>India's pharmaceutical sector has gained renewed global attention due to the crisis brought about by COVID-19, with the FDI inflows firmly establishing India's credentials as a safe and key investment destination in the world. Experts expect FDI flow to easily cross the $50 billion mark in 2021 given the government's focus, especially after COVID-19, to make India a manufacturing hub.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anti-China sentiment has also provided a bigger opportunity to attract fund flow. To encourage companies exiting China, the government intends to offer a red-carpet treatment, and is already working on simplifying entry process and ensuring ease of doing business in India.</p>\n<p>Currently, 100% FDI is permitted in the pharma sector. FDI up to 100% in greenfield pharma projects is permitted under the automatic route, and FDI up to 74% in brownfield pharma projects is permitted under the automatic route.</p>\n<p>Mergers and acquisition in Indian brownfield pharma continue to be an attractive proposition for foreign investors looking to enter India. With many global players deciding to move operations out of China, and India emerging a strong alternative contender, investment in the pharma sector is likely to gain further momentum, say experts.</p>\n<p>The government&rsquo;s concerted push through initiatives such as Make in India, National Digital Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat Scheme, etc, has cemented the overdrive.</p>\n<h2><strong>India attracts FDI</strong></h2>\n<p>The total market size of the Indian drug industry is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030, said Chemical and Fertilizer Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, noting that the Indian pharmaceutical industry has proven to be a dependable supplier of quality drugs at a time of global need on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>India has been serving more than 200 countries with its pharma products and will continue to discharge its responsibilities, he added. Stating that pharmaceuticals are one of the top-10 attractive sectors for foreign investment in India, Mr Gowda said FDI inflows in the pharmaceutical sector reached $499.73 million in 2019-20, recording a growth of 98% year-on-year.</p>\n<p>India's FDI system is the most liberal in the world, and the nation continued to draw direct investments even during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Niti Aayog chief executive Amitabh Kant, who went on to add that the automated route accounted for nearly 90% of the inflows.</p>\n<p>Despite invocation of offshore guarantees given by Indian companies, pressure from overseas lenders, and takeover attempts by deep pocketed foreigners amid plummeting stock and asset prices, India continues to attract FDI, he said.</p>\n<p>India's FDI saw a significant jump in November 2020. FDI data released by the Commerce Ministry shows that total FDI in the month of November 2020 grew by a whopping 81% to $10.15 billion against $5.6 billion in November 2019. FDI equity also jumped to $8.5 billion as against $2.8 billion in November 2019, registering a growth of 70%.</p>\n<p>India attracted total FDI inflow of $58.37 billion during April to November 2020, the highest ever for the first eight months of a financial year and 22% higher as compared to the first eight months of 2019-20 (at $47.67 billion).</p>\n<h2><strong>China upset with move</strong></h2>\n<p>In April 2020, India modified its FDI policy intending to prevent an 'opportunistic takeover' of companies affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The initiative upset China which has defined it as disobeying the international trade principal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new rules are primarily aimed at non-resident entities that are from countries that share a land border with India. This includes China and other nations such as Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, and Myanmar.</p>\n<p>Investor concerns over the global pandemic had caused stock and asset prices to plummet last year, sparking fears that some Indian companies could be vulnerable to pressures from overseas lenders and takeover attempts by deep-pocketed foreigners.</p>\n<p>To curtail any such attempt, the government made its prior approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share a land border with India.</p>\n<p>Upholding the move, in a recent written reply to India's Parliament, Minister Som Parkash said the changes made in the FDI norms last year are fully compliant with India's commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>\n<p>Mr Parkash said in the meetings of the Council for Trade in Services under WTO held in October and November last year, China had raised concern on the changes made in India's FDI policy.</p>\n<p>In early January 2021 too, China had raised concerns with the WTO over the harmful impact of India's FDI restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>India has asserted that FDI from all members of the WTO, including China, continues to be permitted. The change in rule was necessary in the light of investments by foreign companies amid weak markets and company valuations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, sources point out that the Indian government is further looking at easing restrictions for Chinese FDI by allowing companies from the bordering country to invest up to 25% in an Indian company through the automatic route. However, sources state this is being discussed only for non-sensitive sectors such as manufacturing, automobile, services, and technology.</p>\n<p>\"The government is deliberating on reverting FDI of certain percentage to the automatic route coming from land bordering nations including China. However, that could only be for sectors where 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route and pose no risk to national security,\" sources said.</p>\n<p>Meantime, India&rsquo;s pharmaceutical sector has been a major recipient of Chinese FDI. The Shanghai-based drug firm Fosun Pharma acquired a 74% majority stake in Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&amp;D firm Gland Pharma in 2017, at a valuation of $1.08 billion. The recent March quarter numbers of Gland Pharma shows 34% growth in consolidated net profit on robust sales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-19 10:47:00", "meta_title": "India set to attract FDI and exploit COVID-19 created opportunities", "meta_keywords": "India, Investment FDI, Opportunities, COVID-19, M&A", "meta_description": "India set to attract FDI and exploit COVID-19 created opportunities", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-19 09:04:18", "updated": "2021-05-19 10:47:31", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-set-to-attract-fdi-and-exploit-covid-19-created-opportunities", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "india_big_li-1.jpg", "image2id": "taj-mahal-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Indian government", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Financial, Focus On, Government Affairs, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "India", "company_tag": "FDI", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-19 10:47:00"}
