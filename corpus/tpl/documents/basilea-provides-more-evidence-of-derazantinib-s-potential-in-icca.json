The efficacy data obtained in the interim analysis met the pre-specified threshold so that the study will proceed to the next stage as planned.</p>\n<p>The interim analysis of cohort 2 is based on 14 evaluable patients who had at least one post-baseline tumor assessment. The pre-specified criterion that at least eight patients met the primary endpoint of obtaining progression-free survival (PFS) of at least three months was successfully achieved. The positive interim analysis allows the study to advance to its next stage and enrol a total of 43 patients. As a number of patients are still ongoing with treatment the median PFS was not yet mature at the time of the interim analysis and will be defined at a later time point.</p>\n<h2><strong>Candidate in-licensed from ArQule</strong></h2>\n<p>Basilea acquired <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/basilea-buys-rights-to-cancer-candidate-from-arqule\">rights to derazantinib</a> in 2018 from US biotech firm ArQule (Nasdaq: ARQL for an upfront payment of $10 million and up to $326 million in regulatory and commercial milestones).</p>\n<p>The disease control rate (DCR), reflecting the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease, was 79%, including one patient with a confirmed complete response, one patient with an unconfirmed partial response and nine patients with a best response of stable disease at the time when the interim analysis was conducted.</p>\n<p>According to analysts at goetzpartners securities, although still not fully mature, this data continues to support the case for the development of derazantinib in iCCA and in other fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) driven solid tumor indications such as urothelial carcinoma (UC) and gastric cancer where Basilea is currently investigating derazantinib as both a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr Marc Engelhardt, Chief Medical Officer, said: &ldquo;We are very pleased with the positive interim results for this cohort of iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene mutations or amplifications. The clinical benefit with derazantinib is similar to that reported for iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene fusions earlier this year. This supports the relevance of derazantinib in a group of patients with iCCA where there has been very limited clinical evidence of successful treatment with other FGFR inhibitors and confirms the broad potential of derazantinib as a monotherapy for the treatment of iCCA patients with diverse FGFR2 genetic aberrations. This outcome is very encouraging and further strengthens the evidence for the differentiation of derazantinib versus other FGFR inhibitors both from the efficacy and safety perspective. We are now progressing the study to the next stage and expect top-line results for cohort 2 in the first half of 2022.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-25 12:20:00", "meta_title": "Basilea provides more evidence of derazantinib's potential in iCCA", "meta_keywords": "Basilea Pharmaceutica, Derazantinib, Phase II, iCCA, Cholangiocarcinoma, Cancer, Bile duct, ArQule", "meta_description": "Basilea provides more evidence of derazantinib's potential in iCCA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 12:20:02", "updated": "2021-03-25 12:27:39", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/basilea-provides-more-evidence-of-derazantinib-s-potential-in-icca", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "basilea_large.png", "image2id": "basilea_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "ArQule, Basilea Pharmaceutica", "drug_tag": "derazantinib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-25 12:20:00"}
