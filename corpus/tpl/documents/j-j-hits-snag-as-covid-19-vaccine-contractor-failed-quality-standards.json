It said the issue \"was identified and addressed with Emergent,\" adding that it also informed the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n<p>The drug company said the problem involved one batch of a substance that goes into its coronavirus vaccine. It said the apparent mix-up happened at an Emergent site that is part of its manufacturing network but does not yet have FDA authorization to produce part of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<p>Emergent is not currently part of the coronavirus vaccine supply chain but was ramping up to be. This batch was part of the approval process, and would have been used if successful.</p>\n<p>The problem was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/johnson-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine.html\">first reported</a> by <em>The New York Times</em>, which said 15 million vaccine doses were potentially affected.

Following the review of initial data in this Phase IIa trial, the study will be expanded to a larger group of younger adolescents in a stepwise approach.</p>", "date": "2021-04-03 15:06:00", "meta_title": "J&J hits snag as COVID-19 vaccine contractor failed quality standards", "meta_keywords": "Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, COVID-19,  Vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions, Manufacture, Quality standards, Phase IIb, Adolescents", "meta_description": "J&J hits snag as COVID-19 vaccine contractor failed quality standards", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-03 15:05:17", "updated": "2021-04-03 15:15:37", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/j-j-hits-snag-as-covid-19-vaccine-contractor-failed-quality-standards", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "janssen_johnson_big.jpg", "image2id": "janssen_johnson_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Production, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Emergent BioSolutions, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-03 15:06:00"}
