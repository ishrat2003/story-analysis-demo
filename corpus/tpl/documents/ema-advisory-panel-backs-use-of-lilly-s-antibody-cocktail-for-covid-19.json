The opinion can now be considered by the EU member states when making decisions on the use of the therapies at a national level before a formal marketing authorization is issued.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sets scene for approval in low- and middle-income countries</strong></h2>\n<p>\"Today's CHMP recommendation is another important milestone in our efforts to extend access to antibody therapies for patients with COVID-19 around the world, providing a pathway for more EU countries to enable use of potentially life-saving treatments for COVID-19. In addition, other countries look to CHMP advice to support their own reviews. We hope this opinion will accelerate those reviews and authorizations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where Lilly is prepared to provide doses at greatly reduced costs or free of charge,\" said David Ricks, Lilly's chairman and chief executive.</p>\n<p>To support the opinion, the EMA reviewed Phase II and Phase III results from Lilly's BLAZE-1 trial. Results from BLAZE-1 demonstrated bamlanivimab alone reduced viral load and symptoms and&nbsp;also reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by approximately 70%, and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and death by 70% in non-hospitalized high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.</p>", "date": "2021-03-08 12:34:00", "meta_title": "EMA advisory panel backs use of Lilly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antibody cocktail for COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "Eli Lilly, Antibody cocktail, Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab,  COVID-19, EMA, CHMP", "meta_description": "EMA advisory panel backs use of Lilly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antibody cocktail for COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-08 12:33:13", "updated": "2021-03-08 12:43:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-advisory-panel-backs-use-of-lilly-s-antibody-cocktail-for-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eli_lilly_science_large.jpg", "image2id": "eli_lilly_science_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly", "drug_tag": "bamlanivimab, etesevimab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-08 12:34:00"}
