But he expressed concern over the potential price tag being impressive as well.</p>\n<p>\"That's why it's so important to provide a choice among multiple treatment options for patients with diverse needs, and to ensure that patients and the health system can afford these treatments,&rdquo; Dr Pearson said.</p>\n<p>\"We saw this opportunity squandered in the early years of PCSK9 inhibitors. The only way we get this right for patients moving forward is to price new treatments to their demonstrated clinical value, and link that to responsible insurance coverage criteria that are based on evidence and informed by input from clinical experts and patients.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"il\">ICER</span>'s report on these therapies was reviewed at the February public meeting of one of its&nbsp;three independent evidence appraisal committees.</p>\n<h2>'Patients deserve better'</h2>\n<p>The ICER's recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) for bempedoic acid/ezetimibe is approximately $1,600 to $2,600 per year, a range that would require a 36% to 60% discount off the treatment's current wholesale acquisition cost.</p>\n<p>While inclisiran's price is not yet known, the ICER's HBPB range for inclisiran for the broad population of likely eligible patients is between $3,600 to $6,000 per year.</p>\n<p>The HBPB is the top price range at which a health system can reward innovation and better health for patients without doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Dr Pearson added: \"Unfortunately, as the independent appraisal committee confirmed, current pricing for bempedoic acid is too high to get the ball rolling in the right direction. We'll have to wait to see what the price will be for inclisiran, but it would be a real loss for patients if at the outset of another round of new innovation, drugmakers set prices that send us right back into another grinding number of years in which access is limited while drugmakers and insurers wrestle over what is viewed as an unreasonable price. Patients deserve better.\"</p>", "date": "2021-03-02 16:46:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "patients, ICER, cholesterol, clinical, price, high, evidence, treating, therapies, report, treatment, bempedoic, health, inclisiran, drugs, priced, warns", "meta_description": "The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has released a Final Evidence Report on new therapies for treating high cholesterol.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-02 16:34:58", "updated": "2021-03-02 20:47:40", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-warns-of-real-loss-for-patients-of-unreasonably-priced-cholesterol-drugs", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "medicines_money_stock_large.jpg", "image2id": "medicines_money_stock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Steven Pearson", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Esperion Therapeutics, ICER, Novartis", "drug_tag": "Inclisiran, Nexletol, Nexlizet", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-02 16:46:00"}
