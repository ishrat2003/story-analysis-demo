Timing of the approval gives bluebird bio and Bristol Myers Squibb an around nine month lead versus competitors Johnson &amp; Johnson and Legend Biotech, commented SVB Leerink Research analyst Dr Mani Foroohar. The label includes black boxed warnings (mostly as expected). To mitigate safety concerns, Abecma is available through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) that requires administration at a certified healthcare facility. Leerink updates its model to reflect approval (increasing PoS to 100%).</p>\n<p>The process of production and administration of Abecma takes ~three weeks, and bluebird/Bristol Myers will split the manufacturing burden in the USA. bluebird is in the process of building out its manufacturing facility in Durham, NC, for lentiviral vector manufacturing in the USA and to support the rest of their pipeline. BMS will eventually assume responsibility for lentiviral vector manufacturing OUS; Dr Foroohar sees this as broadly in line with expectations around the split of obligations.<br /> <br /> Abecma will have a list price of $419,500 in the US and he estimates a net price of $375,000. After increasing our PoS of Abecma to 100%, Leerink models peak revenues of $629 million attributable to bluebird, as US economics are equally split between BLUE and BMY. BMY previously bought out ex-US milestone and royalty obligations for Abecma and bb21217 for an upfront payment of $200 million. As a result of these changes, our bluebird PT increases to $72 from $69/share.</p>\n<p>Also commenting, Amber Ton writing on EndPoint News noted that, once a closely-watched event, the approval of ide-cel in multiple myeloma received a relatively muted welcome when it was announced Friday afternoon. It was largely expected by analysts, who were however surprised by parts of the label.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were surprised by a few aspects of the label: Abecma was approved for 5L+, versus our expectation of 4L+, and HLH was included as a black box warning,&rdquo; Stifel analyst Benjamin Burnett wrote. &ldquo;However, after reflecting on these points with a KOL (tertiary care physician who leads CAR-T efforts at his institution), we think neither will significantly impact adoption,&rdquo; said Dr Foroohar.</p>\n<p>Biren Amin of Jefferies, meanwhile, noted that the approved dose range of 300-400 million cells was narrower than expected. He added that the approval bodes well for J&amp;J-partnered Legend Biotech, whose BCMA CAR-T, cilta-cel, has a PDUFA date lined up for this year.</p>\n<p>At least some investors were energized, bidding bluebird shares $BLUE up 8.27% to $32.46.</p>\n<h2><strong>AbbVie is a strong contender for migraine market following accepted NDA from FDA for atogepant</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the news on March 30 that the FDA has accepted AbbVie&rsquo;s new drug <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-abbvie-s-filing-for-atogepant-for-migraine-prevention\">application for atogepant</a> for the preventive treatment of migraine, Christine Wong, pharma analyst at analytics company GlobalData offered her views.</p>\n<p>She said: &ldquo;If approved, atogepant will be the first and only oral CGRP receptor antagonist specifically developed to reduce the mean number of migraine days for patients and will be launched as a preventative treatment. GlobalData anticipates good uptake for atogepant, forecasting annual global revenue of $766 million in 2026.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Atogepant is expected to face considerable competition from CGRP monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), most notably Amgen&rsquo;s erenumab, Eli Lilly&rsquo;s galcanezumab, Teva&rsquo;s fremanezumab, and Alder&rsquo;s eptinezumab. While these drugs address the need for effective prophylactic treatments, they are expected to be expensive, which may act as a barrier to uptake. Atogepant could have a competitive advantage, given that it can be administered orally, which may be preferred by patients and also be more cost-effective than the MAbs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AbbVie is strong contender in the migraine market given its production of treatment options including Botox (onabotulinumtoxin A), and Ubrelvy (ubrogepant). The potential approval of atogepant will allow the company to expand its migraine portfolio.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Amgen takes a swing at regenerative immunology with $721M acquisition of Rodeo </strong></h2>\n<p>With blockbuster immunology meds Enbrel and Otezla already in the fold, Amgen has mostly stood pat on infusing new blood into its legacy pipeline, noted Kyle Blankenship writing on EndPoints News. But that success won&rsquo;t last forever, and Amgen is taking a far-looking bet on a private biotech forging a new pathway to treat immune system diseases.</p>\n<p>Amgen will pay $55 million upfront and a devilish $666 million in future milestones to acquire Seattle-based <a href=\"/content/article/edit/id/~$n%2022%20news%206.docx\">Rodeo Therapeutics</a> and its small-molecule therapies targeting the 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) enzyme potentially implicated in a range of indications, the companies said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Rodeo uncloaked back in 2017 with a $5.9 million Series A and science from Case Western&rsquo;s Sanford Markowitz, Stanton Gerson from the National Center for Regenerative Medicine and Joseph Ready out of UT Southwestern. It was humble beginnings in terms of seed cash, but Rodeo&rsquo;s plans came with big-name backers, including AbbVie Ventures, Alexandria Venture Investments, ARCH Venture Partners, Eli Lilly, Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, Watson Fund, WRF Capital and WuXi AppTec, Mr Blankenship noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Notwithstanding J&amp;J, outlook for COVID control via &lsquo;vax&rsquo; increasingly positive</strong></h2>\n<p>In the past few days, important information has been disclosed about Pfizer and BioNTech&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/latest-pfizer-biontech-results-offer-youthful-optimism\">COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2</a> that makes the prospect of deep and sustained disease control through vaccination even more likely, according to SVB Leering Research analysts. First, the companies disclosed that their vaccine was 100% effective, and highly immunogenic, in adolescents. This is likely to be followed by an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for this age group within a matter of weeks (certainly by mid-year), which then means that many returning high school and college students will be vaccinated during the summer (assuming supply continues to ramp up) and the back-to-school season will be relatively &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The second important piece of news is the duration and depth of protection conferred by their vaccine in continued follow-up from their original Phase II/III pivotal trial cohort. The vaccine remains highly effective (90%+) out to six months with no apparent increase in breakthrough cases in the 12,000 subjects so far followed out to six months. There were no unusual, new or increasing adverse reactions to the vaccine reported with extended follow-up. Although the case numbers are small, the vaccine efficacy also appeared to be high (100%) against symptomatic disease caused by the South African (B.1.351) virus variant, which provides important reassurance about the ability of this vaccine to prevent and contain disease, regardless of the viral genotype.</p>\n<p>Although Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/j-j-hits-snag-as-covid-19-vaccine-contractor-failed-quality-standards\">lot release failure</a> (and the temporary hold on further production) is a disappointment, the analysts believe normal production (with increased quality controls) is likely to resume in a matter of days or weeks, and the supply of the mRNA products is accelerating rapidly.</p>\n<p>The resurgence in infection and hospitalization numbers in many parts of the USA is concerning, but not unexpected, given the ebullient reaction to the decline in cases in the past six weeks or so. The analysts expect these case numbers to accelerate in the coming days and weeks, and then for this to prompt an increased commitment and acceptance of vaccination, which should effectively choke off the virus&rsquo; supply of na&iuml;ve hosts by mid- to late-summer. They remain positive about an overall return to mostly normal social activity by the fall of 2020.</p>\n<p>For Pfizer and BioNTech, these events suggest to the analysts that the bullish guidance for doses and revenue supplied by BioNTech earlier this week can indeed be met, or exceeded, depending on the demand for BNT162b2 outside the USA in the second half of 2021.</p>\n<p>They still expect &ldquo;2nd generation&rdquo; COVID vaccines, containing the spike protein antigen from B.1.351 or a similar strain, to be introduced in mid- to late-summer, and to ultimately become the standard of care for boosting and priming schedules once supply transitions to the new sequence product.</p>", "date": "2021-04-04 11:33:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 2, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Bristol Myers, bluebird bio, Abecma, AbbVie, Atogepant, Amgen, Rodeo, 15-PGDH program, BioNTech, Pfizer, BNT162b2, Johnson & Johnson, COVID-19", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 2, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-04 11:31:07", "updated": "2021-04-04 13:41:07", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-2-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Migraine", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia, Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology, Infectious diseases, Neurological, Regenerative Medicine, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "AbbVie, Amgen, BioNTech, bluebird bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Rodeo Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "Abecma, atogepant, BNT162b2, COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-04 11:33:00"}
