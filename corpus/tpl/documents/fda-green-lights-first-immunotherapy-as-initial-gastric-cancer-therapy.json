The FDA&rsquo;s Oncology Center of Excellence director Dr Richard Pazdur, said Opdivo is the first treatment in more than a decade to show a survival benefit for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who are being treated for the first time, adding that there are roughly 28,000 new diagnoses of gastric cancer a year in the USA.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>Efficacy was evaluated in CHECKMATE-649 (NCT02872116), a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial that enrolled 1,581 patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, or esophageal adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) was determined centrally using the Agilent/Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test. Patients received nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy (n=789) or chemotherapy alone (n=792); study treatment was administered as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nivolumab 240mg with mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) every 2 weeks, or mFOLFOX6 every two weeks.</li>\n<li>Nivolumab 360 mg with CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) every three weeks, or CapeOX every three weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In CheckMate -649, Opdivo plus chemotherapy combination significantly improved survival for patients with metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, reducing the risk of death by 20%. Additionally, 55% of patients were still alive at one year,&rdquo; said Dr Yelena Janjigian, CheckMate -649 principal investigator and chief of gastrointestinal oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, adding: &ldquo;These findings are important, reinforcing the potential of this Opdivo -based combination as a standard of care for this population of patients in high need of treatment options that may extend their lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The application was reviewed under the FDA&rsquo;s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. The review was also conducted under the FDA&rsquo;s Project Orbis initiative, enabling concurrent review by the health authorities in Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Brazil.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, BMS announced that the European Medicines Agency <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bms-latest-opdivo-submission-validated-by-ema\">validated its Type II Variation</a> Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Opdivo in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (GC), gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Validation of the application confirms that the submission is complete and initiates the EMA&rsquo;s centralized review process.</p>", "date": "2021-04-17 14:19:00", "meta_title": "FDA green lights first immunotherapy as initial gastric cancer therapy", "meta_keywords": "Bristol Myers Squibb, Opdivo, FDA, Approval, First-line, Cancer, Gastric, Gastroesophageal", "meta_description": "FDA green lights first immunotherapy as initial gastric cancer therapy", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-17 14:18:01", "updated": "2021-04-17 14:25:21", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-green-lights-first-immunotherapy-as-initial-gastric-cancer-therapy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "opdivo__bristol-myers_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "opdivo_bristol-myers_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb", "drug_tag": "Opdivo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma", "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-17 14:19:00"}
