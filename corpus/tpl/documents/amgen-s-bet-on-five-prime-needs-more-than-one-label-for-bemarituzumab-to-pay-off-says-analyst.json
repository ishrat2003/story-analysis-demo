However, expansion in multiple FGFR-affected indications, such as bladder cancer, is where the most upside resides, with a forecast $305m peak sales globally by 2027,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Amgen is uniquely poised to take advantage of Five Prime&rsquo;s pre-clinical and early-stage clinical research, with significant experience in multiple mechanisms of action in oncology and taking first-in-class molecules to market. More likely, Amgen is considering several molecules from Five Prime&rsquo;s early-stage portfolio other than bemarituzumab, and with that information in mind, the premium paid to acquire Five Prime seems quite reasonable,&rdquo; Dr Palioras concluded.</p>", "date": "2021-04-19 10:11:00", "meta_title": "Amgen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bet on Five Prime needs more than one label for bemarituzumab", "meta_keywords": "Amgen, Five Prime Therapeutics, Bemarituzumab, Acquisition, Completed, Cancer, Gastric, Gastroesophageal", "meta_description": "Amgen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bet on Five Prime needs more than one label for bemarituzumab to pay off, says analyst", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-18 13:49:36", "updated": "2021-04-19 10:11:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-s-bet-on-five-prime-needs-more-than-one-label-for-bemarituzumab-to-pay-off-says-analyst", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "amgen_large.jpg", "image2id": "amgen_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Amgen, Five Prime Therapeutics, GlobalData", "drug_tag": "bemarituzumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-19 10:11:00"}
