Blood eosinophil counts and FeNO levels are two key inflammatory biomarkers used by clinicians to inform treatment options and were defined as blood eosinophil count (&ge;300 or &lt;300 cells per microlitre) and FeNO (&ge;25 or &lt;25 parts per billion).</p>\n<p>In patients with elevated baseline blood eosinophil counts (&ge;300 cells per microlitre)&nbsp;and FeNO levels (&ge;25 parts per billion), tezepelumab achieved a clinically meaningful 77% reduction in the AAER, compared to placebo.</p>\n<p>In a separate exploratory analysis of exacerbations requiring hospitalizations, tezepelumab showed an 85% reduction over 52 weeks compared to placebo when added to SoC.</p>\n<p>Tezepelumab also demonstrated statistically-significant improvements in key secondary endpoints compared to placebo in lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life. Improvements were observed in tezepelumab-treated patients as early as week two of treatment or the first time point assessment and were sustained throughout the treatment period.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>These results build on the NAVIGATOR data <a href=\"https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.astrazeneca.com%2Fmedia-centre%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2Ftezepelumab-is-the-first-biologic-to-consistently-and-significantly-reduce-exacerbations-in-broad-population-of-severe-asthma-patients.html/1/0102017964524a79-26b6ebdb-5342-4e6e-8ed9-eb71d859cc69-000000/dWRkTlqYQDgTqTtufxfUZBBJREo=214\">presented</a> in February 2021 which showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful reduction in the primary endpoint of AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population.
