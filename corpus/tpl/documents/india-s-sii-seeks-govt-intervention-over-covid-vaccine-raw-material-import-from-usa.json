The SII is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume.</p>\n<p><br /> <strong>US has invoked Defense Production Act</strong></p>\n<p><br /> In a letter to Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Prakash Singh, director, government and regulatory affairs at the SII said the US government has invoked the Defense Production Act, because of which the Indian firm is facing difficulties in importing cell culture medias, raw material, and some specialty chemicals from the USA.<br /> <br /> Mr Singh further said the SII is working on many other COVID-19 vaccine projects in technical collaboration with various companies, including the USA&rsquo;s Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) and Codagenix, for which it depends on the import of raw materials and components.<br /> <br /> The Institute&rsquo;s chief executive Adar Poonawalla has also gone on record admitting that restrictions on the exports of certain items in the USA was a &ldquo;serious limiting factor&rdquo; in scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines.<br /> <br /> At an online discussion, Mr Poonawalla said that, although the SII has been focussing on supplies of vaccine doses via the Gavi&rsquo;s COVAX facility, for free global access to vaccines it was necessary to get the raw materials out of the USA. He added that though the SII has stockpiled many doses, several constraints were present.</p>", "date": "2021-03-09 16:36:00", "meta_title": "India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SII seeks govt intervention over COVID vaccine raw material im", "meta_keywords": "Serum Institute of India, COVID-19, Vaccine, Production, Raw materials, AstraZeneca", "meta_description": "India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SII seeks govt intervention over COVID vaccine raw material import from USA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 16:30:39", "updated": "2021-03-09 16:43:45", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-s-sii-seeks-govt-intervention-over-covid-vaccine-raw-material-import-from-usa", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_big.jpg", "image2id": "covid_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Adar Poonawalla", "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Production", "geography_tag": "India, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Serum Institute of India", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-09 16:36:00"}
