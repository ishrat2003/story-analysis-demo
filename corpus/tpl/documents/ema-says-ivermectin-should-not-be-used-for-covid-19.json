Ivermectin is also authorised for veterinary use for a wide range of animal species for internal and external parasites.</p>\n<p>Ivermectin medicines are not authorized for use in COVID-19 in the EU, and the EMA has not received any application for such use.</p>\n<p>Following recent media reports and publications on the use of ivermectin, the EMA reviewed the latest published evidence from laboratory studies, observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses.</p>\n<h2><strong>Active at higher than approved concentrations</strong></h2>\n<p>Laboratory studies found that ivermectin could block replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), but at much higher ivermectin concentrations than those achieved with the currently authorized doses.</p>\n<p>Results from clinical studies were varied, with some studies showing no benefit and others reporting a potential benefit. Most studies the EMA reviewed were small and had additional limitations, including different dosing regimens and use of concomitant medications. The EMA therefore concluded that the currently available evidence is not sufficient to support the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 outside clinical trials.</p>", "date": "2021-03-22 14:22:00", "meta_title": "EMA says ivermectin should not be used for COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "Ivermectin, COVID-19, Prevention, Treatment, EMA", "meta_description": "EMA says ivermectin should not be used for COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-22 14:21:56", "updated": "2021-03-22 14:31:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-says-ivermectin-should-not-be-used-for-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ema-logo-large.jpg", "image2id": "ema_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics, Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": "Ivermectin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-22 14:22:00"}
