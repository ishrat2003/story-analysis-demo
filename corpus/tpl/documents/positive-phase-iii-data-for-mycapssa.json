In addition, Mycapssa met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin compared to long-acting iSRLs in maintenance of biochemical response.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The new encouraging data from all five late-breaking poster presentations further expand our understanding of oral octreotide capsules&rsquo; potential positive impact for patients with acromegaly who would otherwise need monthly, frequently burdensome SRLs injections,&rdquo; said Dr Maria Fleseriu, FACE, lead investigator of the MPOWERED study, Professor of Medicine and Neurological Surgery, Director of the Pituitary Center at Oregon Health and Science University&nbsp;in&nbsp;Portland, Oregon, and Immediate Past President of the&nbsp;Pituitary Society. &ldquo;As a practicing endocrinologist, I believe that these data provide valuable insights to physicians on the potential benefit of a twice daily oral drug versus long-acting injections for most patients,&rdquo; she noted.</p>\n<p>Raj Kannan, chief executive of Chiasma, added: &ldquo;We are pleased to characterize further the Mycapssa product profile with the positive results from Chiasma&rsquo;s MPOWERED study at ENDO 2021 for the medical community. This is the first head-to-head large, non-inferiority Phase III trial in acromegaly that has been done to assess safety and efficacy, including the effect on acromegaly symptoms, and on patient satisfaction. Based on these data, we remain focused on submitting a marketing authorization application for Mycapssa to the European Medicines Agency planned for mid-2021.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Others in the field</strong></h2>\n<p>Acromegaly, a chronic endocrine disorder characterized by hypersecretion of growth hormone, is almost always treated first with surgery.
