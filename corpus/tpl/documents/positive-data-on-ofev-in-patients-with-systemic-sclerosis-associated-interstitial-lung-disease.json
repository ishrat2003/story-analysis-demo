SENSCIS-ON is an open-label extension trial of the Phase III SENSCIS study to assess the long-term tolerability and safety of Ofev (nintedanib) in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). The study also evaluated the change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC), a measure of lung function, over 52 weeks.</p>\n<p>These findings, along with nearly 20 abstracts around interstitial lung diseases, were published online in conjunction with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2021 International Conference. The accepted abstracts are available at <a href=\"https://www.thoracic.org/\">https://www.thoracic.org/</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The depth and breadth of research findings from our interstitial lung disease program that we presented at this year&rsquo;s ATS builds on our company&rsquo;s legacy and commitment to respiratory medicine for the past 100 years,&rdquo; said Dr Craig Conoscenti, medical expert and chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease program lead, clinical development and medical affairs, at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p>\n<p>Ofev (nintedanib) was the company&rsquo;s second-strongest revenue contributor for the first time last year, with net sales of 2.06 billion euros ($2.5 billion) and growth of 41% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects).&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>SENSCIS-ON</strong></h2>\n<p>In an analysis of SENSCIS-ON, the safety profile of Ofev in participants who continued therapy for an additional 52 weeks was consistent with that observed during the SENSCIS trial. Approximately two-thirds of patients continuing Ofev either maintained stable FVC (~44%) or had an improvement in FVC (~20%) based on FVC changes from baseline to week 52.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The SENSCIS-ON trial provides important new evidence about the longer-term use of nintedanib in people living with SSc-ILD, showing a sustained reduction in lung function decline with a manageable safety profile,&rdquo; said Dr Kristin Highland, director of the Rheumatic Lung Disease Program at the Cleveland Clinic, and a lead author of the SENSCIS-ON study. &ldquo;These new data builds on the data already available on the use of nintedanib in SSc-ILD patients and should provide physicians with important information that will help them as they treat this serious, often life-threatening lung disease,&rdquo; he added.</p>", "date": "2021-05-14 15:52:00", "meta_title": "Positive data on Ofev in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated i", "meta_keywords": "Boehringer Ingelheim, Ofev, Long-term, Phase III, Lung disease, Interstitial, Sclerosis-associated, ATS Conference", "meta_description": "Positive data on Ofev in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-14 15:51:09", "updated": "2021-05-14 15:59:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-data-on-ofev-in-patients-with-systemic-sclerosis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "boehringer_headquarters_flags_large.jpg", "image2id": "boehringer_headquarters_flags_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Lung disorders", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany", "company_tag": "Boehringer Ingelheim", "drug_tag": "Ofev", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-14 15:52:00"}
