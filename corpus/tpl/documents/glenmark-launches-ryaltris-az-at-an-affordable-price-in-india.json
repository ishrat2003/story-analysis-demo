This will provide patients a far more convenient, cost effective treatment option in the country.</p>\n<p>Glenmark is the first company in the world to launch Ryaltris-AZ, as a novel fixed-dose combination of mometasone furoate 50mcg + azelastine 140mcg.</p>\n<p>The Indian firm has previously developed and marketed nasal spray Ryaltris (olopatadine and mometasone furoate), which is indicated for treatment of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).</p>\n<p>According to a study, around 20%-30% of the Indian population suffers from allergic rhinitis. Moreover, in India, patients have to bear the drug cost on their own and so the price of the drug becomes a major factor that impacts treatment adherence.</p>\n<p>While the average cost of therapy of top 10 existing brands of the similar drug category is 365 rupees ($4.93), Glenmark&rsquo;s Ryaltris-AZ nasal spray has been launched at a breakthrough price of 175 rupees per pack of 75 metered doses (MD). This cost is around 52% less as compared to the average price of the top 10 brands of the similar drug category in the market.</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 10:11:00", "meta_title": "Glenmark launches Ryaltris-AZ at an affordable price in India", "meta_keywords": "Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Ryaltris-AZ, Launch, Affordable, Price, Branded generic", "meta_description": "Glenmark launches Ryaltris-AZ at an affordable price in India", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-03 14:30:20", "updated": "2021-05-04 10:11:05", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/glenmark-launches-ryaltris-az-at-an-affordable-price-in-india", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "glenmark_big.jpg", "image2id": "glenmark_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Pricing, reimbursement and access, Product Launch", "geography_tag": "India", "company_tag": "Glenmark Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Ryaltris-AZ", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 10:11:00"}
