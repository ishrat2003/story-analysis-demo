It has also been shown to be 86.3% effective against the newer UK variant, which will help boost the vaccine roll-out in the UK once approved. Additionally, the vaccine is stable and can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, which allows for wider distribution,&rdquo; commented GlobalData analyst Keshalini Sabaratnam.</p>\n<h2><strong>Expects US and UK approval 2<sup>nd</sup>-qtr </strong></h2>\n<p>Novavax expects to receive UK and FDA approval in the second quarter of 2021 after recently reporting promising results from the final analysis of its Phase III UK trial. Although Novavax&rsquo; Phase III trial in the USA is still ongoing, the company expects that the FDA will allow it to use UK trial data to seek emergency use authorization.</p>\n<p>The results from NVX-CoV2373&rsquo;s Phase IIb trial conducted in South Africa have been less promising. The vaccine demonstrated an overall efficacy of 48.6% against predominantly variant strains circulating in the trial region. Nevertheless, across both the UK and South Africa trials, NVX-CoV2373 has demonstrated 100% protection against severe disease, including all hospitalization and death.</p>\n<p>Dr Sabaratnam concludes: &ldquo;If NVX-CoV2373 receives approval, it will contribute toward boosting the vaccine roll-out across multiple geographies in H2, which will help bring the pandemic under control.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-09 10:07:00", "meta_title": "Sales forecast for Novavax\u00e2\u0080\u0099 COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_keywords": "Novavax, COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-Cov2373, Sales, BioNTech, Pfizer, Comirnaty", "meta_description": "Sales forecast for Novavax\u00e2\u0080\u0099 COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-09 09:22:47", "updated": "2021-04-09 10:07:05", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sales-forecast-for-novavax-covid-19-vaccine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novavax_vaccine_large.jpg", "image2id": "novavax_vaccine_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "BioNTech, GlobalData, Novavax, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, NVX-CoV2373", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-09 10:07:00"}
