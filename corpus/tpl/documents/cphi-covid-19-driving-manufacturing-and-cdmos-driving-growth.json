The findings suggest that over the next five years, governments and companies will gradually look to reduce complexity and increase regional self-reliance.</p>\n<p>Highlighting this issue&rsquo;s current prominence, the implications of this shift are to be fully explored by a panel of experts during a live session (May 20 CPhI Discover). In particular, the merits of offshore versus onshore manufacturing, and/or if reshoring represents a rethinking of innovation approaches &ndash; with new manufacturing technologies introduced to improve efficiency. The recent launch of a new type of CDMO with &lsquo;powerful new technologies&rsquo; to meet post-pandemic vaccination needs is potentially an early indicator of the changing landscape.</p>\n<p>Overall, some 500+ executives in the survey were extremely bullish in their outlook for pharma manufacturing both in the medium and longer term. In fact, more than 60% of executives anticipate COVID-19 will &lsquo;greatly improve the business outlook in 2021 and beyond&rsquo; &ndash; driven by expanding global demand for the existing COVID treatments and upscaling. Consequently, the contract services industry is predicted to grow even faster to meet demand.</p>\n<h2><strong>Global reliance on Asian suppliers</strong></h2>\n<p>Another issue the pandemic magnified was the global reliance on sourcing starting materials from suppliers in Asia, where 80% of materials are sourced from. However, the market is broadly ambivalent, with almost half of the respondents now stating it is realistic to &lsquo;localize the manufacture of starting materials&rsquo;, verses more than a third that suggest that any potential mass move would be &lsquo;too disruptive to a complex industry&rsquo;, while a further 15% believe it would be &lsquo;desirable&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The industry is also seeing an expansion and modernization of finished dose manufacturing, with &lsquo;filling and packaging systems&rsquo; (24%) voted as the machinery type that pharma manufacturers will invest in the most in 2021. This is driven by drug product CMOs/CDMOs investing to become one-stop shops so they can aid innovators in simplifying and streamlining outsourcing, as well as the huge logistical challenge of filling billions of COVID-19 vaccines. Manufacturers are also expected to expand their capabilities and capacity for biologicals and capitalize on the impending wave of biologics approvals over the next few years, with large-scale bioreactors and fermenters (13%) expected to be popular in the upcoming year.</p>", "date": "2021-04-22 14:04:00", "meta_title": "CPhI: COVID-19 driving manufacturing and CDMOs driving growth", "meta_keywords": "CPhI: Survey, COVID-19, Pandemic, Manufacturing, CDMOs, Supply-chain, Self-reliance, Ingredients", "meta_description": "CPhI: COVID-19 driving manufacturing and CDMOs driving growth", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-22 14:03:28", "updated": "2021-04-22 14:11:12", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cphi-covid-19-driving-manufacturing-and-cdmos-driving-growth", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cphi_worldwide_big-1.jpg", "image2id": "cphi_worldwide_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Outsourcing, CRO and CMO, Production", "geography_tag": "Global", "company_tag": "CPhI", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-22 14:04:00"}
