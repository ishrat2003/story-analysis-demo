No serious safety signals were raised in the trial.", "content": "<p>The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance revealed last Friday that the Phase III Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) clinical trial sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), did not meet its endpoints. No serious safety signals were raised in the trial.</p>\n<p>Co-founded by Australia-based CSL Ltd&rsquo;s (ASX: CSL) CSL Behring unit and Japan&rsquo;s Takeda (TYO: 4502) in April 2020, the Alliance also included BioPharma Plasma, Biotest, GC Pharma, LFB, National Bioproducts Institute, Octapharma and Sanquin. Its aim was to help develop a potential plasma-derived therapy for people at risk for serious complications from COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The study aimed to determine whether an investigational anti-coronavirus hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-Ig) medicine (referred to by the Alliance as CoVIg-19) could reduce the risk of disease progression when added to standard of care treatment including remdesivir in hospitalized adult patients at risk for serious complications. Analyses remain ongoing and the NIAID and the INSIGHT Network intend to publish the full results of the trial soon.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Work now concluded</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the outcome of the ITAC trial, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance&rsquo;s work now concludes. The one-year collaboration involving organizations from across the world has strengthened relationships within and outside the industry, enabled a renewed perspective toward pragmatic regulation based on scientific evidence and need, and provided a well-defined, legally compliant framework for future collaborative opportunities to address urgent public health needs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While the results of this particular clinical trial are disappointing, we are proud that as an industry we proactively and collaboratively pursued this work, and that the program may contribute to a growing understanding of this challenging virus and strategies for patient care. Since we embarked on this development program, and throughout the pandemic, we have learned much from our scientific research. Importantly, we learned that as an industry we have the fortitude and capability to quickly work together for the greater good of human health,&rdquo; said Dr Bill Mezzanotte, executive vice president, head of R&amp;D and chief medical officer, CSL Behring and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Alliance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are especially proud that we pooled resources, brought our plasma expertise and infrastructure together at our own cost to benefit public health and added to our understanding of a complex field. We are extremely thankful to all those who collaborated day and night for one year in testing circumstances to develop and manufacture a potential solution for COVID-19, including those organizations from outside the industry who chose to support us,&rdquo; said Julie Kim, president of Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit, Takeda and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Alliance.</p>", "date": "2021-04-04 14:48:00", "meta_title": "CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immunoglobulin trial misses goals", "meta_keywords": "CoVIg-19, Plasma Alliance, Immunoglobulin, Phase III, CSL Ltd, Behring, Takeda", "meta_description": "CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immunoglobulin trial misses goals", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-04 14:47:36", "updated": "2021-04-04 14:59:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/covig-19-plasma-alliance-s-immunoglobulin-trial-misses-goals", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "coronavirus_structure_large.jpg", "image2id": "coronavirus_structure_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Australia, Japan", "company_tag": "CSL Behring, CSL Ltd, Takeda", "drug_tag": "CoVIg-19", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-04 14:48:00"}
