{"contentid": 488516, "importid": NaN, "name": "FDA approves treatment for chronic kidney disease", "introduction": "The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Farxiga (dapagliflozin) oral tablets to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression.", "content": "<p>The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Farxiga (dapagliflozin) oral tablets to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The FDA granted the approval of Farxiga to Anglo-Swedish pharma major AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN). Farxiga, which was originally approved in 2014 to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in addition to diet and exercise, is the first SGLT2 inhibitor proven to significantly prolong the survival of patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca beat Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s SGLT2 rival Jardiance (empagliflozin) in gaining approval for this indication, as the US/Germany pair are not expected to provide Jardiance data in the kidney disease setting until next year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Competition</strong></h2>\n<p>In the meantime, Farxiga, which generated sales of $1.96 billion in its current indications last year and $691 million in the first quarter of 2021, will compete with Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s own SGLT2 drug, Invokana (canagliflozin), which has approval in diabetic kidney disease, although not in kidney disease patients without diabetes.</p>\n<p>The co-chair of the DAPA-CKD trial and its executive committee, Prof Hiddo Heerspink, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, said: &ldquo;Based on the unprecedented results of the DAPA-CKD trial, dapagliflozin is now the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease regardless of diabetes status. This transformational milestone provides patients and physicians with a new and effective treatment option for this often debilitating and life-threatening disease.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mene Pangalos, executive vice president, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D at AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s approval is the most significant advancement in the treatment of chronic kidney disease in more than 20 years. We&rsquo;ve shown impressive efficacy for Farxiga in type-2 diabetes, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and, most recently, chronic kidney disease and we are thrilled to be able to bring this medicine to millions of patients in the US.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The efficacy of Farxiga to improve kidney outcomes and reduce cardiovascular death in patients with chronic kidney disease was evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind study. In this study, 4,304 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Farxiga or a placebo. The study compared the two groups for the number of patients whose disease progressed to a composite (or combined) endpoint that included at least a 50% reduction in kidney function, progression to kidney failure, or cardiovascular or kidney death.</p>\n<p>Results showed that 197 of the 2,152 patients who received Farxiga had at least one of the composite endpoint events compared to 312 of the 2,152 patients who received a placebo. The study also compared the two groups for the number of patients who were hospitalized for heart failure or died from cardiovascular disease. A total of 100 patients who received Farxiga were hospitalized or died compared to 138 patients who received a placebo.</p>", "date": "2021-05-01 14:47:00", "meta_title": "FDA approves treatment for chronic kidney disease", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Farxiga, Kidney disease, Chronic, Approval, FDA", "meta_description": "FDA approves treatment for chronic kidney disease", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-01 14:44:40", "updated": "2021-05-01 15:00:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-treatment-for-chronic-kidney-disease", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca_big-1.jpg", "image2id": "astrazeneca_small-2.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes, Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Farxiga", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-01 14:47:00"}
