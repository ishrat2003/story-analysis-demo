The partnership will involve a close collaboration between the two companies. Under the agreement, DotBio's Hong Kong subsidiary, DotBioHK, is responsible for generating multiple multi-valent and/or bi-specific stabilized and humanized single-domain antibody candidates for various targets using DotBio's proprietary DotBody technology.</p>\n<p>Uni-Bio is responsible for Chemical Manufacturing Control (CMC), Investigation New Drug (IND) submission, clinical trial and commercialization. &nbsp;DotBio will receive upfront and research payments, and is eligible for milestones and royalties, with the option to obtain additional stakes in these projects by participating in their later-stage development.</p>\n<h2><strong>Eye disease populations</strong></h2>\n<p>According to analysts Frost &amp; Sullivan, the patient populations of major eye diseases in China were much larger than those in the USA, whereas the size of China's ophthalmic drug market accounted for only one-fifth of that of the USA in 2019, indicating a strong growth potential of China's ophthalmic drug market. Among the four types of retinal diseases, prevalence of wet AMD increased more rapidly than the other three because of aging population.</p>\n<p>The majority of patients with wet AMD experience severe vision loss in the affected eye within approximately two years after diagnosis of the disease. The prevalence of wet AMD in China was 3.4 million in 2017 and is expected to reach 4.0 million in 2022 and 4.8 million in 2030. We believe that there is a significant commercial demand for the treatment of Wet AMD. As people are gaining awareness on the importance of eye examination, they can be given access to the life-changing, sight-saving therapies. The unmet needs in the AMD market are set to be addressed in the coming years.</p>\n<p>\"We are excited to collaborate with Uni-Bio to explore the potential of our DotBody technology in the ophthalmology space. Our stabilized and humanized VH domains, also known as \"DotBodies\", are a superior alternative to the camelid-derived VHH domains (nanobodies), by being generated synthetically without the use of animals, and being derived from human VH domain sequences present in normal monoclonal antibodies&hellip;We expect their use in a growing number of applications including ophthalmology because of these unique properties,\" said Dr Ignacio Asial, chief executive and founder of DotBio.</p>", "date": "2021-03-10 14:37:00", "meta_title": "Uni-Bio Science and DotBio partner on retinal diseases", "meta_keywords": "Uni-Bio Science, DotBio, Partnership, Retinal diseases, AMD, DME, RVO, mCNV", "meta_description": "Uni-Bio Science and DotBio partner on retinal diseases", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-10 14:35:30", "updated": "2021-03-10 14:45:21", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uni-bio-science-and-dotbio-partner-on-retinal-diseases", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eye-big.jpg", "image2id": "eye-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Ophthalmics", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "China, Hong Kong, Singapore", "company_tag": "DotBio, Uni-Bio Science", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-10 14:37:00"}
