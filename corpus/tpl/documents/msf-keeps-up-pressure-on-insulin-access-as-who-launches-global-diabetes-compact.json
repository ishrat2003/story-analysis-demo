We&rsquo;ve witnessed how multiple generic suppliers helped scale-up treatment for other diseases like HIV/AIDS, and now we need to see the same happen with insulin.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The entry of other insulin manufacturers would result in lower prices and a more stable supply of the drug, MSF argues. In 2019, the WHO launched its &lsquo;prequalification&rsquo; program to evaluate and help accelerate the quality approval of more human insulin sources beyond those from the three main manufacturers to enable countries and treatment providers to confidently procure more sources of quality-assured human insulin.</p>\n<p>However, to date, no alternative manufacturers have been quality-approved to produce human insulin. WHO must urgently prioritize and accelerate the prequalification of more insulin sources to break through some of the barriers that have kept insulin out of the hands of people who desperately need it, MSF has demanded.</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 12:47:00", "meta_title": "MSF keeps up pressure on insulin access as WHO launches Global Diabete", "meta_keywords": "insulin, global, diabetes, access, Compact, people, organization, disease, world, sources, pressure, launches, Health, care, bring, hopeful, prevent, human", "meta_description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) is hopeful that its Global Diabetes Compact will help to bring the right care to all who need it as well as boosting efforts", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 12:37:41", "updated": "2021-04-14 14:29:00", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/msf-keeps-up-pressure-on-insulin-access-as-who-launches-global-diabetes-compact", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "diabetes_general_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "diabetes_general_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Diabetes", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Public health", "geography_tag": "Canada", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, MSF, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, World Health Organisation", "drug_tag": "Insulin", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 12:47:00"}
