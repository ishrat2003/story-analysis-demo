Using a similar mode of action as ACM-001 (S-pindolol), the lead asset of Actimed, S-oxprenolol exhibits a multi-modal pharmacology that specifically targets the underlying pathophysiology of cachexia, and has demonstrated significant beneficial effects on survival, body mass and functional parameters in pre-clinical models of cancer cachexia.</p>\n<h2><strong>Financial terms<a id=\"publish\" class=\"publish\" title=\"Publish\"></a>Publish of the accord</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Actimed will receive an upfront of $550,000 in equity investment and cash and is also eligible to receive a near-term milestone of $2.7 million and up to $123.5 million in total potential milestone payments. Actimed is also eligible to receive royalties on any future sales of S-oxprenolol.</p>\n<p>Faraday gains global rights to develop and commercialize S-oxprenolol for cancer cachexia and any other indications outside of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Actimed retains global rights to S-oxprenolol in ALS, where loss of body mass and muscle wasting can impact survival.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am delighted with our agreement with Faraday for S-oxprenolol which is an important and mutually beneficial agreement for both companies,&rdquo; said Actimed chief executive Robin Bhattacherjee, adding: &ldquo;As well as providing a strong partner to continue the development of S-oxprenolol, this deal enhances our ability to speed up and further advance the development of our lead candidate ACM-001 (S-pindolol) towards Phase II clinical studies for cancer cachexia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. We are also pleased to retain rights to S-oxprenolol for ALS, an indication where patients suffer similar life-threatening muscle-wasting effects.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Faraday CEO Steve Hill commented: &ldquo;We are pleased to partner with Actimed on S-oxprenolol as we are committed to developing and advancing therapies that will prevent and treat cardiac and skeletal muscle loss associated with multiple morbidities. S-oxprenolol is highly complementary to our existing portfolio and will further strengthen our product pipeline.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 15:55:00", "meta_title": "Actimed out-licenses S-oxprenolol to Faraday Pharma", "meta_keywords": "Actimed Therapeutics, S-oxprenolol, Faraday Pharma, License, Cancer cachexia", "meta_description": "Actimed out-licenses S-oxprenolol to Faraday Pharma", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-13 15:54:19", "updated": "2021-04-13 16:04:46", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/actimed-out-licenses-s-oxprenolol-to-faraday-pharma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "handshake.jpg", "image2id": "handshake-small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Actimed Therapeutics, Faraday Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "S-oxprenolol", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 15:55:00"}
