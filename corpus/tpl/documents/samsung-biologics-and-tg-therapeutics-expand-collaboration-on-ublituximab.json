Ublituximab was also the subject of two successful Phase III trials in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) and a BLA is currently being prepared for this indication.</p>\n<h2><strong>Financial terms of the accord</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the rearrangement, Samsung Biologics will increase the production of TG-1101, raising its order receipts to 54.1 billion won ($48.5 million) from the initial 24.1 billion won.</p>\n<p>According to the contract, Samsung Biologics will receive a guaranteed 299.1 billion won if TG Therapeutics completes TG-1101 development, reported the Kora Biomedical Review. The payment can rise to 371.6 billion won when more companies request contracted manufacturing service of TG Therapeutics&rsquo; hematologic cancer therapy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are very glad to be able to flexibly accommodate our client&rsquo;s expanded needs through our facilities,&rdquo; commented John Rim, chief executive of Samsung Biologics, adding: &ldquo;By supporting TG Therapeutics in this partnership, we are contributing to bringing needed treatments to patients around the world, and getting a step closer to our vision of bringing about a better life for humanity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Michael Weiss, executive chairman and CEO of TG Therapeutics, stated: &ldquo;Samsung is the global leader in biologics manufacturing and we are happy to have them as our partner as we look forward to the potential commercialization of ublituximab across both oncology and autoimmune indications. With the recent positive ULTIMATE I and II MS Phase III studies, we re-evaluated our supply needs and were very pleased we were able to secure the long-term capacity we believe we will need to meet the potential global demand for ublituximab. This is an important next step in our [long-standing] relationship with Samsung.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Building fourth facility</strong></h2>\n<p>In order to support all its current and potential clients around the world, Samsung Biologics is currently building its fourth and largest biomanufacturing facility in Incheon, Korea. Upon completion of the said plant in 2023, Samsung Biologics will hold 620,000 liters of biomanufacturing capacity, or approximately a quarter of the entire bio-CMO capacity globally. The company provides contract manufacturing, contract development, and testing services all from a single location, offering end-to-end services for its clients.</p>", "date": "2021-04-27 10:09:00", "meta_title": "Samsung Biologics and TG Therapeutics expand collaboration on ublituxi", "meta_keywords": "Samsung Biologics, TG Therapeutics, Collaboration, Production, Ublituximab", "meta_description": "Samsung Biologics and TG Therapeutics expand collaboration on ublituximab", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-27 09:49:00", "updated": "2021-04-27 10:09:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/samsung-biologics-and-tg-therapeutics-expand-collaboration-on-ublituximab", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tg-therapeutics-large.jpg", "image2id": "tg-therapeutics-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Outsourcing, CRO and CMO, Production", "geography_tag": "South Korea, USA", "company_tag": "Samsung BioLogics, TG Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "ublituximab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-27 10:09:00"}
