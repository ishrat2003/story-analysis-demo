It is seen as a global public health problem that could lead to 10 million deaths over the next 25 years and cause economic losses of more than $100 trillion by 2050.</p>\n<p>The PAHO has further pointed out that AMR is making it harder to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n<p>Gina Tambini, the PAHO/WHO Colombia representative, said: &ldquo;This is a great global challenge and hence the importance of working together; because this is a cross-border problem that affects human health, animal and environmental health. Knowledge and training in the proper use of antibiotics has never been more important than now.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Education and appropriate prescribing</h2>\n<p>AMR is an issue that concerns the pharmaceutical industry and requires action on different fronts, according to Alvaro Orlando Sarmiento Castro, scientific director of the Association of Pharmaceutical Research and Development Laboratories (AFIDRO).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The first objective is to educate and promote preventive measures, to avoid bacterial infections as much as possible. If we avoid infections, we avoid the need to use antibiotics and consequently the possibility of developing AMR.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A second tranche of work is directed by different pharmaceutical companies, which market their products with the clear and explicit recommendation that they should be supplied to patients by strict prescription, issued by an officially authorized prescriber; in accordance with local legislation and with the same warning, they are authorized by the health authority &ndash; in the case of Colombia, this is INVIMA (National Institute of Drug and Food Surveillance).&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some companies help with education around AMR, focusing on its importance and how to combat it. For example, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has run the Small Actions Will Save Millions of Lives campaign in Colombia to encourage and raise awareness about the correct use of antibiotics.</p>\n<p>Similarly, AFIDRO laboratories provide prescribers with messages about the importance of using antibiotics in the indicated bacterial infection, at the indicated doses and with the prescribed duration of treatment, and invite them to report any resistance to this that they detect in their patients.</p>\n<p>Finally, the pharmaceutical industry in Colombia, together with other entities, participates in programs for the proper final disposal of pharmaceutical products or their remnants, in such a way as to avoid reuse, dispensing, improper use or contamination of water sources.</p>\n<h2>What about new antibiotics?</h2>\n<p>Effective new antibiotics are needed to prevent medical procedures such as organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy, diabetes control and major surgery such as caesarean sections or hip replacements, from becoming very risky. Infections such as pneumonia, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are increasingly difficult to treat due to AMR and a lack of new antibiotics.</p>\n<p>One of the issues of concern to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the face of AMR, is the reduction in private investment and the lack of innovation in the development of new antibiotics. The WHO states that, &ldquo;of the 60 drugs in development (50 antibiotics and 10 biological), few are specifically designed to fight the most threatening resistant bacteria (gram-negative bacteria).&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Dr Orlando Sarmiento Castro stressed that the pharmaceutical industry does accept its responsibility and maintain ongoing interest in seeking therapeutic solutions for diseases that concern humanity, and it does not cease investigating new molecules to attack the different bacteria that generate resistance.</p>\n<p>He added that today&rsquo;s research faces the challenge of identifying and understanding the resistance mechanisms that bacteria have developed in order to create new therapeutic options that can overcome these barriers and help infected patients.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Shutterstock</a></p>", "date": "2021-04-22 13:43:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": "Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay are the seven Latin American countries selected to receive support from the European Union (EU) t", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-22 11:14:45", "updated": "2021-04-22 13:43:19", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/latin-american-countries-fight-antimicrobial-resistance", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "latin_america_shutterstock_large.jpg", "image2id": "latin_america_shutterstock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics, Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "From our correspondent, Health Medical Pharma, Healthcare, In Depth, Public health", "geography_tag": "Central America, Colombia, South America", "company_tag": "Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos INVIMA, Pfizer", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-22 13:43:00"}
