These include treatments for HIV, diabetes and arthritis.</p>\n<p>Bedaquiline, the backbone of drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment that is sold by Janssen under the brand name Sirturo, will be under monopoly in Brazil until 2028, while in other countries the patent will expire in 2023.</p>\n<h2>Important precedent internationally</h2>\n<p>Felipe de Carvalho, MSF's access campaign coordinator in Brazil, said: &ldquo;The current provision of extending patent terms threatens the sustainability of the universal healthcare system that so many Brazilians rely upon to stay healthy and alive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By rendering this provision unconstitutional, the Supreme Court would not only ensure access to medicines needed now for many life-threatening illnesses, but would also safeguard access to potential treatments that will be needed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. We truly hope our judicial system will take the right step in prioritizing people&rsquo;s health over corporate financial interests.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The decision could also set a positive precedent for many other countries presently undergoing patent law reformation, such as South Africa.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many of us around the world are anxiously waiting for this crucial decision from the Brazilian Supreme Court,&rdquo; said Kate Stegeman, MSF's access campaign advocacy coordinator in South Africa.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As the South African government has yet to finalize essential and overdue draft amendments to our Patents Act that presently lacks adequate public health safeguards, this decision in Brazil could serve as a strong impetus for many of us also calling for patent law reforms. Removal of this harmful measure will be a major victory for people&rsquo;s access to affordable medicines in South Africa and around the world.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-06 17:25:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "patent, provision, Brazil, years, access, patents, Supreme, Court, decision, term, extensions, allowing, prices, Brazilian, medicines, national, amending", "meta_description": "The Brazilian Supreme Court of Justice is expected to deliver a potentially groundbreaking verdict on the constitutionality of a provision in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inte", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-06 17:11:25", "updated": "2021-04-06 17:58:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/crucial-brazil-decision-due-on-amending-national-patent-law", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "brazil-big.jpg", "image2id": "brazil-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Focus On, Legal, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Brazil, South Africa", "company_tag": "Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, MSF", "drug_tag": "bedaquiline, Sirturo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-06 17:25:00"}
