However, in August last year, Boehringer decided not to exercise its option on the Kv3 program. Autifony was formed in 2011 as a spin-out from GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK).</p>\n<p>Under the new agreement, Autifony and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s Research Beyond Borders team will investigate a novel ion channel target involved in the function of cellular lysosomes. The new program aims to discover and develop first-in-class modulators of these channels which have the potential to treat a range of indications, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and other disorders linked to lysosomal dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Financial details are not disclosed, but will include research funding as well as success-related milestones and other downstream payments.</p>\n<p>Dr Charles Large, chief executive of Autifony, commented: &ldquo;In initiating this collaboration, Boehringer Ingelheim has demonstrated the continuing value the company places on Autifony&rsquo;s skills and expertise in ion channel drug discovery and development. We look forward to working again with Boehringer Ingelheim on an exciting novel target and to discovering ground-breaking treatments for patients in areas of serious unmet need.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-04 10:09:00", "meta_title": "Boehringer renews collaboration with Autifony", "meta_keywords": "Autifony Therapeutics, Boehriger Ingelheim, Collaboration, Parkinson's disease, Lyposomal dysfunction", "meta_description": "Boehringer renews collaboration with Autifony", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-04 10:01:38", "updated": "2021-03-04 10:09:55", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/boehringer-renews-collaboration-with-autifony", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "autifony-big.png", "image2id": "autifony-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Germany, UK", "company_tag": "Autifony Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-04 10:09:00"}
