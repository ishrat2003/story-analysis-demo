In the trial, Tagrisso demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the primary analysis population of patients with Stage II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC. The ADAURA trial also showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in DFS in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease, a key secondary endpoint.</p>\n<h2><strong>Current approvals in China</strong></h2>\n<p>In September 2019, the NMPA) granted marketing authorization for Tagrisso as a first-line treatment for adults with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have the genetic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitutions. The drug was approved in China in March 2017 and added to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) effective from January 2019 for the 2nd-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC.</p>\n<p>While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have surgery with curative intent, recurrence is still common in early-stage disease. Historically, nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, have experienced recurrence within five years. More than a third of the world&rsquo;s lung cancer patients are in China and among those with NSCLC, around 40% have tumors with an EGFR mutation.</p>\n<p>Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, Oncology Business Unit, said: &ldquo;The expedited approval of Tagrisso in China as part of a curative-intent regimen for early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer underscores the high unmet need in this setting and our commitment to improving outcomes in a country with one of the highest rates of EGFR mutations in the world. This approval reinforces the importance of EGFR testing across all stages of lung cancer, prior to treatment decisions, to ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from targeted therapies like Tagrisso and live cancer-free longer.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 14:13:00", "meta_title": "China nod for Tagrisso on early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Tagrisso, Approval, Cancer, Lung, EGFR-mutated", "meta_description": "China nod for Tagrisso on early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 14:12:36", "updated": "2021-04-14 14:18:08", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/china-nod-for-tagrisso-on-early-stage-egfr-mutated-lung-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "china_regulator_cnmpa_big.jpg", "image2id": "china_regulator_cnmpa_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Lung cancer", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On", "geography_tag": "China", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Tagrisso", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 14:13:00"}
