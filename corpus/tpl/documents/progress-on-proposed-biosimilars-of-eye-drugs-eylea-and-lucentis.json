Sandoz will begin enrolling the first patient in MYLIGHT, a clinical Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study, shortly.</p>\n<p>Aflibercept is indicated to improve visual acuity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema, macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, and other specific neovascular retinal diseases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;nAMD accounts for 10% of all age-related macular degeneration cases, but is responsible for 90% of AMD-related blindness,&rdquo; said Florian Bieber, global head of biopharmaceuticals development, Sandoz, adding: &ldquo;Aflibercept is a key treatment in ophthalmology. The initiation of this study marks an important milestone in the development of our biosimilar aflibercept. As with all our biosimilar programs, we aim to expand access to high-quality, more affordable biologics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>MYLIGHT is part of a comprehensive biosimilar development program including analytical, pre-clinical and clinical data. The study aims to confirm that the proposed biosimilar has equivalent efficacy and comparable safety to the reference medicine in patients with nAMD.</p>\n<h2><strong>Samsung Bioepis releases similarity data on SB11 (ranibizumab)&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Also yesterday, South Korea&rsquo;s Samsung Bioepis announced results from a study analyzing structural and functional similarity between SB11, a proposed ranibizumab biosimilar, and Lucentis (ranibizumab).</p>\n<p>The study results will be presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting 2021<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Through this study, we hope more ophthalmologists understand biosimilar development, how extensively the reference biologic is analyzed, and how quality targets are met through structural and functional analysis.&rdquo; said Donghoon Shin, vice president and medical and lifecycle safety team leader at Samsung Bioepis.</p>\n<p>The Biologics License Application (BLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for SB11 are under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively.</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 10:12:00", "meta_title": "Progress on proposed biosimilars of eye drugs Eylea and Lucentis", "meta_keywords": "Biosimilars, Eylea, Lucentis, Aflibercept, Ranibizumab, Sandoz, Samsung Bioepis, Phase III", "meta_description": "Progress on proposed biosimilars of eye drugs Eylea and Lucentis", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-03 15:11:20", "updated": "2021-05-04 10:12:16", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/progress-on-proposed-biosimilars-of-eye-drugs-eylea-and-lucentis", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eye_stock_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "eye_stock_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": "Ophthalmics", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "South Korea, Switzerland", "company_tag": "Bayer, Novartis, Samsung Bioepis, Sandoz", "drug_tag": "aflibercept, Eylea, Lucentis, Ranibizumab Injection", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 10:12:00"}
