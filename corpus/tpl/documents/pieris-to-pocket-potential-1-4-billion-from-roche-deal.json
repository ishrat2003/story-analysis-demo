This is our second respiratory alliance with a major biopharma company, and we remain deeply committed to inhaled biologics, which have already shown benefit in the clinic. We also look forward to pursuing another local application of our technology in ophthalmology, where Genentech has extensive capabilities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 17:46:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Pieris, Genentech, collaboration, Roche, development, research, programs, agreement, Anticalin, deal, ophthalmological, billion, respiratory, pocket, hours", "meta_description": "Shares in US biotech Pieris Pharmaceuticals rocketed by nearly 50% in three hours of trading on Tuesday on news of a multi-program research collaboration and li", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 17:40:53", "updated": "2021-05-25 18:26:39", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pieris-to-pocket-potential-1-4-billion-from-roche-deal", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "pieris-large.jpg", "image2id": "pieris-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Ophthalmics, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Genentech, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Roche", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 17:46:00"}
