Up to 40% of people with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC present with brain metastases at initial diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Lorlatinib is currently licenced and available on the National Health Service to treat adult patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, after alectinib or ceritinib or after crizotinib and at least 1 other ALK inhibitor. This innovation passport is part of a new regulatory submission to use lorlatinib earlier in the treatment pathway. In the UK, there are over 47,000 diagnoses of lung cancer, and NSCLC makes up the majority (87%) of all cases in England and Wales every year, according to Pfizer.</p>\n<p>Last month, lorlatinib was granted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) by the US Food and Drug Administration expanding the indication for ALK-positive NSCLC, under the trade name Lorbrena. Approval was based on the CROWN trial, which showed a 72% reduction in risk of progression or death for treatment with lorlatinib versus crizotinib in a previously-untreated patient population.</p>", "date": "2021-05-01 14:01:00", "meta_title": "Cancer drug Lorviqua granted \u00e2\u0080\u0098Innovation Passport\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from UK regulator", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, Lorviqua, Cancer, Lung, NSCLC, Innovation passport, MHRA, Lorbrena", "meta_description": "Cancer drug Lorviqua granted \u00e2\u0080\u0098Innovation Passport\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from UK regulator", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-01 14:00:45", "updated": "2021-05-01 14:07:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cancer-drug-lorviqua-granted-innovation-passport-from-uk-regulator", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "mhra_large.png", "image2id": "mhra_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Lorbrena, Lorviqua", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-01 14:01:00"}
