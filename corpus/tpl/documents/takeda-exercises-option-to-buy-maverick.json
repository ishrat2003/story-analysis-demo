Maverick&rsquo;s cutting-edge COBRA platform is an exciting addition to our oncology portfolio that provides a novel conditional bioengineering approach to advance redirected immunotherapies against solid tumors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maverick&rsquo;s COBRA platform is designed to safely target a broad range of solid tumors with highly specific and potent activity while limiting toxicities in normal tissues.</p>\n<p>Unlike standard T-cell engaging immunotherapies that are systemically active when administered, COBRA-engineered, protein-based therapies are engineered to exploit the tumor microenvironment, triggering T-cell-mediated killing only at the site of the tumor while sparing damage to patients&rsquo; healthy tissues.</p>\n<p>The COBRA platform complements Takeda&rsquo;s approach to redirecting immune cells to target cancer with the potential to unlock efficacy in solid tumors.</p>\n<h2>Milestones total $525 million</h2>\n<p>The acquisition follows a multi-year collaboration between the two companies signed in 2017 to develop conditionally active T-cell engager therapies, in which Takeda received an equity stake and an exclusive right to buy Maverick after five years.</p>\n<p>Based on the success of the lead programs and the promise of the COBRA platform, Takeda exercised its option to acquire Maverick for a pre-negotiated upfront payment, previously reported as $125 million, as well as potential development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $525 million, subject to certain adjustments, including for Takeda&rsquo;s current equity stake and Maverick debt.</p>\n<h2>'Singular focus'</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Takeda&rsquo;s exercise of their purchase option is a tribute to the Maverick team&rsquo;s singular focus on improving outcomes for patients with solid tumor cancers,&rdquo; said James Scibetta, chief executive of Maverick.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Through the acquisition, patients will benefit from the expansion of resources and experience Takeda brings to accelerate development of our COBRA-derived therapies. Takeda has been an excellent partner since Maverick&rsquo;s inception, venerating our independence through a period marked by rapid innovation, providing actionable consultation, and providing direct cell line development and manufacturing support through the COVID-19 pandemic to keep us on our aggressive schedule.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-09 13:11:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Maverick, Takeda, solid, option, immunotherapies, tumors, T-cell, development, active, platform, COBRA, Takedas, patients, conditionally, acquire, exercise", "meta_description": "Japanese drugmaker Takeda has announced the exercise of its option to acquire Maverick Therapeutics, a private biopharma company pioneering conditionally active", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 13:03:19", "updated": "2021-03-09 13:59:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/takeda-exercises-option-to-buy-maverick", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "takeda_corporate_building_large.jpg", "image2id": "takeda_corporate_building_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Focus On, Management", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Maverick Therapeutics, Takeda", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-09 13:11:00"}
