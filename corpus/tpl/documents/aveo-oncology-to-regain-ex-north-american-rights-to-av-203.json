The transfer of rights and termination of the collaboration and license agreement will become effective on September 5, 2021.</p>\n<p>To date, AVEO has completed a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of AV-203 in patients with advanced solid tumors (N=22). In this study, one patient had a dose limiting adverse event and the recommended Phase II dose, or RP2D, is 20mg/kg. One of two neuregulin positive (NRG1+) patients had a partial response. Neuregulin, the only known ligand for ErbB3, is a potential biomarker which may prove to be predictive of AV-203 anti-tumor activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Third IgG1 antibody clinical candidate</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;By reacquiring rights to AV-203 outside of North America, we add global rights to a third IgG1 antibody clinical candidate within our internally developed and diverse portfolio of oncology therapeutics,&rdquo; said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive of AVEO, adding: &ldquo;AV-203 has demonstrated early signs of activity in an NRG1+ patient that suggest it could have meaningful application in several areas of high unmet need in cancer.</p>\n<p>Mr Bailey continued: &ldquo;We look forward to advancing AV-203 in the clinic as part of our strategy for delivering long-term value from our pipeline programs. This strategy includes progress in our immunotherapy combination programs for Fotivda (tivozanib), potential initiation of a pivotal study of ficlatuzumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and the execution of our Phase I study of AV-380 for cancer cachexia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Under their 2016 agreement, AVEO granted CANbridge Life Sciences worldwide rights, excluding the USA, Canada, and Mexico, to AV-203, under a deal potentially worth $133 million to AVEO. CANbridge completed its manufacturing obligations under the agreement and AVEO received a $2 million development and regulatory milestone in August 2018 from CANbridge for regulatory approval from the National Medical Products Administration in China of an investigational new drug application for a clinical study of AV-203 in esophageal squamous cell cancer.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-15 14:22:00", "meta_title": "AVEO Oncology to regain ex-North American rights to AV-203", "meta_keywords": "AVEO Oncology, ex-North America, AV-203, Rights, CANBridge Life Sciences, Tumors, Solid, Collaboration, Terminated", "meta_description": "AVEO Oncology to regain ex-North American rights to AV-203", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-15 14:20:55", "updated": "2021-03-15 14:29:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/aveo-oncology-to-regain-ex-north-american-rights-to-av-203", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "aveo_oncology_large.jpg", "image2id": "aveo_oncology_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "China, USA", "company_tag": "AVEO Oncology, CANbridge Life Sciences", "drug_tag": "AV-203", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-15 14:22:00"}
