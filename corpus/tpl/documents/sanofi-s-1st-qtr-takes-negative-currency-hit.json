Exchange rate movements had a negative effect of 6.7 percentage&nbsp;points, mainly driven by the decrease of the US dollar, Brazilian real, Russian rouble, Turkish lira, and Argentine peso and Japanese yen. At constant exchange rates (CER), Sanofi sales increased 2.4%.</p>\n<p>First-quarter business operating income (BOI) increased 4.0% to 2.64 billion. At CER, BOI increased 13.3%. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 2.4 percentage points to 30.7% versus the prior year. Net income was up 14.7% at 2.017 billion euros at CER. Business earnings per share (EPS) were 1.61 euros, up 15% at CER.</p>\n<p>First-quarter 2021 Pharmaceutical sales increased 3.8% to 6.56 million, with double-digit growth of the Specialty Care portfolio mainly driven by the strong performance of Dupixent (dupilumab), which largely offset lower sales in General Medicines in Europe and the USA.</p>\n<p><strong>Full-year 2021 business EPS guidance affirmed</strong></p>\n<p>Sanofi expects 2021 business EPS to grow high single digit at CER, barring unforeseen major adverse events. Applying average April 2021 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2021 business EPS is estimated to be between -4% to -5%.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our strong first-quarter performance is the result of the continued execution of our Play to Win strategy to drive growth and bring innovative medicines to patients. Dupixent continues its outstanding performance with impressive growth in the US and strong uptake in global markets, including China. Vaccines delivered growth in its core segments, said chief executive Paul Hudson, adding: &ldquo;We initiated and completed enrollment of our Phase II study for our recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate in the first quarter and results are expected next month. Following the communication of our ESG strategy at the end of 2020 and embedding it into our business priorities, we have recently created the Sanofi Global Health Unit, dedicated to increasing access to 30 medicines considered essential by the WHO. Sanofi is uniquely positioned to make this difference to society, which can be scaled and sustained over time, given our portfolio of essential medicines and broad geographic presence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Product sales</strong></p>\n<p>In the first quarter, Dupixent (collaboration with Regeneron [Nasdaq: REGN]) sales were strong despite the COVID-19 environment and increased 45.6% to 1,047 million euros.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Neurology and Immunology </strong>sales were down 3.4% to 581 million euros, impacted primarily by the decline of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) sales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aubagio (teriflunomide) sales decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to 500 million euros, due to lower sales in the USA reflecting increased competition partially offset by demand growth partly related to clinical trial supply and price upside in Europe. First-quarter Lemtrada sales decreased 44.9% to 24 million euros, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a decrease in infused immune reconstitution therapies such as Lemtrada.0</p>\n<p>In the first quarter, <strong>Rare Disease</strong>&nbsp;sales increased 4.4% to 770 million euros, primarily driven by higher demand particularly in Rest of the World (up 10.2%). Sales in Europe increased 0.4% and compared to a high base in the first quarter of 2020 due to an inventory build related to the COVID-19 environment.</p>\n<p>First-quarter Cerezyme (imiglucerase) sales increased 4.2% to 178 million euros, driven by strong growth in Rest of the World (up 18.4%).</p>\n<p>In the first quarter, global <strong>Diabetes</strong>&nbsp;sales decreased 1.7% to 1,175 million euros. Toujeo (insulin glargine [rDNA origin]) sales increased 5.1% to 253 million euros driven by the launch in China.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Cardiovascular and Established Rx Products </strong>sales decreased 5.6% to 2.31 billion euros reflecting strong Lovenox (enoxaparin) growth more than offset in particular by lower sales of Aprovel/Avapro (irbesartan)<sup>&nbsp;</sup>divestments and some COVID impact.
