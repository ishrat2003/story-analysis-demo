By now we have passed the milestone of 200 million deliveries in the EU, commented European Commissioner Stella Kyriakides at a press conference yesterday.</p>\n<p>While the EU now has four authorized vaccines, there is one authorized medicine, remdesivir. The EC&rsquo;s Strategy on COVID-19 Therapeutics aims to change this situation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have said that we will leave no stone unturned at the beginning of the pandemic. The Strategy on COVID-19 Therapeutics we are presenting today, adds another stone to our COVID-19 response. It is crucial that alongside vaccines, we also step up our work on therapeutics, and bring the different strands of our work together to speed up recovery, reduce hospital stays and save lives. To help those who are experiencing more long-term effects of this disease. This is also taking a major toll on people, as many of us already know,&rdquo; said Ms Kyriakides.</p>\n<p>She continued: &ldquo;I have set a very clear goal: We will aim to, by October, develop and authorize three new effective COVID-19 therapeutics that can have the potential to change the course of COVID-19, and another two possibly by the end of the year. This is ambitious, but it is feasible &ndash; and it is necessary. We have learned over the course of the past year that by working together across the EU, we are able to achieve real results, to bring about change for our citizens, and to deliver what is expected from us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To do so, she said, the Therapeutics Strategy will kick off a series of actions addressing the entire lifecycle of a medicine, looking at:</p>\n<p>Boosting research and large-scale clinical trials in the EU;</p>\n<p>Scanning for the most promising therapeutics;</p>\n<p>Facilitating the timely authorization process;</p>\n<p>Ensuring industrial production; and</p>\n<p>Securing equitable deployment and ensure fair access.</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 16:44:00", "meta_title": "EU Strategy for the development and availability of therapeutics", "meta_keywords": "European Union, Strategy, Development, Availability, COVID-19, Therapeutics, Commissioner Stella Kyriakides", "meta_description": "EU Strategy for the development and availability of therapeutics", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 16:43:30", "updated": "2021-05-07 16:57:37", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eu-strategy-for-the-development-and-availability-of-therapeutics", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "european_commission_large.jpg", "image2id": "european_commission_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "European Union", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Public health, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": "Stella Kyriakides", "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 16:44:00"}
