This is the first time a licensed immunotherapy has been made available for routine use on the NHS for bowel cancer, and could benefit hundreds of patients every year. This decision particularly offers hope to people diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, who have up to an 80% lifetime risk of bowel cancer, but who carry mutations that mean they are more likely to respond to immunotherapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At MSD, we&rsquo;re committed to getting our innovative new treatments to patients as quickly as possible, and we are pleased to have been able to work effectively with NICE so that they were able to take this decision swiftly for the benefit of patients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK. There are approximately 37,100 new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed in England and Wales every year. Around 22% of these new cases are diagnosed as metastatic (stage IV), and an estimated 4%-5% of stage IV colorectal cancers are MSI-H/dMMR.</p>\n<p>Pembrolizumab was made available in England for eligible patients with metastatic MSI H/dMMR colorectal cancer as an interim treatment option during the COVID-19 pandemic period, in line with NHS England&rsquo;s priorities to reduce patient visits to hospital, make better use of clinical capacity, and provide options which reduce the number of patients on more immunosuppressive therapies during the pandemic.</p>", "date": "2021-05-14 14:08:00", "meta_title": "NICE backs Keytruda for NHS use in a subtype of colorectal cancer", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, Keytruda, NHS use, NICE, Subtype, Colorectal cancer", "meta_description": "NICE backs Keytruda for NHS use in a subtype of colorectal cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-14 14:07:28", "updated": "2021-05-14 14:14:28", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nice-backs-keytruda-for-nhs-us-in-a-subtype-of-colorectal-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "keytruda_merck_large.jpg", "image2id": "keytruda_merck_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co", "drug_tag": "Keytruda", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-14 14:08:00"}
