At nine months vutrisiran also met all secondary endpoints, demonstrating improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) instrument and improvement in gait speed as assessed by the timed 10-meter walk test (10-MWT), both compared to the external placebo group. The majority of patients experienced improvement in neuropathy and in quality of life, both relative to baseline, showing the potential for vutrisiran to reverse polyneuropathy manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis. Vutrisiran also demonstrated an encouraging safety profile with no drug-related discontinuations or deaths.</p>\n<p>Based on these positive data, Alnylam has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with the US Food and Drug Administration requesting approval of vutrisiran for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults.</p>\n<h2><strong>Market prospects</strong></h2>\n<p>The transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) market is expected to grow from $585 million in 2019 to $14.1 billion in 2029 across the seven major markets, according to GlobalData. This would put the market on course for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.5%.</p>\n<p>RNA interference (RNAi) therapies that aim to block production of TTR at the source are expected to help grow the sector. GlobalData noted that this new mechanism is giving Alnylam&rsquo;s Onpattro (patisiran) a huge boost in market share and the trend is set to continue for its second drug vutrisiran, and Akcea's (Nasdaq: AKCA) Tegsedi (inotersen) and AKCEA- TTR-LRx, all of which will compete for market share within the RNAi class.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The HELIOS-A study results demonstrate that vutrisiran improves neuropathy, quality of life and gait speed as soon as 9 months &ndash; compared to the external placebo arm of APOLLO &ndash; in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, with an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. The reversal of polyneuropathy manifestations of disease demonstrated in patients treated with vutrisiran in the study, the encouraging safety profile, and the totality of data from the trial, reinforce our belief in the promise of our RNAi therapeutics&rsquo; mechanism of action, as first established with Onpattro (patisiran). Further, we are encouraged by the exploratory endpoint results showing the impact of vutrisiran on NT-proBNP, a marker of cardiac stress, and look forward to additional data on exploratory cardiac endpoints at the 18-month readout, expected in late 2021,&rdquo; said Dr Akshay Vaishnaw, president of R&amp;D at Alnylam.</p>", "date": "2021-04-20 11:54:00", "meta_title": "HELIOS-A Phase III study of vutrisiran meets goals", "meta_keywords": "Alnylam Pharma, Vutrisiran, Phase III, HELIOS-A, hATTR, Amyloidosis, Onpattro", "meta_description": "HELIOS-A Phase III study of vutrisiran meets goals", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-20 11:52:49", "updated": "2021-04-20 12:01:48", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/helios-a-phase-iii-study-of-vutrisiran-meets-goals", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "alnylam_big.png", "image2id": "alnylam_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Polyneuropathy", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "AAN, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Alnylam Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Onpattro, vutrisiran", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-20 11:54:00"}
