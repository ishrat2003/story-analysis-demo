Under the new agreement, SpyBiotech will leverage Selexis&rsquo; proprietary SUREtechnology Platform to generate cell lines vital to advancing this HCMV program to human clinical trials.</p>\n<p>SpyBiotech&rsquo;s technology is particularly exciting, says Selexis, because it can circumvent the significant complexities and challenges of binding antigens to vaccine delivery platforms. As a result, it may now be possible to develop vaccines previously thought to be too difficult to pursue. Since HCMV may infect nearly one in three US children by the age of five, a vaccine that can be developed quickly will be of great interest to the public health community.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;SpyBiotech&rsquo;s SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology circumvents the significant complexities and challenges of binding antigens to vaccine delivery platforms such as virus-like particles (VLPs), making it possible to tackle the development of vaccines previously deemed too difficult to pursue,&rdquo; said Yemi Onakunle, Selexis chief business officer, adding: &ldquo;The high prevalence of HCMV worldwide along with SpyBiotech&rsquo;s innovative technology and commitment to advancing a vaccine makes our work with the company vitally important. We&rsquo;re excited to move forward.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-19 10:20:00", "meta_title": "Selexis signs license deal with SpyBiotech on HCMV vaccine program", "meta_keywords": "Selexis, SpyBiotech, License, Agreement, Cytomegalovirus, Vaccine, SUREtechnology", "meta_description": "Selexis signs license deal with SpyBiotech on HCMV vaccine program", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-19 10:19:18", "updated": "2021-03-19 10:28:19", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/selexis-signs-license-deal-with-spybiotech-on-hcmv-vaccine-program", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vaccines_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "vaccines_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-virals, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, UK", "company_tag": "JSR Corporation, Selexis, SpyBiotech", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-19 10:20:00"}
