Some 69 of the drugs were classified as novel drugs, of which 20 were approved only in the EU, 48 only in the USA and one in both regions.</p>\n<p>These figures indicate that last year was a year of significant differences in drug approvals across the two regions, where each region assessed and approved products that the other region did not, to a greater extent than has been the case in the last few years.</p>\n<p><img title=\"unnamed-1--2.jpg\" src=\"/media/project_tpl/image/unnamed-1--2.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed-1--2.jpg\" width=\"566\" height=\"800\" /></p>\n<p>Johan Str&ouml;mquist, chief executive, NDA Group, said: &ldquo;It is encouraging to see that, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative drug developers were able to exceed previous years&rsquo; number of submissions, and that the drug regulators have been so productive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the same time, it is troubling to see the big difference in what products have actually been approved in the two regions. This discrepancy indicates that companies are not leveraging the opportunities available for parallel or closely sequential filings across the EU and USA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ingela Loell, NDA&rsquo;s researcher for the report, added: &ldquo;2020 will go down in history as the year of the pandemic, and it still did not put a damper on innovation. A lot of focus in the media has rightly been placed on the development of vaccines and treatments for infected, but 2020 really pushed the frontiers of advanced therapies and products with gene editing components.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We saw approvals of life-saving and life-changing treatments, like Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec), originally developed by AveXis and commercialized by Novartis (NOVN: VX), a gene therapy successfully addressing spinal muscular atrophy. Or Viltepso (viltolarsen) by NS Pharma, an exon 53 skipping treatment aiming to correct a naturally occurring genetic mutation of a protein aggravating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These are but two examples among many of how advanced therapies are continuing to make inroads into medical practice to change the lives of patients worldwide.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Orphan drugs continue to dominate an important section of the new drug approvals, with 34% of the total products having an orphan designation. In spite of the advantages for companies to focus their development in this field, and the boom that we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, the proportion of orphan products remained pretty stable through 2020.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 12:41:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 12:33:40", "updated": "2021-03-31 13:47:40", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nda-group-s-figures-on-usa-and-eu-reflect-record-year-for-new-drug-approvals-despite-pandemic", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "pills_bottle_drugs_syringe_big.jpg", "image2id": "pills_bottle_drugs_syringe_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Europe, USA", "company_tag": "NDA Group", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 12:41:00"}
