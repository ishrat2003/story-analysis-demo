The Court has directed the government to take a decision by April 28, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s India correspondent.</p>\n<p>A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by TB survivor Meera Yadav and Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a non-government organization. The PIL was filed as the drugs, patents of which are solely with the government, are not available regularly, resulting in a break in the treatment regime for the near-fatal ailment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The petition notes bedaquiline and delamanid, together with repurposed drugs linezolid and clofazimine, provide opportunities to cure people with MDR TB.</p>\n<p>Through their counsel Anand Grover, the petitioners said if the government authorizes other manufacturers by giving them the patents, the shortage problem could be resolved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The petitioners told the court that, in 2019 alone, 44,724 MDR-TB patients eligible to receive bedaquiline did not get the drug and 830 patients with XDR-TB did not receive delamanid.</p>\n<p>The Court has asked the Ministry of Health and other departments to explain if it is feasible to invoke compulsory licensing (CL) to prevent big pharma from monopolizing production of these drugs.</p>\n<p>The move for CL has been seconded by activists fighting for expanded access to these drugs, as they are concerned at the lack of transparency with which the Indian government has procured the drug and the government&rsquo;s reliance on a donation program, where patients must depend on the generosity of a pharmaceutical company.</p>\n<h2><strong>Drug donations</strong></h2>\n<p>Senior advocate Anand Grover said after the World Health Organization (WHO) had approved bedaquiline and delamanid as essential drugs for treating MDR and XDR TB, the patent for the medicines had been given to individual nations. After India received the patent, the same was given to two different pharmaceutical companies to undertake the manufacturing of the drugs.</p>\n<p>The petitioners have said the government is currently relying on donations from patent holders - the US-based Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals for bedaquiline and Japan&rsquo;s Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (TYO: 4578) for delamanid - and procure a \"miniscule quantity\" of the drugs compared to what India needs.</p>\n<p>As the cost of the drugs was high and generic drugs were not allowed to be imported, the companies were asked to give the drugs as donations to the government to be used to treat patients. However, due to the high number of patients in India, the government was also forced to procure the medicines at a high price, the petition noted.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the Indian government received 600 courses of bedaquiline from Janssen followed by 22,000 courses from USAID (US Agency for International Development). Similarly, the program received 400 courses of delamanid as donation from Otsuka.</p>\n<p>A six-month course of bedaquiline costs around $358.15 and delamanid costs up to $1259.34 per course, according to the petition, implying that the government would have to shell out huge amounts for the treatment for a single patient being treated under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) also now known as the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) in India.</p>\n<p>Grover said that as generic drugs are available for $8.25 to $17.54 per month for both medicines, the government should issue CL so that other manufacturers can get patents and the burden on the government is reduced.</p>\n<p>The petition noted the Subject Expert Committee of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has also approved their use under programmatic conditions, and the NTEP has included them in the guidelines for the programmatic management of MDR TB in India. However, due to the high cost and procurement problems, TB patients have been facing shortage of these drugs.</p>\n<p>A team of UK researchers have estimated that generic production could slash the price of both drugs to below $137.62 per patient for a six-month course.</p>\n<h2><strong>Generic capability&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Each year nearly two million people in India develop TB, of which around 0.87 million are infectious cases. This has led to an increase in the production and marketing of TB drugs in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indian pharma major Lupin (BSE: 500257) has been the trail blazer and remains the undisputed global heavy weight in the anti-TB drugs space. Apart from India, where the company has close to 50% market share (according to IMS Health), India is also a global leader in drugs like rifampicin, where the country has close to 80% global market share.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the generic TB drugs availability in the Indian market, an analyst said R-Cinex (isoniazid/rifampin) manufactured by Lupin, and Forecox (ethambutol + Isoniazid) manufactured by Macleods are two of the most widely prescribed anti-TB drugs in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Together, they capture close to 15% of the market share in India. Other brands like AKT-4, Combutol, Akurit -4, Pyzina are also prescribed, and together these four brands capture more than 20% of the market sales of anti-TB drugs. They are all manufactured by Lupin.</p>\n<p>Though several manufacturers in India have said they have the capacity and technology to make generic versions of both the patented drugs, no licensing pacts have emerged yet, the petitioners have pointed out.</p>\n<h2><strong>Political cries</strong></h2>\n<p>Political parties too have added their voice. Congress MP TN Prathapan has said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that there is an urgent need to start domestic production of generic medicines required to treat MDR TB.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of taking steps to start domestic generic production of these essential medicines, the RNTCP is depending on donations and charity pricing from the originator companies to treat patients,\" Mr Prathapan said.</p>\n<p>\"The dependency on donation is one of the important barriers in the scaling up of treatment. If the status quo remains, India will not achieve the target of ending TB by 2025,\" Mr Prathapan said, adding the two medicines should be made available to all patients of MDR TB, and that the medicines should be a part of the national list of essential medicines.</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;india_large_credit_deposit_photos</p>\n<p class=\"filename\">&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-30 10:28:00", "meta_title": "Call for CL and cheaper TB drugs grows louder in India", "meta_keywords": "Licenses, Compulsory, Patents, Bedaquiline, Delamanid, TB, Tuberculosis, Janssen, Lupin, Otsuka", "meta_description": "Call for CL and cheaper TB drugs grows louder in India", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-30 09:10:50", "updated": "2021-04-09 10:16:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/call-for-cl-and-cheaper-tb-drugs-grows-louder-in-india", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "india_flag_big.jpg", "image2id": "india_flag_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "TB, Tuberculosis", "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Patents & Trademarks, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "India", "company_tag": "Janssen, Lupin, Otsuka", "drug_tag": "bedaquiline, delamanid", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-30 10:28:00"}
