The technology delivers mRNA cargos selectively to designated types of cells in the body, with initial applications targeting specific types of immune cells.</p>\n<p>The <em>in vivo</em> approach is designed to provide similar efficacy to current <em>ex vivo </em>approaches where immune cells are genetically modified to enhance their therapeutic properties (such as chimeric antigen receptor [CAR]-expressing T-cells), with the potential for improved safety, outpatient dosing, and repeat dosing. Currently, Tidal Therapeutics has ongoing pre-clinical programs including <em>in vivo </em>re-programming of T cells or other types of immune cells for cancer indications.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Teaming up with Sanofi gives us the opportunity to further develop our unique platform and rapidly apply it to ultimately help patients across a range of diseases,&rdquo; said Ulrik Nielsen, president and chief executive of Tidal Therapeutics.</p>\n<p>The announcement came on the same day that Sanofi completed its acquisition of Kymab, for which is paid $1.1 billion upfront with $300 million contingent. With the deal, Sanofi acquires Kymab&rsquo;s KY1005, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to OX40-Ligand, which has the potential for a broad range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders.</p>", "date": "2021-04-10 15:59:00", "meta_title": "Sanofi snaps up US biotech to expand I-O portfolio", "meta_keywords": "Sanofi, Tidal Therapeutics, Acquisition, M&A, Immuno-oncology, Inflammatory diseases", "meta_description": "Sanofi snaps up US biotech to expand I-O portfolio", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-10 15:56:38", "updated": "2021-04-10 16:05:18", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-snaps-up-us-biotech-to-expand-i-o-portfolio", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "2020_sanofi_big.jpg", "image2id": "2020_sanofi_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology, Inflammatory diseases", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions", "geography_tag": "France, USA", "company_tag": "Sanofi, Tidal Therapeutics", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-10 15:59:00"}
