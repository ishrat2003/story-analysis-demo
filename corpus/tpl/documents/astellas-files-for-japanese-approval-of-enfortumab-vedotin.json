The only country to have cleared the drug for marketing so far is the USA.</p>\n<p>The submission is based on two global clinical trials with sites in Japan. The Phase III EV-301 trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. The Phase II EV-201 trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, including those who have also been treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy (cohort 1) and those who have not received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and who are ineligible for cisplatin (cohort 2).</p>\n<p>Enfortumab vedotin met the primary endpoints of overall survival (EV-301) and confirmed objective response rate per blinded independent central review (EV-201).</p>\n<h2><strong>New option for patients who did not respond to current chemotherapy and immunotherapy</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;More than 24,000 people in Japan are diagnosed with urothelial cancer each year. For those whose cancer progresses despite treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, there is no standard treatment option currently,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Krivoshik, senior vice president and oncology therapeutic area head at Astellas, adding: &ldquo;Based on data from two global clinical trials, and following the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare&rsquo;s review, enfortumab vedotin may offer a new option for these patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv), for certain people with bladder cancer. The drug is partnered with Seagen (Nasdaq: SGEN) for the American market. Astellas and Seagen have since submitted two supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) to the FDA for Padcev: seeking to convert Padcev&rsquo;s accelerated approval to regular approval; and to include patients with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and are ineligible for cisplatin.</p>\n<h2><strong>Market prospects</strong></h2>\n<p>The bladder cancer therapeutics market was valued at $670 million in 2018 across the seven major markets (7MM: USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan) and is expected to grow exponentially at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6% - accruing slightly less than $5.6 billion in 2028, according to analytics firm GlobalData.</p>\n<p>Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData believe that therapies such as Padcev, and its combination with Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab), sacituzumab govitecan, and bempegaldesleukin in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo (nivolumab), carry tremendous potential to benefit muscle invasive, locally-advanced and metastatic bladder cancer patients.</p>\n<p>The leading therapies in terms of total annual sales in 2028 will be Padcev and Keytruda, with forecast annual sales of $2.1 billion and $1.1 billion respectively, GlobalData forecast.</p>", "date": "2021-03-11 12:41:00", "meta_title": "Astellas files for Japanese approval of enfortumab vedotin", "meta_keywords": "Astellas, Enfortumab vedotin, NDA, Submission, Japan, Cancer, Urothelial, Bladder, Padcev, Seagen", "meta_description": "Astellas files for Japanese approval of enfortumab vedotin", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-11 12:40:11", "updated": "2021-03-11 12:48:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astellas-files-for-japanese-approval-of-enfortumab-vedotin", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astellasuk-big.jpg", "image2id": "astellasuk-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Metastatic urothelial cancer", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Japan", "company_tag": "Astellas, Seagen", "drug_tag": "enfortumab vedotin, Padcev", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-11 12:41:00"}
