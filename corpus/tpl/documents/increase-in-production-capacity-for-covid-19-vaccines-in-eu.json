The recommendation by the Agency&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/chmp\">CHMP</a> is expected to have a significant impact on the supply of Comirnaty, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Germany&rsquo;s BioNTech (Nasdaq (BNTX) and Pfizer, in the European Union.</p>\n<p>Based on the review of the data submitted by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, the application to increase the batch size of the finished product manufactured at the Puurs site has been approved. The EMA&rsquo;s decision reaffirms that the Puurs facility is capable of consistently producing high-quality vaccines and enables Pfizer/BioNTech to scale up the production process at this site.</p>\n<h2><strong>New filling line for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/chmp\">CHMP</a> also recommended the approval of a new filling line at Moderna&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: MRNA) finished product manufacturing site for the EU in Rovi, Spain.
