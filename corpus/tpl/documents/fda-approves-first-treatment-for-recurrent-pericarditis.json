The company said commercial launch is expected in April 2021.</p>\n<p>Recurrent pericarditis is characterized by a remitting-relapsing inflammation (or symptoms that fluctuate in severity) of the pericardium, a thin tissue sac surrounding the heart. Pericarditis often causes chest pain, which can be sharp. This chest pain worsens when patients take a deep breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The approval of Arcalyst in recurrent pericarditis offers patients the first and only FDA approved therapy for this devastating disease and also represents a transformational event for Kiniksa,&rdquo; said Sanj Patel, chief executive and chairman of Kiniksa. &ldquo;We look forward to launching Arcalyst for recurrent pericarditis with the support of our experienced commercial and medical affairs teams and, importantly, providing this breakthrough therapy to patients suffering with this debilitating disease as quickly as possible,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>The efficacy and safety of Arcalyst were0 evaluated in a double-blind, randomized study enrolling 86 patients with symptomatic pericarditis recurrence. Everyone first received Arcalyst for 12 weeks. After that point, one half of patients continued to receive Arcalyst 160 mg weekly and the other half received a placebo. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the time to first pericarditis recurrence. Results showed that 23 (74%) patients in the placebo arm had a recurrence compared to two (7%) patients on Arcalyst, both of whom had temporarily stopped treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Drug, discovered by Regeneron, gained earlier approvals</strong></h2>\n<p>Arcalyst was discovered by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: REGN), and received initial FDA approval in February 2008 for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome, and subsequent approval for the maintenance of remission of deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) in December 2020</p>\n<p>Kiniksa licensed Arcalyst from Regeneron in 2017 for evaluation in diseases believed to be mediated by both interleukin (IL)-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta;, including recurrent pericarditis. Upon this approval by the FDA for recurrent pericarditis, Kiniksa takes responsibility for sales and distribution of Arcalyst for all the approved indications in the USA, including CAPS and DIRA, and will evenly split profits with Regeneron, as described in the Arcalyst license agreement.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-19 12:39:00", "meta_title": "FDA approves first treatment for recurrent pericarditis", "meta_keywords": "Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Arcalyst, Rilonacept, FDA, Approval, Pericarditis, Regeneron", "meta_description": "FDA approves first treatment for recurrent pericarditis", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-19 12:38:39", "updated": "2021-03-19 12:47:03", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-first-treatment-for-recurrent-pericarditis", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "kiniksa_big.png", "image2id": "kiniksa_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Bermuda, USA", "company_tag": "Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Arcalyst, Rilonacept", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": "Recurrent pericarditis", "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-19 12:39:00"}
