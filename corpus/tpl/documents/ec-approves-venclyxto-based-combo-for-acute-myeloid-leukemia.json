{"contentid": 488740, "importid": NaN, "name": "EC approves Venclyxto-based combo for acute myeloid leukemia", "introduction": "The European Commission has approved Venclyxto (venetoclax) in combination with hypomethylating agents, azacitidine and decitabine, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.", "content": "<p>The European Commission has approved Venclyxto (venetoclax) in combination with hypomethylating agents, azacitidine and decitabine, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by USA-based AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Swiss pharma giant Roche (ROG: SIX). It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Roche subsidiary Genentech in the USA, and commercialized&nbsp;by AbbVie outside of the USA. The drug generated first quarter 2021 sales of $405 million for AbbVie, of which $225 million came from the USA.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This Venclyxto&nbsp;approval is a critical step in providing new therapeutic options for patients in the EU newly diagnosed with AML who cannot tolerate the side effects of, or are ineligible for, intensive chemotherapy,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche&rsquo;s chief medical officer and head of global product development.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The approval is based on the results of two key studies, Phase III VIALE-A and Phase I/II M14-358, of Venclyxto&nbsp;in combination with&nbsp;hypomethylating&nbsp;agents in adults with newly diagnosed AML, who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Results from the VIALE-A study showed&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;plus&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;significantly reduced the risk of death by 34%, compared to&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;alone (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.85; p&lt;0.001). The median overall survival was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 18.7) in the&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;group and 9.6 months (95% CI: 7.4, 12.7) in the control group.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;combination more than doubled the complete responses (CRs), with a CR rate of 37% (95% CI: 31, 43) compared to 18% (95% CI: 12, 25) in the comparator arm (p&lt;0.001). The&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;plus&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;combination also led to higher rates of composite complete remission (CR + CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CR +&nbsp;CRi]) at 66% (95% CI: 61, 72) compared to 28% (95% CI: 21, 36) with&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;alone (p&lt;0.001). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (&ge;5%) in patients receiving&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;in combination with&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, sepsis and&nbsp;haemorrhage.</p>\n<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s approval reinforces the potential of Venclyxto-based combinations to provide clinically meaningful benefits across several disease areas, including AML. Venclexta is already approved in the USA in combination with&nbsp;azacitidine, decitabine, or low dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in adults 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Venclexta/Venclyxto is also approved in the USA and European Union in combination with MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL; and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in people who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-26 10:19:00", "meta_title": "EC approves Venclyxto-based combo for acute myeloid leukemia", "meta_keywords": "Venclexta/Venclyxto, Leukemia, Myeloid, AML, AbbVie, Genentech, Roche, European Commission, Approval", "meta_description": "EC approves Venclyxto-based combo for acute myeloid leukemia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-26 09:20:44", "updated": "2021-05-26 10:19:44", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ec-approves-venclyxto-based-combo-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "venclexta_large.jpg", "image2id": "venclexta_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Genentech, Roche", "drug_tag": "Venclexta, Venclyxto", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-26 10:19:00"}
