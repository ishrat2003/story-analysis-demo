Full-scale production of the vaccine is due to start this summer. The company&rsquo;s facilities comply with GMP standards and are prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>\n<p>Sputnik V was registered in India under the emergency use authorization procedure on April 12, 2021 and vaccination against coronavirus with the Russian vaccine started on May 14. As announced in April, RDIF and Panacea have agreed to produce 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To date Sputnik V has been registered in 66 countries globally with total population of over 3.2 billion people. Efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6% based on the analysis of data on coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020, to March 31, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev commented: &ldquo;Launch of production in India in partnership with Panacea Biotec marks an important step in helping the country fight the pandemic. Production of Sputnik V supports efforts of India&rsquo;s authorities to leave behind the acute phase of coronavirus as soon as possible while the vaccine will also be exported at a later stage to help prevent the spread of the virus in other countries around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This marks a significant step as we initiate production of Sputnik V. Together with RDIF, we hope to help bring a sense of normalcy back to people across the country and around the world,&rdquo; added Panacea&rsquo;s managing director Dr Rajesh Jain.</p>\n<p><strong>Sputnik V effective in Manaus variant</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the RDIF also announces that a study carried out by Argentina&rsquo;s Institute of Virology of the National University of Cordoba and the government of Cordoba has confirmed neutralization effectiveness of the Russian two-dose Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine against the Manaus (Brazilian) variant and overall strong immune response after vaccination with Sputnik V.</p>\n<p>The study specifically confirmed that the immunity generated thanks to vaccination with Sputnik V neutralizes the Manaus (Brazilian) variant in those who received one dose as well as subjects inoculated with two doses of the vaccine.
