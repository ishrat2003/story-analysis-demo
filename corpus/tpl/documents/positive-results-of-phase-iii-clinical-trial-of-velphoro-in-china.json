This is another important step in our geographic expansion and will further strengthen the position of Velphoro as a global leader in the calcium-free phosphate binder market.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Importantly, patients who received Velphoro experienced additional benefits compared to those in the sevelamer control group:&nbsp;Serum phosphorus levels in patients treated with Velphoro declined faster than in the sevelamer group and the average number of tablets taken daily (3.23) was significantly lower than with sevelamer carbonate (6.31). Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of Velphoro with new safety signal observed in Chinese CKD patients with no hyperphosphataemia.</p>\n<h2><strong>China regulatory filing plan</strong></h2>\n<p>VFMCRP intends to submit the Chinese New Drug Application to China&rsquo;s National Medical Products Administration&rsquo;s CDE at the end of 2021. Velphoro gained European approval in 2014 and the USA in 2013.</p>\n<p>This phase-III study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the change from baseline at week 12 in serum phosphorus between PA21 (Velphoro) and sevelamer carbonate, and support market expansion of Velphoro to China.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-30 10:05:00", "meta_title": "Positive results of Phase-III clinical trial of Velphoro in China", "meta_keywords": "Vifor Fresenius, VFMCRP, Velphoro, Phase III, Kidney disease, Hyperphosphatemia, China, NMPA, Submission", "meta_description": "Positive results of Phase-III clinical trial of Velphoro in China", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-30 09:54:36", "updated": "2021-04-30 10:05:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-results-of-phase-iii-clinical-trial-of-velphoro-in-china", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vifor-big.jpg", "image2id": "vifor-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma", "drug_tag": "Velphoro", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-30 10:05:00"}
