{"contentid": 488672, "importid": NaN, "name": "Eisai launches Remitoro for PTCL and CTCL in Japan", "introduction": "Japanese pharma major Eisai today announced the launch on its domestic market of Remitoro (denileukin diftitox) to treat relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).", "content": "<p>Japanese pharma major Eisai (TYO: 4523) today announced the launch on its domestic market of Remitoro (denileukin diftitox) to treat relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).</p>\n<p>Eisai obtained the manufacturing and marketing approval of Remitoro, marketed elsewhere as Ontak, on March 23, 2021. Rights were acquired from Ligand Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: LGND) in 2006. Remitoro was included in Japan&rsquo;s National Health Insurance Drug Price List on May 19, 2021.</p>\n<p>The agent is a fusion protein consisting of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and partial sequence of diphtheria toxin, and specifically binds to the IL-2 receptor on the surface of tumoral lymphocytes. The antitumor efficacy of denileukin diftitox is believed to depend on the intracellular delivery of diphtheria toxin fragment which inhibits protein synthesis and induce cell death.</p>\n<p>The approval of Remitoro in Japan is based primarily on data from Study 205, which is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical study, conducted in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the agent in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL.</p>\n<p>Eisai will conduct a post-marketing special use results survey (all-case surveillance) in all patients who are administered the agent until a pre-determined number of patients has been reached in accordance with an approval condition imposed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW).</p>\n<p>According to a survey by the MHLW, it is estimated that, in Japan, the number of patients with PTCL is less than 6,000 and the number of patients with CTCL is less than 4,000. These diseases may have a poor prognosis or be difficult to treat. Therefore, these are still diseases with extremely high-unmet medical need.</p>", "date": "2021-05-19 12:08:00", "meta_title": "Eisai launches Remitoro for PTCL and CTCL in Japan", "meta_keywords": "Eisai, Remitoro, Launch,  Lymphoma,  PTCL, CTCL, Japan", "meta_description": "Eisai launches Remitoro for PTCL and CTCL in Japan", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-19 12:07:12", "updated": "2021-05-19 12:16:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eisai-launches-remitoro-for-ptcl-and-ctcl-in-japan", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eisaibig.jpg", "image2id": "eisaismall.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Cutaneous T cell lymphoma", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Product Launch", "geography_tag": "Japan", "company_tag": "Eisai", "drug_tag": "Ontak, Remitoro", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-19 12:08:00"}
