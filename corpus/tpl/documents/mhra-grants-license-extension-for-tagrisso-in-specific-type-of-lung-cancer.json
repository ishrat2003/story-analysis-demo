NICE guidance is not expected to be published until September 2021 at the earliest.</p>\n<p>Carles Escriu, consultant in thoracic medical oncology at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool, said: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s news is potentially practice-changing because, for the first time, we have access to a targeted treatment for early-stage lung cancer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Osimertinib is a well-tolerated, once-daily tablet treatment and data show that, when taken after surgery, it can reduce the risk of disease recurrence or death by 80% after two years of treatment in patients with Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC who have an EGFR mutation. Early-stage lung cancer patients can now be tested for EGFR mutations to give them the chance of delaying the return of cancer after surgery.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Arun Krishna, head of oncology, AstraZeneca UK, added: &ldquo;Patients diagnosed in the earlier stages of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC have the best chance of living disease-free, but many see their cancer return. Osimertinib, which was discovered by AstraZeneca scientists in the UK, could significantly improve patient outcomes in a disease setting that has had no new treatment options in over a decade.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With this in mind, we have worked with urgency to secure the MHRA license and access in England to bring this treatment option to patients as quickly as possible. We will continue to work with authorities in the other nations of the UK to secure patient access at the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 17:03:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "cancer, access, MHRA, lung, treatment, Tagrisso, patients, osimertinib, patient, license, extension, EGFR, type, specific, grants, beneficiary, Medicines", "meta_description": "AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tagrisso (osimertinib) is the beneficiary of the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (MHRA) first authorization under Proje", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 15:44:11", "updated": "2021-05-07 17:03:16", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mhra-grants-license-extension-for-tagrisso-in-specific-type-of-lung-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca-location-big.jpg", "image2id": "astrazeneca-location-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Pricing, reimbursement and access, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Sweden, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Tagrisso", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 17:03:00"}
