The action date is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>\n<p>Cyltezo is not commercially available in the USA at this time, but, following resolution of all intellectual property-related litigation in 2019 with AbbVie concerning the biosimilar, the German drugmaker reached a settlement on a license period for Cyltezo to begin on July 1, 2023, a date that places Boehringer Ingelheim among the first companies to bring an alternative treatment option to Humira to US patients.</p>", "date": "2021-04-24 14:29:00", "meta_title": "Boehringer says data supports interchangeability of Cyltezo with Humir", "meta_keywords": "Boehringer Ingelheim, Interchangeability, Cyltezo, Humira, Phase III, sBLA, Filing, Plaque psoriasis", "meta_description": "Boehringer says data supports interchangeability of Cyltezo with Humira", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-24 14:27:59", "updated": "2021-04-24 14:36:05", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/boehringer-says-data-supports-interchangeability-of-cyltezo-with-humira", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "boehringer_headquarters_flags_large.jpg", "image2id": "boehringer_headquarters_flags_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Dermatologicals, Inflammatory diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Germany, USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim", "drug_tag": "Cyltezo, Humira", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-24 14:29:00"}
