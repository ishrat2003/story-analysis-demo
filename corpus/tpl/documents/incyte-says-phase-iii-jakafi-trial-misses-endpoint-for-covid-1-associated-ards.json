The most common adverse events on the ruxolitinib arms, regardless of dose, compared to placebo were anemia (20.7% vs 22.2%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 14.6% vs 13.3%), increased aspartate transaminase (AST, 14.0% vs. 8.9%) and hypertension (11.6% vs. 11.1%), respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Will make drug available free under EAP</strong></p>\n<p>Given the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, Incyte plans to make ruxolitinib available to eligible patients in the USA at no cost via an Expanded Access Program (EAP) pending agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration. The protocol will allow eligible patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS with disease severity requiring mechanical ventilation to receive ruxolitinib.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There remains a significant unmet medical need for treatments that may potentially improve survival outcomes for patients suffering from severe COVID-19 related complications, specifically those requiring mechanical ventilation,&rdquo; said Dr Steven Stein, chief medical officer, Incyte. &ldquo;We hope the results of this study, and the potential utility of ruxolitinib for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS, will contribute to the advances being made across the scientific community to alleviate the burden this pandemic has placed on patients, as well as the healthcare system. We look forward to discussing the results of the DEVENT study with regulatory authorities in the United States,&rdquo; added Dr Stein.</p>", "date": "2021-03-19 11:08:00", "meta_title": "Incyte says Phase III Jakafi trial misses endpoint for COVID-1-associa", "meta_keywords": "Incyte, Jakafi, Phase III, DEVENT study, ARDS, COVID-19 associated, Respiratory failure, Novartis", "meta_description": "Incyte says Phase III Jakafi trial misses endpoint for COVID-1-associated ARDS", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-19 11:06:58", "updated": "2021-03-19 11:15:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/incyte-says-phase-iii-jakafi-trial-misses-endpoint-for-covid-1-associated-ards", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "incytebig.jpg", "image2id": "incytesmall.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Incyte, Novartis", "drug_tag": "COVID-19, Jakafi", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-19 11:08:00"}
