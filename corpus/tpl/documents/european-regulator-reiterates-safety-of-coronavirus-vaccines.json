On all such matters, the EMA advised that it will communicate further when new information becomes available.</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 14:26:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "safety, vaccines, European, PRAC, coronavirus, cases, blood, panel, committee, benefit-risk, reaffirmed, reports, reiterates, regulator, approved, vaccine", "meta_description": "Minutes from the May meeting of the European Medicines Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety committee show the panel has reaffirmed the positive benefit-risk ratio of approved coron", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 14:26:30", "updated": "2021-05-07 15:09:07", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/european-regulator-reiterates-safety-of-coronavirus-vaccines", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "europe_flag_eu_big.jpg", "image2id": "europe_flag_eu_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Public health, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, mRNA-1273, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 14:26:00"}
