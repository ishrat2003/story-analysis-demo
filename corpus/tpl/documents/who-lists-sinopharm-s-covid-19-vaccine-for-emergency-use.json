The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sinopharm jab is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get WHO backing. The vaccine has already been given to millions of people in China and elsewhere. A decision is expected in the coming days on another Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac, while Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is under assessment.</p>\n<h2><strong>Other WHO COVID-19 vaccine listings</strong></h2>\n<p>The WHO has also listed the Pfizer NYSE: PFE/BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX) vaccine for emergency use on December 31, 2020; two AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN)/Oxford COVID-19 vaccines on February 15, 2021, produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India; and COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S developed by Janssen, a part of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)) on March 12, 2021.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The addition of this vaccine has the potential to rapidly accelerate COVID-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk,&rdquo; said Dr Mari&acirc;ngela Sim&atilde;o, WHO Assistant Director General for Access to Health Products. &ldquo;We urge the manufacturer to participate in the COVAX Facility and contribute to the goal of more equitable vaccine distribution,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings. It is the also first vaccine that will carry a vaccine vial monitor, a small sticker on the&nbsp;vaccine vials that change color as the&nbsp;vaccine&nbsp;is exposed to heat, letting health workers know whether the vaccine can be safely&nbsp;used.</p>\n<p>WHO&rsquo;s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-10 11:17:00", "meta_title": "WHO lists Sinopharm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use", "meta_keywords": "Sinopharm, COVID-19, Vaccine, WHO, Listing, Emergency use, Beijing BioInstitute of Biological Products, China National Biotec", "meta_description": "WHO lists Sinopharm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-09 15:38:34", "updated": "2021-05-10 11:17:40", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/who-lists-sinopharm-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "who_flag_big.jpg", "image2id": "who_flag_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "China, Global", "company_tag": "China National Biotec, Sinopharm, World Health Organisation", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-10 11:17:00"}
