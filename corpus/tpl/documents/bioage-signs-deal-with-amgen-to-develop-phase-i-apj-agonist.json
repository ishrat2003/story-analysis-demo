APJ and its natural agonist apelin are components of a signaling pathway that regulates multiple aspects of muscle metabolism, growth, and repair.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the license accord, which covers all indications, BioAge will make an upfront payment to Amgen, which is entitled to receive development and regulatory milestone payments plus royalties based on annual net sales. Amgen will also receive an unspecified number of shares in BioAge. BioAge will be responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercialization of BGE-105 worldwide.</p>\n<h2><strong>Second buy-in this year</strong></h2>\n<p>This is the second in-licensing deal this year for BioAge, which in January picked up exclusive US and European development and marketing rights to the DP1 receptor antagonist, BGE-175, in COVID-19, from Osaka, Japan-based Shionogi (TYO: 4507). The firm has also obtained exclusive rights to negotiate a license for additional indications.</p>\n<p>BGE-105 is a potent APJ agonist that can be administered orally or intravenously. Phase I clinical trials completed in 2019 in 198 subjects who received the drug for up to 21 days showed that BGE-105 had a tolerable safety profile, with acceptable pharmacokinetics (PK) supporting once-daily administration. BioAge&rsquo;s first clinical trial of BGE-105, planned for initiation in the first quarter of 2022 under the existing investigational new drug (IND), will be a Phase I study comparing the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of BGE-105 in humans with those seen in previous trials examining the effects of the apelin peptide.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;BioAge&rsquo;s advanced proprietary platform comprehensively analyzes longitudinal human data to identify key molecular drivers of aging, which we then validate in preclinical experiments,&rdquo; said Kristen Fortney, BioAge&rsquo;s chief executive, adding: &ldquo;Using this robust approach, we found that higher levels of apelin signalling in older people are associated with increased lifespan and reduced symptoms of frailty. Our human-first analysis suggests that the apelin-mimicking drug BGE-105 could recapitulate these positive effects in older patients.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 16:34:00", "meta_title": "BioAge signs deal with Amgen to develop Phase I APJ agonist", "meta_keywords": "BioAge Labs, Amgen, License, Agreement, APJ agonist, AMG 986, BGE;105", "meta_description": "BioAge signs deal with Amgen to develop Phase I APJ agonist", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 16:33:16", "updated": "2021-04-15 16:50:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bioage-signs-deal-with-amgen-to-develop-phase-i-apj-agonist", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "bioage_big.jpg", "image2id": "bioage_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Amgen, BioAge Labs", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 16:34:00"}
