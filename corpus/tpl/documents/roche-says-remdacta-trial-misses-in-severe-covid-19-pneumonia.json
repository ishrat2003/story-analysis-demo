No new safety signals were identified for Actemra/RoActemra in the REMDACTA trial, the Swiss pharma giant said.</p>\n<p>The study was conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD), which markets Veklury, anti-viral agent that generated $1.9 billion sales in the fourth quarter of 2020. Veklury in October last year became the first drug to gain full US Food and Drug Administration approval for COVID-19. It was previously cleared under the emergency use system.</p>\n<h2><strong>EMPACTA study met its primary endpoint</strong></h2>\n<p>Roche will continue to evaluate data from the REMDACTA, COVACTA and EMPACTA studies as well as other studies of Actemra/RoActemra in COVID-19 pneumonia. The EMPACTA study met its primary endpoint, while COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint. Both were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the global impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on patients, we are disappointed that the REMDACTA study did not meet its endpoints,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, chief medical officer and head of global product development. &ldquo;We continue to believe that the totality of data suggests a potential role for Actemra in treating certain patients with COVID-19, and will discuss the results with health authorities. We thank our partners at Gilead, and all the patients, investigators and healthcare professionals for their participation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>REMDACTA did not meet key secondary endpoints, which included likelihood of death, likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death, and clinical status. The full results of the trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal later this year.</p>\n<p>Actemra/RoActemra is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>", "date": "2021-03-11 10:13:00", "meta_title": "Roche says REMDACTA trial misses in severe COVID-19 pneumonia", "meta_keywords": "Roche, Actemra/RoActemra, Phase III,  REMDACTA trial, COVID-19 pneumonia, Gilead, Veklury", "meta_description": "Roche says REMDACTA trial misses in severe COVID-19 pneumonia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-11 10:11:59", "updated": "2021-03-11 10:21:57", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roche-says-remdacta-trial-misses-in-severe-covid-19-pneumonia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "roche_sign_large.jpg", "image2id": "roche_sign_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Pneumonia", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Roche", "drug_tag": "Actemra/RoActemra, Veklury", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-11 10:13:00"}
