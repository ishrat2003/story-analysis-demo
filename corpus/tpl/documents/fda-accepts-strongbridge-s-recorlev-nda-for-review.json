Within the Day 74 letter, the FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of January 1, 2022, which reflects a projected 10-month standard review period. The letter made no mention of a plan to hold an advisory committee meeting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the FDA's acceptance for filing of the Recorlev New D0rug Application. We believe this decision reflects the comprehensive clinical evidence that went into the NDA submission, including the positive and statistically significant efficacy and safety results from the multinational Phase III SONICS and LOGICS studies evaluating Recorlev as a potential treatment option for adults with endogenous Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome. We are advancing our commercial readiness plans and look forward to potentially bringing a new therapeutic option to the Cushing's syndrome community in the first quarter of 2022,&rdquo; said John Johnson, chief executive of Strongbridge Biopharma.</p>\n<p>In March this year, Strongbridge filed an application with the FDA seeking the approval of Recorlev to treat people with <a href=\"https://cushingsdiseasenews.com/what-is-cushings-disease/\">endogenous Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome</a>. According to Strongbridge, currently nearly 40% of patients with endogenous Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome are unable to control their cortisol levels with prescribed therapies, highlighting the need for more effective medicines.</p>", "date": "2021-05-13 16:58:00", "meta_title": "FDA accepts Strongbridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Recorlev NDA for review", "meta_keywords": "Strongbridge Biopharma, Recorlev, Cushing's syndrome, NDA, Accepted, FDA, PDUFA", "meta_description": "FDA accepts Strongbridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Recorlev NDA for review", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-13 16:57:35", "updated": "2021-05-13 17:03:58", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-strongbridge-s-recorlev-nda-for-review", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "strongbridge_large.png", "image2id": "strongbridge_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Endocrinology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Strongbridge Biopharma", "drug_tag": "Recorlev", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": "Endogenous Cushing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syndrome", "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-13 16:58:00"}
