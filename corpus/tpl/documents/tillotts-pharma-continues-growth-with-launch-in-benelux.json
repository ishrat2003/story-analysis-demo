In November 2020, Tillotts acquired the rights to Dificlir (fidaxomicin) from Astellas Pharma&rsquo;s (TYO: 4503) European subsidiary. The drug is for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI), and marks the next important step in opening new affiliates in Europe.</p>\n<p>The new structure will allow the company to fully exploit its potential by offering innovative pharmaceutical products in the field of gastroenterology and beyond. Given the geographical proximity, the Benelux organization will be managed by Tillotts Pharma France, which relies on strong expertise within the gastrointestinal therapeutic area working closely together with scientific experts, medical and patients&rsquo; organizations.</p>\n<p>By being present in the top five European Union markets Tillotts continues to pursue its goal of building a strong commercial structure with group affiliates in strategic markets. With more than 30 million inhabitants, the Benelux region is offering substantial growth opportunities. Edouard Bieth, managing director Tillotts Pharma France, says: &ldquo;Benelux represents the 6th biggest pharma market in Europe emphasising the necessity of being present in this region. Taking this important step now reflects our ambition to become a leader in gastroenterology.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Dificlir will drive sustainable growth</strong></h2>\n<p>With the latest acquisition of Dificlir, which will drive sustainable growth for the group, the company stresses its strategic course in further developing towards an innovative and balanced product portfolio. Benelux started the distribution of Dificlir early in April 2021. In addition to successfully integrating Dificlir within Europe and offering patients with CDI a first-line treatment option, Tillotts will also continue to lay great importance and focus on IBD, where demand continues to grow, as well as other specialty therapeutics.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We aim at a strong presence and performance in all key markets and become the preferred partner in GI,&rdquo; says Mattias Norrman, chief operations officer at Tillotts, adding: &ldquo;By working closely with healthcare professionals to provide better healthcare solutions, Tillotts will help to enhance the outcome for millions of people with gastrointestinal diseases.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 13:29:00", "meta_title": "Tillotts Pharma continues growth with launch in Benelux", "meta_keywords": "Tillotts Pharma, Presence, Benelux, Dificir, CDI", "meta_description": "Tillotts Pharma continues growth with launch in Benelux", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 13:28:47", "updated": "2021-05-25 13:57:54", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/tillotts-pharma-continues-growth-with-launch-in-benelux", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tillotts_pharma_company.png", "image2id": "tillotts_pharma_company.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Antibiotics", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Management", "geography_tag": "Benelux, Switzerland", "company_tag": "Tillotts Pharma", "drug_tag": "Dificlir", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 13:29:00"}
