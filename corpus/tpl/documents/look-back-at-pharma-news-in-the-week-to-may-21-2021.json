Editor</p>\n<p>Last week, US biotech Sarepta Therapeutics impressed with early-stage data on SRP-9001, a gene therapy candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy under development with Roche. GlaxoSmithKline reported positive results from a Phase II trial of a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine being developed with Medicago. Ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting next month, Bristol Myers Squibb last Wednesday outlined its planned presentations, with a strong focus on its next-generation checkpoint blocker relatlimab, which has implications for Immutep. Also, Eli Lilly released new data on tirzepatide compared to insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes patients.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sarepta finds faith in big batch gene therapy data</strong></h2>\n<p>The failure of a placebo-controlled trial of Sarepta&rsquo;s Roche-partnered Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy SRP-9001 might have erased 50% of the company&rsquo;s market cap, but it has done nothing to dent executives' confidence, noted Amy Brown writing on Evaluate Vantage. <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/early-stage-trial-shows-positive-profile-for-sarepta-s-dmd-candidate-srp-9001\">Presenting new data</a> from patients treated with commercial process material, the group's chief executive, Doug Ingram, bullishly claimed to have addressed all the issues raised when Study 102 disappointed. The setback was blamed on an imbalance in baseline characteristics in older children and lower than expected gene expression in some subjects; today&rsquo;s consistent results put those concerns to bed, investors were told last Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The 13% climb in Sarepta&rsquo;s share price that day suggests that only those already keeping the faith will find comfort in these new data. Others will need to see results from a placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, which the company hopes to start towards the end of the year, after meeting the FDA in the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also commenting, SVB Leerink Research analyst Joseph Schwartz pointed out that, unlike other sponsors developing therapies for DMD that have safety issues, including SLDB&rsquo;s (OP) more recent inflammatory response, Sarepta&rsquo;s SRP-9001 that uses an AAVrh74 vector (versus AAV9) appears to have the safest program so far. Based on today&rsquo;s update, SRPT has not observed complement activation. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was vomiting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Sarepta will have several other chances to further redeem itself over the next 12 months, he said. While the Study 103 data are a step in the right direction, Leerink&rsquo;s thesis remains that Sarepta will need to string together multiple wins this year to regain investor confidence. Following these data announced today, SRPT plans to seek a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration with the goal of rapidly starting a registrational study &ndash; management expects this meeting to occur in mid-2021, with the trial beginning soon after. There is also the potential for Sarepta to initiate a pivotal trial with the company&rsquo;s other gene therapy this year, SRP-9003 for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy/LGMD2E. Additionally, Phase II Study 102 crossover function data are likely in first-quarter 2022, making the next few quarters all about execution &ndash; encouragingly the company ended first quarter 2021 with around $1.7 billion in cash, equivalents, and investments, positioning SRPT well for these milestones.</p>\n<h2><strong>GSK&rsquo;s COVID-19 effort progresses, this time thanks to Medicago</strong></h2>\n<p>GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world&rsquo;s largest vaccine makers but absent from the first wave of COVID-19 jabs, confirmed this week that it has a chance of playing a role in the tail of the pandemic, commented Amy Brown on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>Two novel vaccines are now at the pivotal stage. The first is partnered with Sanofi and the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-ii-success-for-plant-based-vaccine-from-medicago-and-gsk\">second with Medicago</a>, with Glaxo providing the adjuvant for both. These projects are being developed with the market for booster shots in mind. High immune response after a single dose in patients with prior infection shows strong booster potential, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline said of their candidate. Canada&rsquo;s Medicago, which released Phase II data yesterday, pointed to strong neutralizing antibody responses and the potential for a potent, adjuvanted vaccine to provide cross-protection against emerging variants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>GSK also announced positive mid-stage results for its Sanofi-partnered COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In a Phase II trial, the immune responses generated by Sanofi/GSK&rsquo;s adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine were found to be in line with those measured in people who have recovered from COVID-19, the companies said in a statement. The interim results also showed 95-100% seroconversion following a second injection across all adult age groups in the trial and across all doses.</p>\n<h2><strong>Immutep: BMS shows LAG-3 &ndash; PD-1 combo boosts PFS in melanoma</strong></h2>\n<p>goetzpartners securities research analyst Chris Redhead commented on the implications of Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s recent news on its drug candidate relatlimab on Australian biotech Immutep. <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/asco-2021-bristol-myers-boasts-next-gen-checkpoint-blocker\">Bristol Myers announced that RELATIVITY-047</a> evaluating combination of its anti-LAG-3 relatlimab with Opdivo had a significant benefit on progression-free survival. The Phase II/III trial in patients with untreated or unresectable melanoma showed a PFS of 10.12 months with the relatlimab combo compared to 4.63 months with Opdivo alone. This is the first time a treatment regimen has shown benefit over PD-1 alone in melanoma.</p>\n<p>These data to be presented at ASCO (American Society for Clinical Oncology) meeting (June 2021) are clearly positive for Australian biotech firm Immutep's partnered anti-LAG-3 LAG525 currently in Phase II with Novartis. With Immutep's eftilagimod alpha (\"efti\") also showing positive bene\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ts in combination with PD-1 in HNSCC (head and neck cancer) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these new data highlight the potential of Immutep's in-house and partnered program. Additional new data from the TACTI-002 Phase II in HNSCC and NSCLC and TACTI-004 in solid tumors will be released during ASCO on June 4. With final AIPAC survival data also expected over the course of 2021E, goetzpartners reiterates its OUTPERFORM recommendation and A$0.900 target price, said Mr Redhead.</p>\n<p>LAG525 anti-LAG-3 in multiple trials with Novartis, out-licensed as IMP701 to CoStim Pharmaceuticals now owned by Novartis LAG525 is in five clinical trials encompassing both solid tumours, including mBC and melanoma, and blood cancers. These studies involve the use of a variety of drugs in combination with LAG525, including chemotherapy, immune-oncology biologics, and small molecules.</p>\n<h2><strong>Lilly&rsquo;s tirzepatide heads to the regulators</strong></h2>\n<p>Eli Lilly will submit its dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide to regulators by the end of 2021 after the project scored today in its <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lilly-closes-up-as-tirzepatide-compares-favorably-with-insulin-glargine\">fifth pivotal trial, Surpass-4</a>, commented Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>The study, in type 2 diabetes patients with increased cardiovascular risk, found tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine on HbA1c and weight loss. More importantly, it helped demonstrate tirzepatide&rsquo;s cardiovascular safety, a requirement for type 2 diabetes drugs. A meta-analysis of the Surpass program found a 19% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events with tirzepatide versus pooled comparator data; Surpass-4 accounted for the majority of these events.</p>\n<p>The go-to dose of tirzepatide will be 5mg, Lilly&rsquo;s chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, said during the group&rsquo;s first-quarter call, with the option to dose higher. If approved, tirzepatide will become the latest weapon in Lilly&rsquo;s battle with Novo Nordisk in diabetes; the Danish group ditched a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist and a glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP tri-agonist last year, citing toxicity concerns. Lilly has its own tri-agonist, &ldquo;triple G&rdquo;, which it has said could be even better than tirzepatide. Phase I data with this project, as well as results from Surpass-1, 2, 3 and 5, will feature at next month&rsquo;s ADA meeting.</p>", "date": "2021-05-23 10:49:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 21, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Saretpa Therapeutics, SRP-9001, GlaxoSmithKline, Medicago, Bristol Myers Squibb, Relatimab, Immutep, Eli Lilly, Tirzepatide", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to May 21, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-23 10:48:22", "updated": "2021-05-23 11:05:08", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-21-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Diabetes, Infectious diseases, Musculoskeletal, Oncology, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "ASCO, Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Immutep, Medicago, Sarepta Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "relatlimab, SRP-9001, tirzepatide", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-23 10:49:00"}
