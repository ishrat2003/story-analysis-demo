The integration events were distributed randomly across the genome, and there was no evidence of clonal expansion or any dominant integration event. Additionally, whole genome sequencing of the tumor confirmed that the patient had several genetic mutations that are characteristic of HCC and are independent of vector integration. Finally, gene expression analysis of the tumor and adjacent tissue suggested a precancerous state in the liver consistent with several risk factors that predispose this patient to HCC.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follows FDA clinical hold in December</strong></h2>\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration placed a <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clinical-hold-on-uniqure-s-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-program\">clinical hold on uniQure&rsquo;s hemophilia B program</a> following the submission of a safety report in mid-December 2020 of a possibly related serious adverse event associated with a preliminary diagnosis of HCC in one patient in the HOPE-B trial. The patient has multiple risk factors associated with HCC, including a twenty-five-year history of hepatitis C (HCV), history of hepatitis B (HBV), evidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, history of smoking, familial history of cancer and advanced age. Chronic infections with hepatitis B and C have been associated with approximately 80% of HCC cases.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><em>Data from investigation was submitted to the FDA on March 26, 2021 ~</em></p>\n<p>Dr David Lillicrap, Professor of the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen&rsquo;s University, Kingston, Canada, stated: &ldquo;The investigations that have been performed have shown no evidence to suggest that the AAV vector delivered in the HOPE-B study has played a pathogenic role in the hepatocellular cancer that has now been diagnosed in the patient,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The external lab analyzed more than 220,000 cells from the tissue sample and identified 60 cells with random integration events that have no known association with the development of HCC,&rdquo; stated Ricardo Dolmetsch, president of R&amp;D at uniQure. &ldquo;Moreover, whole genome sequencing of the tumor showed that this patient had large abnormalities on chromosomes 1 and 8 that are commonly associated with HCC, as well as mutation of TP53 and several other potentially oncogenic genes,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Taken together, the findings from this investigation strongly suggest that etranacogene dezaparvovec did not contribute to this case of HCC,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We have now shared these data with the FDA and are prepared to have further communications regarding the status of the clinical hold in the second quarter of 2021. We also expect to submit the data for presentation at an upcoming industry conference yet to be determined.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Based on the results from this very thorough investigation involving an independent lab and several expert reviews, we believe it is very unlikely that etranacogene dezaparvovec is related to the HCC event in the HOPE-B study,&rdquo; stated Matt Kapusta, chief executive of uniQure. &ldquo;Patient safety will always be our top priority, and we are prepared to discuss with the FDA the recently submitted analyses and the status of the clinical hold as expeditiously as possible. As stated previously, we do not anticipate any impact to the HOPE-B pivotal study or our regulatory submission timeline as a result of the clinical hold,&rdquo; he added.</p>", "date": "2021-03-29 14:51:00", "meta_title": "New uniQure findings likely to diffuse hemophilia B gene therapy scare", "meta_keywords": "uniQure, Etranacogene dezaparvovec, HOPE-B trial, Investigation, HCC, FDA, Clinical hold, Hemophilia B", "meta_description": "New uniQure findings likely to diffuse hemophilia B gene therapy scare", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-29 14:51:03", "updated": "2021-03-29 14:57:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-uniqure-findings-likely-to-diffuse-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-scare", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "uniqure_hq_big.jpg", "image2id": "uniqure_hq_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Netherlands, USA", "company_tag": "uniQure", "drug_tag": "etranacogene dezaparvovec", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-29 14:51:00"}
