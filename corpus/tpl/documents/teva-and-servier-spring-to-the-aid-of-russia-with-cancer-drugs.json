In recent months, the company has almost completely suspended its supplies to the domestic market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As some Russian media reported, citing the company, the main reason for interruption of supplies is the change in production technology.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, representatives of the Russian Ministry of Health said there is currently no shortage of the drug in the local market due to the presence of its another analogue - vincristine-RONC, which is produced by the Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is despite the fact that most of local oncologists consider the drug inconvenient for treating children, since the form of release does not allow accurate dosage the drug, which leads to increase of toxicity of therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the ways to solve the problem is the beginning of procurements of another generic from Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA).&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Teva set to supply vincristine-teva</strong></h2>\n<p>In a letter the Israeli company has recently notified the resumption of supplies of vincristine-teva starting from April. The drug disappeared from the Russian market in 2019, as deliveries under state contracts for the company became impossible due to the &ldquo;extra third&rdquo; rule. Another reason for the suspension of supplies was the low maximum selling price for vincristine, fixed by the Ministry of Health back in 2010.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, in addition to vincristine, there is a high possibility of a shortage of some other drugs used for the treatment of blood cancer in children. An example is Oncaspar (pegaspargase), which lost its Russian registration in 2019 due to the transfer of rights to it by the French drugmaker Servier. In 2020, after complaints from patients and doctors, 1,500 bottles of the drug were purchased. However, further purchases are in question.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Servier to register Oncospar</strong></h2>\n<p>A spokesman of Servier told the Russian Kommersant business paper that it intends to register Oncaspar under the new EAEU regulations, specifying that in March 2020 it submitted the corresponding dossier to the Ministry of Health.</p>\n<p>The problems with vincristine and Oncaspar still exist, despite last years&rsquo; decision by the Russian government to organize imports of number of vital drugs into the country on the basis of a procedure for unregistered drugs. This mechanism allows the authorities to allocate funds for a single operator &ndash; the Federal State Unitary Enterprise \"Moscow Endocrine Plant,\" which directly purchases drugs from foreign manufacturers for the Russian market.</p>", "date": "2021-03-23 12:04:00", "meta_title": "Teva and Servier spring to the aid of Russia with cancer drugs", "meta_keywords": "Blood cancer, Pediatric, Shortages, Supply, Interuptions, Veropharm, Vincristine, Teva Pharmaceuticals.
