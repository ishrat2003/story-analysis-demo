The drug showed significant improvements to the signs and symptoms of RA patients compared to those in the placebo and methotrexate group, not only in biologically na&iuml;ve patients, but also among the difficult to treat population with active RA inadequately controlled by TNF-&alpha; inhibitor therapy.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Belgium&rsquo;s leading pharma company UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) granted a world-wide exclusive license to R-Pharm for olokizumab, based on an undisclosed upfront payment from the Russian drugmaker, and entitlement to receive payments on development and commercialization milestones and royalties.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 2020, we successfully completed the Phase III clinical program, so we are delighted to share at the conference with the medical community data from two key registrational trials. Having invested over seven years in ensuring the proven efficacy and safety of olokizumab, we are now approaching preparations for global filing: to address the medical needs of patients with RA,\" commented R-Pharm chief medical officer Mikhail Samsonov.</p>\n<h2><strong>European and US regulatory filings planned</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on the findings, R-Pharm says it will seek marketing authorization of olokizumab in Europe and the USA.</p>\n<p>Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine. It targets the IL-6 ligand rather than the receptor, and selectively blocks the final assembly of the signalling complex. It is the first direct inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) authorized for commercial use for this indication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on the results of CREDO 3, Russia&rsquo;s Ministry of Health approved a new indication to be included in the Artlegia (olokizumab) SmPC. Now the medication is approved, in combination with methotrexate, for adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in case of insufficient efficacy of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, in addition to initial indication of RA treatment after methotrexate failure.</p>\n<p>R-Pharm is currently establishing GMP-certified olokizumab production at facilities in France and Germany to enable prompt approval of the drug in the American and European markets.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-20 14:53:00", "meta_title": "R-Pharm reports positive new data on RA drug olokizumab", "meta_keywords": "R-Pharm, Olokizumab, Artlegia, Phase III, Rheumatoid arthritis, Regulatory filings", "meta_description": "R-Pharm reports positive new data on RA drug olokizumab", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-20 14:52:14", "updated": "2021-05-20 14:59:03", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/r-pharm-reports-positive-new-data-on-ra-drug-olokizumab", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "r-pharmusbig.png", "image2id": "r-pharmussmall.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "R-Pharm, UCB", "drug_tag": "Artlegia, olokizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-20 14:53:00"}
