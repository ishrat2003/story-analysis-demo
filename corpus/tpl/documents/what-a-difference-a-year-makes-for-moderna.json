Like other novel coronavirus vaccine developers, Moderna has striven to hit ambitious production targets from a standing start.</p>\n<p>However, boosted by the distribution of over 100 million doses of mRNA-1273, the firm&rsquo;s first commercial product, net income was $1.2 billion for the three-month period.</p>\n<p>That compares with a net loss of $124 million for the same quarter in 2020 and translates to an earnings per share (EPS) figure of $3.05 - up from a 35 cent loss per share.</p>\n<p>Chief executive St&eacute;phane Bancel noted that the company&rsquo;s first ever profitable quarter was based on &ldquo;10 years of scientific innovation and several billion dollars invested to make our mRNA platform a reality.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Coronavirus vaccine</h2>\n<p>Understandably, much of the focus in the first quarter for Moderna has been on output of its coronavirus vaccine, mRNA-1273, which is now forecast to reach between 800 million and 1 billion doses in 2021.</p>\n<p>The Cambridge, USA-based company has said it will make additional investments to increase global supply up to three billion doses in 2022.</p>\n<p>Mr Bancel said Moderna was &ldquo;now actively engaged in discussions and agreements for 2022 with all of the governments we are currently supplying for 2021.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added: &ldquo;On top of that, new partnerships, like COVAX, for up to 466 million doses in 2022 and discussions with new governments in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, make us believe that our total advance purchase agreements for 2022 should be higher than those in 2021.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With rising concern about the potential for new vaccine-beating variants of the novel coronavirus to emerge, Moderna is also developing versions of its vaccine against such threats.</p>\n<p>New data shows a single booster dose of mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351 increased neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 and two variants of concern in previously vaccinated trial participants.</p>\n<p>The company is also testing the vaccine in younger and more vulnerable demographics, in order to extend access in the population.</p>\n<h2>Broader research efforts</h2>\n<p>While the messenger RNA (mRNA) specialist has attracted global headlines due to the success of its coronavirus vaccine program, Moderna has a wide range of candidates in its portfolio, 14 of which are in clinical studies.</p>\n<p>With a 24 candidate-strong R&amp;D program covering infectious diseases and rare diseases, one highlight from the first quarter was positive seven-month interim data from a Phase II study of cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate mRNA-1647.</p>\n<p>The firm also announced positive interim data from a Phase I study of RSV vaccine candidate mRNA-1345 in younger adults.</p>", "date": "2021-05-06 17:10:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "vaccine, Moderna, coronavirus, quarter, million, billion, mRNA-, increase, doses, difference, year, impact, fiscal, level, clear, revenue, successful, shar", "meta_description": "A 23,650% first quarter revenue increase makes clear the level of fiscal impact a successful coronavirus vaccine can have.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-06 17:09:26", "updated": "2021-05-06 21:26:41", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/what-a-difference-a-year-makes-for-moderna", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "moderna_big.jpg", "image2id": "moderna_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Rare diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Financial, Focus On, Management", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Moderna", "drug_tag": "mRNA-1273, mRNA-1345", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-06 17:10:00"}
