{"contentid": 488681, "importid": NaN, "name": "ASCO 2021: Bristol Myers boasts next-gen checkpoint blocker", "introduction": "At this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ASCO meeting, Bristol Myers Squibb will present the first data from a Phase III trial evaluating a LAG-3-blocking antibody.", "content": "<p>At this year&rsquo;s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) will present the first data from a Phase III trial evaluating a LAG-3-blocking antibody.</p>\n<p>The firm has already released top-line results from the RELATIVITY-047 trial, revealing a fixed-dose combination of LAG-3 blocker relatlimab and Opdivo (nivolumab) met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), in the first-line treatment of melanoma.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Cheng, senior vice president and head of oncology development, describes relatlimab as &ldquo;a very exciting new area,&rdquo; adding it is now &ldquo;the third checkpoint inhibitor to show benefit in patients with melanoma.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Until now, the company has not revealed the degree of benefit over treatment with Opdivo alone - already an effective option for people with this type of cancer.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullQuote\">\"Relatlimab is now the third checkpoint inhibitor to show benefit in patients with melanoma.\"</span></p>\n<p>In an oral presentation at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the firm will show that a median PFS of 10.12 months was achieved for the test arm, compared with 4.63 months in those who received Opdivo alone.</p>\n<p>In addition, exploratory, descriptive analyses show the combination extended PFS regardless of pre-specified subgroups and stratification factors.</p>\n<p>While the results appear to be slightly below those offered by a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy (ipilimumab), as shown in the Checkmate-067 study, there seems to be a significant safety advantage which could make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Severe adverse events reached 19% for the LAG-3-blocking combo, around a third of the figure for the Yervoy-based combination.</p>\n<p>As a fixed-dose combination, the product Bristol Myers is developing is also simple to administer, with a reduced risk of dosing error.</p>\n<h2>LAG-3 inhibition</h2>\n<p>Described as the &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; of checkpoint blocker, LAG-3 inhibition is a novel approach which Bristol Myers hopes will unlock the ability to bolster the immune response in a new way, while preventing resistance.</p>\n<p>Dr Cheng tells The Pharma Letter: &ldquo;I think this is an important advancement for patients that have melanoma, showing that they can receive, with a dual I/O combination, better clinical benefit and results compared to just a single agent PD1 inhibitor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By suppressing T-cell activation and cytokine secretion, relatlimab offers a unique mechanism of action which appears to be synergistic with traditional immunotherapies targeting PD-1.</p>\n<h2>Commercial development</h2>\n<p>We will have to wait longer for the more important endpoint of overall survival (OS), but the results are highly encouraging for the New York-based firm, which appears to be going from strength to strength following the $74 billion acquisition of Celgene.</p>\n<p>Given the predominance of Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) PD-1 targeting superstar Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in so many areas of immuno-oncology, the lead Bristol Myers appears to be developing in LAG-3 inhibition could be important.</p>\n<p>While Merck is also working on a LAG-3 blocker, MK-4280 or favezelimab, which it is combining with Keytruda, the company is yet to present late stage data on its performance.</p>\n<p>The firm is presenting its first sets of in-human data at ASCO, showing an overall response rate (ORR) of only 6%, with a single complete remission, in a small number of people with colorectal cancer.</p>\n<p>It is still early days, but the data boasted by Bristol Myers could show the direction of travel and the potential for the firm&rsquo;s leadership from this point.</p>\n<p>Asked about the likely next steps in terms of registration, Dr Cheng remains coy, stating: &ldquo;We tend not to discuss regulatory options,&rdquo; while adding &ldquo;we do want to recognize that progression-free survival is an accepted endpoint from regulatory perspective, so we look forward to those discussions.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-20 10:56:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Bristol, Myers, ASCO, checkpoint, combination, show, blocker, data, melanoma, relatlimab, benefit, LAG-, Opdivo, trial, meeting, LAG-blocking, results, fir", "meta_description": "At this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ASCO meeting, Bristol Myers Squibb will present the first data from a Phase III trial evaluating a LAG-3-blocking antibody.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-20 10:56:24", "updated": "2021-05-20 11:58:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/asco-2021-bristol-myers-boasts-next-gen-checkpoint-blocker", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biotech_lab_big.jpg", "image2id": "biotech_lab_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "ASCO, Conferences, In Depth, Interviews", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene", "drug_tag": "favezelimab, Opdivo, relatlimab, Yervoy", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-20 10:56:00"}
