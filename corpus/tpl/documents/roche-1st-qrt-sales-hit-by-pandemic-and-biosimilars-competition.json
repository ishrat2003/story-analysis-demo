As expected, the first quarter of 2021 was particularly challenging due to base effects, as the pandemic only started to have a significant business impact at Roche as of April 2020.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Diagnostics Division</strong> reported very strong sales growth of 55% to 4.3 billion francs, mainly due to Roche&rsquo;s comprehensive and growing portfolio of COVID-19 tests. The Point of Care and Molecular Lab businesses made the largest contributions (+281% and +86%, respectively) with COVID-19 testing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Product performances</strong></h2>\n<p>On the positive side, the pharma business was lifted by rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra (tocilizumab), repurposed for COVID-19 pneumonia, revenues from which rose 22% to 779 million francs, as well as an anti-COVID-19 antibody cocktail -a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab - it has partnered on with Regeneron (Nasdaq: REGN) that reaped sales 166 million francs.</p>\n<p>Negative performance due to biosimilars was seen for breast cancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab), with sales down 35% at 755 million francs, and MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab), for forms of blood cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and certain types of vasculitis, which fell 46% to 705 million.</p>\n<p>The new medicines (launched since 2012) grew by 20% (or +880 million francs) and generated sales of 5.2 billion francs. Overall, demand continued to grow encouragingly, though here too the impact of the lower number of doctor&rsquo;s visits was clearly noticeable, said Roche.</p>\n<p>Among the recently-launched drugs, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), for relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (first approved in 2017), generated first-quarter sales 1.2 billion francs (+16%);</p>\n<p>Perjeta (pertuzumab), for HER2-positive breast cancer (first approved in 2012), reported revenues of 988 million francs (+2%);</p>\n<p>Tecentriq (atezolizumab), for various types of cancer (first approved in 2016), sales were 775 million francs (+26%);</p>\n<p>Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh), for hemophilia A, (first approved in 2017), posted revenues of 661 million francs (+33%).</p>\n<h2><strong>Outlook for 2021 confirmed</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the continued strong impact of biosimilars, sales are expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digit range, at constant exchange rates. Core earnings per share are targeted to grow broadly in line with sales, at constant exchange rates. Roche expects to increase its dividend in Swiss francs further.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the Group&rsquo;s performance in the first quarter, Roche chief executive Severin Schwan said: &ldquo;In 2021, Roche remains strongly committed to the fight against COVID-19. The uptake of our recently introduced diagnostic tests and medicines remains strong, while we continue to see the expected impact from biosimilars on sales of our established medicines. Our broad product pipeline keeps making good progress. I am particularly pleased about the highly encouraging study results of our immunotherapy Tecentriq [atezolizumab] in early lung cancer and of faricimab in ophthalmology. The upcoming acquisition of GenMark underlines our commitment to help control infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Based on the results of the first quarter of 2021, we confirm the outlook for the full year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-21 12:27:00", "meta_title": "Roche 1st-qrt sales hit by pandemic and biosimilars competition", "meta_keywords": "Roche, Financial results, 1st-qrt, 2021, Sales", "meta_description": "Roche 1st-qrt sales hit by pandemic and biosimilars competition", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-21 12:25:54", "updated": "2021-04-21 12:36:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roche-1st-qrt-sales-hit-by-pandemic-and-biosimilars-competition", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "roche_night_large.jpg", "image2id": "roche_night_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Infectious diseases, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Financial, Focus On", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Roche", "drug_tag": "Actemra/RoActemra, Hemlibra, Ocrevus, Perjeta, Tecentriq", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-21 12:27:00"}
