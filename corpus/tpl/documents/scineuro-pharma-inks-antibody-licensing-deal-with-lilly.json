There is a pressing need for new therapeutic options. We are pleased to be collaborating with SciNeuro, a company dedicated to the treatment of serious neurological diseases and focused on development within Greater China, to help address such needs,&rdquo; said Michael Hutton, vice president, neurodegeneration research, at Lilly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are excited to establish this important collaboration with Lilly, an industry leader in neurological diseases. Alpha-synuclein is a promising target for neurodegenerative disease with robust evidence of human genetics and disease pathology, and it aligns well with SciNeuro&rsquo;s strategic focus. Current therapies for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease provide symptomatic relief, while alpha-synuclein targeted therapies, particularly given the differentiated features of the Lilly program, have the potential to slow or halt disease progression. They hold significant promise as a new treatment paradigm to improve the quality of life and management of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients,&rdquo; said Min Li, founder, president and chief executive of SciNeuro.</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 11:33:00", "meta_title": "SciNeuro Pharma inks antibody licensing deal with Lilly", "meta_keywords": "Eli Lily, ScieNeuro Pharmaceuticals, License, Agreement, Antibody therapies, Parkinson's disease, Greater China", "meta_description": "SciNeuro Pharma inks antibody licensing deal with Lilly", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 11:32:41", "updated": "2021-04-15 11:39:25", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/scineuro-pharma-inks-antibody-licensing-deal-with-lilly", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "eli_lilly_hq_large.jpg", "image2id": "eli_lilly_hq_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "China, Taiwan, USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, SciNeuro Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 11:33:00"}
