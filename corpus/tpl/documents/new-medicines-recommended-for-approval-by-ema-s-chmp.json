AQP4-IgG are present in around 70%-80% of people with NMOSD, who tend to experience a more severe disease course.</p>\n<p>NMOSD is a rare and life-threatening condition and most commonly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. This disorder can lead to reduction or loss of vision, loss of sensation, loss of bowel and bladder control, weakness and paralysis of the arms and legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Evkeeza</strong> (evinacumab), from US biotech <strong>Regeneron</strong> (Nasdaq: REGN), was granted a positive opinion by the Committee for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Evkeeza was reviewed under EMA&rsquo;s accelerated assessment programme.</p>\n<p>The Committee recommended granting a marketing authorization for Danish drugmaker <strong>LEO Pharma&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>Adtralza</strong> (tralokinumab), for the treatment&nbsp;of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Koselugo</strong> (selumetinib), from the UK&rsquo;s <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> (LSE: AZN), was granted a positive opinion for the treatment of pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PN).</p>\n<p>The Committee adopted a positive opinion for<strong> Onureg</strong> (azacitidine), from US major <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb</strong> (NYSE: BMY), for the maintenance treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. If approved, Onureg will become the first and only once daily oral frontline maintenance therapy in Europe for patients with a broad range of AML subtypes, says major Bristol Myers.</p>\n<p><strong>Generic and hybrid drug opinions</strong></p>\n<p>The CHMP recommended granting marketing authorizations for two generic medicines: <strong>Abiraterone Krka </strong>(abiraterone acetate), from KRKA, for the treatment of adult men with metastatic prostate cancer and <strong>Celsunax</strong> (ioflupane (<sup>123</sup>I)), from <strong>Pinax Pharma</strong>, intended for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum.</p>\n<p>The Committee recommended granting a marketing authorization for <strong>Nova Laboratories&rsquo;</strong> hybrid medicine <strong>Jayempi</strong> (azathioprine) intended for prophylaxis against transplant rejection and as immunosuppressive antimetabolite either alone or in combination with other agents to influence the immune response in a variety of diseases. Hybrid applications rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials of an already authorized reference product and in part on new data.</p>\n<p>Image: ema_building-credit_rob_acket.</p>", "date": "2021-04-23 16:24:00", "meta_title": "New medicines recommended for approval by EMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CHMP", "meta_keywords": "EMA, CHMP, Recommendations, Roche, Enspryng, Regeneron, Evkeeza, LEO Pharma, Adtralza, AstraZeneca, Koselugo, Bristol Myers, Onureg, Nova Labs, Jayempi", "meta_description": "New medicines recommended for approval by EMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CHMP", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-23 16:23:23", "updated": "2021-04-23 16:45:56", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-medicines-recommended-for-approval-by-ema-s-chmp", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket.jpg", "image2id": "ema_building-credit_rob_acket_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cardio-vascular, Dermatologicals, Immunologicals, Neurological, Ophthalmics, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, LEO Pharma, Nova Laboratories, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche", "drug_tag": "Adtralza, Enspryng, Evkeeza, Jayempi, Koselugo, Onureg", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-23 16:24:00"}
