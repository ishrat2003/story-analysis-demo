In parallel, Medicago has also initiated a feasibility study of a vaccine candidate to address the emerging COVID-19 variants.</p>\n<p>Under a deal between the companies announced last July, the candidate vaccine combines Medicago's recombinant coronavirus virus-like particles (CoVLP) with GSK's pandemic adjuvant system.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>One step closer to an important new COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to take the significant step of initiating the Phase III clinical trial at sites around the world,&rdquo; said Takashi Nagao, chief executive and president of Medicago, a subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. &ldquo;This brings us one step closer to delivering an important new COVID-19 vaccine and contributing to the global fight against the pandemic along with our partner GSK,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer, GSK Vaccines, said: &ldquo;This advance to late-stage clinical testing further reinforces our confidence in the adjuvanted vaccine candidate&rsquo;s potential to make a difference in the continued fight against COVID-19. We look forward to sharing results later this year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Medicago&rsquo;s plant-derived vaccine candidate against COVID-19 uses Coronavirus-Like-Particle (CoVLP) technology with the vaccine composed of recombinant spike (S) glycoprotein expressed as virus-like-particles (VLPs) co-administered with GSK&rsquo;s pandemic adjuvant. Two doses of 3.75 micrograms of CoVLP are administered 21 days apart.</p>\n<p>The vaccine candidate, in combination with the pandemic adjuvant, was granted Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 17, 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>GSK also working with Sanofi</strong></h2>\n<p>Following an earlier setback in their collaboration on an adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine program last December, France&rsquo;s Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) and GSK last month announced the initiation of a new Phase II study with 720 volunteers aged 18 and over to select the most appropriate antigen dosage for Phase III evaluation of their adjuvanted recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine candidate.</p>", "date": "2021-03-16 12:07:00", "meta_title": "Medicago and GSK launch Phase III trial of adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_keywords": "Medicago, GlaxoSmithKline, Phase III, Adjuvanted, COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_description": "Medicago and GSK launch Phase III trial of adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-16 12:06:05", "updated": "2021-03-16 12:55:22", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/medicago-and-gsk-launch-phase-iii-trial-of-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-candidate", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "medicago_north_carolina_large.jpg", "image2id": "medicago_north_carolina_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Canada, Japan, UK", "company_tag": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicago, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma", "drug_tag": "COVID-19", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-16 12:07:00"}
