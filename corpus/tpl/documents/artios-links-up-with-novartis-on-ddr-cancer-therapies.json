We are thrilled to work with Novartis, and this combined with our recent collaboration with Merck KGaA, provides important validation of the power of the internal discovery capabilities at Artios. From a strategic perspective, this collaboration is an ideal fit which maximizes the application of our platform to areas beyond our current focus as we independently advance our pipeline of novel DDR candidates,&rdquo; commented Artios&rsquo; chief executive Dr Niall Martin.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We look forward to continued momentum as a clinical-stage precision medicine company, building upon our recently initiated Phase I study of ART0380, our potential best-in-class ATR inhibitor, with the expected entry of our first-in-class Pol Theta program into the clinic before year end,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Terms of the collaboration</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the terms of the deal, Novartis will make an up-front payment of $20 million and provide near term research funding to support the collaboration. Artios will be eligible to receive discovery, development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, in addition to royalty payments on net sales of products commercialized by Novartis. The collaboration does not include Artios&rsquo; lead programs, ART0380, which is currently in clinical development, or ART4215, a first-in-class Pol Theta inhibitor.</p>\n<p>Novartis&rsquo; RLT delivers targeted radiation to a specific subset of cancer cells, with minimal effect on surrounding healthy cells. RLT has been shown to improve overall survival and quality of life, particularly in the setting of cancers with bone metastases.</p>", "date": "2021-04-07 12:12:00", "meta_title": "Artios links up with Novartis on DDR cancer therapies", "meta_keywords": "Artios Pharma, Novartis, DDR, Cancer therapies, ART0380, ART4215, Collaboration, Research", "meta_description": "Artios links up with Novartis on DDR cancer therapies", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-07 12:10:28", "updated": "2021-04-07 12:20:04", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/artios-links-up-with-novartis-on-ddr-cancer-therapies", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "artios_large.png", "image2id": "artios_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, UK", "company_tag": "Artios Pharma, Novartis", "drug_tag": "ART0380, ART4215", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-07 12:12:00"}
