Exon-skipping and dystrophin production in the 30mg/kg cohort were also consistently higher than the 20mg/kg cohort of MOMENTUM.</p>\n<h2><strong>Adverse event reported, but seen as manageable</strong></h2>\n<p>On the negative side, hypomagnesemia was identified in patients taking SRP-5051. Reduced magnesium levels, which can lead to heart damage and seizures, were observed in two of the four patients Sarepta reported data from. Executives said the side effect went away after the patients received oral magnesium, and believe that such supplements can keep the condition from occurring in the future.</p>\n<p>RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote that the side effect is \"potentially manageable in [the] context of severe disease but may garner increased regulatory scrutiny.\"</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to report strong, dose-dependent exon-skipping and dystrophin expression results with monthly dosing of SRP-5051 &ndash; in ambulant and non-ambulant patients. Even at an early timepoint of 12 weeks and after as few as only three doses, these data confirm the potential of Sarepta&rsquo;s next-generation PPMO platform to be a step order improvement over our current PMO platform, and to profoundly impact the course of Duchenne. While we saw exceptional expression after only a few initial doses, our models predict that we will exceed dystrophin expression levels of 10% of normal or greater over time with SRP-5051,&rdquo; said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta.</p>\n<p>He continued: &ldquo;We are excited to have chosen our target dose for further development. Part A of MOMENTUM is now complete and Sarepta will work with great urgency to discuss the results with regulatory agencies and gain their insights, including the development path to support an accelerated approval of SRP-5051 in the United States.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sarepta already holds leadership positions in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs), with approved RNA therapies, Exondys (eteplirsen), Vyondys 53 (golodirsen)], and Amondys 45 (casimersen) injection, and notes that it currently has more than 40 programs in various stages of development.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 12:39:00", "meta_title": "Sarepta leaps on mainly positive SRP-5051 results in patients with DMD", "meta_keywords": "Sarepta Therapeutics, SRP-5051, DMD, Duchenne, Muscular dystrophy, Phase II", "meta_description": "Sarepta leaps on mainly positive SRP-5051 results in patients with DMD", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-04 12:38:16", "updated": "2021-05-04 12:47:10", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sarepta-leaps-on-positive-srp-5051-results-in-patients-with-dmd", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sarepta-big.jpg", "image2id": "sarepta-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Muscular dystrophy", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Sarepta Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "Duchenne, SRP-5051", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 12:39:00"}
