There is currently no approved drug treatment for CMT1A.</p>\n<p>In January 2020, the company reported interim results suggesting sustained safety and efficacy of PXT3003 in patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A after 24 months of total trial time (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU Period 1 trials). The new results announced today continue to show sustained treatment benefits for CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 at High Dose (HD) in the PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2 trial with a data readout at 54 months of total trial time (double-blind + open-label).</p>\n<p>Market reaction was negative, as Pharnext&rsquo;s shares closed down 3.3% at 3.24 euros following the announcement.</p>\n<h2><strong>Highlights from an analysis of available data include:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>PXT3003 was safe and well tolerated. Data are consistent with observed safety profile in prior clinical trials.</li>\n<li>Data on the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS), which measures patients&rsquo; functional motor disability, are as follows (please refer to the diagram below for graphical illustration):</li>\n<ul>\n<li>During PLEO-CMT (double-blind Phase III study), patients treated with placebo on average declined on ONLS while patients treated with PXT3003 on average improved. The best efficacy signal was observed in the cohort of patients treated with PXT3003 HD.</li>\n<li>During PLEO-CMT-FU (open-label Phase III Extension study), on average patients improved on ONLS across all patient cohorts.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Patients treated with placebo declined on ONLS during the double-blind phase, but then improved when switched to PXT3003 in the ongoing open-label phase.</li>\n<li>Patients treated with PXT3003 during the double-blind phase continue to improve when pursuing their treatment with PXT3003 in the ongoing open-label phase.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>New results with available ONLS data after 54 months of total trial time suggest a better efficacy signal with PXT3003 HD in this patient population.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Although these new data were generated from an open-label study, the findings are consistent with the safety and efficacy results&nbsp;of PXT3003 observed in&nbsp;prior clinical studies in CMT1A. In addition, the fact we have just initiated the PREMIER trial&nbsp;in&nbsp;a similar patient population, using&nbsp;the same High&nbsp;Dose of PXT3003 and measuring the same efficacy endpoint ONLS, reinforces our confidence&nbsp;in the potential positive outcome of our ongoing pivotal Phase III study,&rdquo; commented Pharnext&rsquo;s chief medical officer Adrian Hepner.</p>", "date": "2021-04-29 11:10:00", "meta_title": "Pharnext updates on PXT3003 for patients with CMT1APharnext updates on", "meta_keywords": "Pharnext, PXT3003, CMT1A, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Phase III", "meta_description": "Pharnext updates on PXT3003 for patients with CMT1A", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-29 11:09:48", "updated": "2021-04-29 23:25:13", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pharnext-updates-on-pxt3003-for-patients-with-cmt1a", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "pharnext-large.jpg", "image2id": "pharnext-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Neurological, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "France", "company_tag": "Pharnext", "drug_tag": "PXT3003", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-29 11:10:00"}
