Futibatinib is an investigational therapy and has not been approved by any regulatory authority for use in patients.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, US biotech Incyte (Nasdaq: INCY) won US approval for Pemazyre (pemigatinib), as a second-line option for certain people with locally-advanced or metastatic bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, making it the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for this indication. Incyte added European approval for its drug earlier this month.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Patients living with locally advanced and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, currently have a poor prognosis, particularly since there is no standard treatment after the failure of first-line chemotherapy,&rdquo; said Dr Martin Birkhofer, senior vice president and chief medical officer, Taiho Oncology</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Inc. &ldquo;We are pleased that the FDA has recognized the potential benefit of futibatinib in previously treated CCA patients. We look forward to continued dialogue with FDA and other Health Authorities as we work toward global availability of futibatinib for cholangiocarcinoma patients,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>The decision by FDA to grant this designation is based on efficacy and safety results from the Phase II FOENIX-CCA2 study, which will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2021, taking place April 9-14, 2021.</p>\n<p>The FDA states that Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for BTD require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.</p>\n<p>In May 2018, the FDA Office of Orphan Drug Development granted futibatinib orphan drug status for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.</p>", "date": "2021-04-02 12:16:00", "meta_title": "FDA \u00e2\u0080\u0098Breakthrough\u00e2\u0080\u0099 status for Taiho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s futibatinib", "meta_keywords": "Taiho, Otsuka, Futibatinib, TAS-120, Cholangiocarcinoma, Cancer, Bile duct, FDA, Breakthrough, Designation", "meta_description": "FDA \u00e2\u0080\u0098Breakthrough\u00e2\u0080\u0099 status for Taiho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s futibatinib", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-02 12:15:07", "updated": "2021-04-02 12:24:28", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-breakthrough-status-for-taiho-s-futibatinib", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "taiho-big.png", "image2id": "taiho-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Otsuka, Taiho Oncology, Taiho Pharmaceutical", "drug_tag": "futibatinib, TAS-120", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-02 12:16:00"}
