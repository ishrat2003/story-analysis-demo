An anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda is by far Merck&rsquo;s biggest-selling drug, generated sales of $14.4 billion last year.</p>\n<p>The application was based on pCR data and early interim event-free survival (EFS) findings from the Phase III KEYNOTE-522 trial, which is continuing to evaluate for EFS. Ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the application, the FDA&rsquo;s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 10-0 that a regulatory decision should be deferred until further data are available from KEYNOTE-522. The next interim analysis is calendar-driven and will occur in the third quarter of 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>Backing data seen as &ldquo;questionable&rdquo; by FDA</strong></h2>\n<p>Keytruda&rsquo;s chances as a monotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer were always a longshot after the FDA offered a stinging rebuke of the drug&rsquo;s pivotal dataset, which it called &ldquo;questionable&rdquo; given immature overall survival data and some wishy-washy efficacy numbers, according to ODAC briefing documents at the time, noted Kyle Blankenship, writing on EndPoints News.</p>\n<p>However, a spekesperson for Merck clarified that&nbsp;the study design of KEYNOTE-522 tested Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant (pre-operative) treatment, then as a single agent as adjuvant (post-operative treatment) after surgery.</p>\n<p>This CRL does not impact any current approved indications for Keytruda, including the indication for the drug in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] &ge;10), as determined by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.</p>", "date": "2021-03-30 14:11:00", "meta_title": "Setback for Merck, which gets CRL for Keytruda sBLA", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, Keytruda, Breast cancer, Triple-negative, FDA, Complete response letter, CRL", "meta_description": "Setback for Merck, which gets CRL for Keytruda sBLA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-30 14:09:56", "updated": "2021-03-31 14:33:03", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/setback-for-merck-which-gets-crl-for-keytruda-sbla", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "keytruda_large-1--1.jpg", "image2id": "keytruda_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co", "drug_tag": "Keytruda", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-30 14:11:00"}
