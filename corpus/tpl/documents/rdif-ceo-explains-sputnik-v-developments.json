Currently there are additional talks ongoing to boost production in the European Union. This will allow to start supplying Sputnik V to the European single market once the approval is granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are now actively working with EMA as part of the rolling review procedure. In addition, RDIF and partners are ready to start supplies to those EU countries that independently authorize Sputnik V,&rdquo; said Mr Dmitriev.</p>\n<h2><strong>Ahead of all European countries in two-jab rollout</strong></h2>\n<p>In a separate statement today, Mr Dmitriev noted that &ldquo;Russia is leading in Europe by the number of full vaccination courses against the coronavirus infection completed. Already 3.5 million people received both doses of Sputnik V.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>No other European country has yet fully vaccinated 3 million people. Great Britain, which is often mentioned as an example of quick vaccination, has given both vaccine doses to less than half the number of people than in Russia, he claimed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Together with China, the US, India and Israel Russia is in the top five globally in terms of the number people that got fully vaccinated. This indicator is often incorrectly compared to a total number of shots administered, whereas Russia uses a more conservative method based on full vaccination with two components,&rdquo; he explained.</p>", "date": "2021-03-15 10:47:00", "meta_title": "RDIF CEO explains Sputnik V developments", "meta_keywords": "Sputnik V, Partnering, Negotiations, Rollout, Courses, Vaccination, COVID-19, RDIF", "meta_description": "RDIF CEO explains Sputnik V developments", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-15 10:46:21", "updated": "2021-03-15 10:53:49", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rdif-ceo-explains-sputnik-v-developments", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vaccine_sputnik_big.jpg", "image2id": "vaccine_sputnik_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Russian Direct Investment Fund", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Markets & Marketing, Public health, Regulation, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Europe, Russia", "company_tag": "RDIF", "drug_tag": "Sputnik V", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": "Kirill Dmitriev", "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-15 10:47:00"}
