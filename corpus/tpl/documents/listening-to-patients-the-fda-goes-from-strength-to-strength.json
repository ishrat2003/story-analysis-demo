{"contentid": 488366, "importid": NaN, "name": "Listening to patients: The FDA goes from strength to strength", "introduction": "In seeking guidance on how to improve the regulatory process to enable access to much-needed treatments, who better to listen to than patients and caregivers?", "content": "<p>In seeking guidance on how to improve the regulatory process to enable access to much-needed treatments, who better to listen to than patients and caregivers? They are the stakeholders with the greatest understanding of which therapeutic solutions will help them manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. With this in mind, the US Food and Drug Administration has developed several programs to encourage the patient voice in drug development and healthcare.</p>\n<h2><strong>Patient Listening Sessions</strong></h2>\n<p>Hosted by the FDA&rsquo;s Office of Patient Affairs (OPA), together with the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and the Reagan-Udall Foundation, Patient Listening Sessions are small and informal conversations that bring patients/caregivers and researchers together.<sup>1</sup> These sessions are aimed at complementing the FDA&rsquo;s existing patient engagement initiatives.</p>\n<p>The agency has been conducting listening sessions since 2018, with a focus on disease experience rather than a particular medical drug, biologic, or device.<sup>2</sup> Thus, only patients, caregivers, patient advocates and staff of FDA Centers and programs are generally allowed to participate.</p>\n<p>For FDA medical product staff, Patient Listening Sessions are a resource for directly hearing from patients about their disease experience and gaining a view of the patient and caregiver perspectives. For the patient/caregiver, they are an opportunity to share their stories freely, advocate for patient needs and directly educate regulatory decision-making.</p>\n<p>Sessions can either be FDA-requested or patient-led:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FDA-requested sessions are instituted by FDA staff, where they ask questions to patients/caregivers.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Patient-led sessions are when members of the patient community actively share their stories while FDA personnel simply listen.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the FDA&rsquo;s list of concluded sessions, patient-led sessions have been conducted more frequently.<sup>2 </sup>Additional patient-led sessions are also already scheduled for later this year, including sessions to discuss lupus, SCN2A-related disorders (epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (a spinal cord disorder). This trend indicates that patients truly yearn to have a forum where they can speak directly with regulators.</p>\n<p>The aim of these sessions is to harness the patient voice as a guidepost in the research and development of future treatments and to overcome any hurdles that may be blocking the approval of much-needed treatments. For example, a recent listening session with hemophilia patients resulted in the creation of a public workshop and an online resource to inform the design of product development and clinical trial design in hemophilia.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Despite the pandemic, the FDA has made it possible to continually listen to patients through online means. For example, a session with the Von Hippel Lindau Alliance (VHLA) on June 11, 2020 was conducted via video conference.<sup>5</sup></p>\n<p>While discussions during these sessions are unofficial and not binding for the FDA, they offer a valuable resource for regulatory agency staff and support patient advocacy.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Patient Engagement Collaborative (PEC)</strong></h2>\n<p>The FDA&rsquo;s OPA also coordinates the PEC. In contrast to the Patient Listening Sessions, the PEC is an ongoing forum not only among patients and the FDA but also including other healthcare stakeholders. The FDA established the Collaborative together with the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative, which is a partnership that brings together representatives from regulatory agencies, patient advocacy groups, clinical investigators, academia, government, and industry, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inaugurated in August 2018, the PEC was borne out of patient community feedback that expressed the need for an outside group tasked to inform on patient engagement across the Agency. The Collaborative seeks to identify new models, communication tools and systems to enhance patient engagement, patient experience and transparency&nbsp;in the regulatory process.<sup>6</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>The FDA Patient Representative Program</strong><strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>This program is considered a flagship program of the FDA, prompting the agency to have its title trademarked. The FDA&rsquo;s Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff (ACOMS) manages the program, appointing members to the advisory committee as temporary Special Government Employees (SGEs). Patients and advocates are included among appointed persons.<sup>7</sup></p>\n<p>The FDA Patient Representative Program<sup>&reg;</sup> offers patients and caregivers the opportunity to voice their needs, priorities, preferences and advice on medical product development and decision-making. FDA Patient Representatives are tasked to serve on the FDA Advisory Committees and panels, where expert advice on policy and scientific and technical matters are drawn out. They also provide insights on medical product development early in the regulatory and development process and consult with the FDA&rsquo;s review divisions.</p>\n<p>The program is a deeper incorporation of the patient voice than the previous programs discussed, as the patient is integrated directly, although temporarily, into the FDA. Not only do FDA staff directly gain valuable information on patient experiences with various diseases and therapeutic devices, but select patients also gain access to confidential information.</p>\n<h2><strong>Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Programs</strong></h2>\n<p>The FDA&rsquo;s CDRH has programs designed to listen to the patient voice and inform on medical device decision-making. For example, it manages the Patient Engagement Advisory Committee (PEAC), which is mostly composed of patients, caregivers, or patient organization representatives with voting rights. The PEAC is not disease-specific but has a broad view of issues from patient access to medical devices and technical topics such as digital health technology and real-world data.<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>Another example is the Patient and Caregiver Connection (PCC), where the CDRH partners with patient organizations so that FDA staff can formally engage with patients and caregivers. What makes the PCC different from the Patient Learning Sessions is that it focuses on the patient experience in specific diseases, especially on their experience with the use of medical devices either for diagnosis, disease management or treatment.<sup>9</sup> As early as 2016, the FDA had established a public docket to receive input from patients, care partners and patient organizations to identify ways to best build patient partnerships in line with the PCC program.<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p>The FDA has maintained patient engagement initiatives over the years, adding to and improving efforts with increasingly innovative initiatives. Patients are in the best position to inform on their disease experience and any unmet medical needs, and the FDA is doing its part to make sure the patient voice is heard.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>FDA (April, 2020).
