As a result, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy. The CHMP also considered data on the medicine&rsquo;s quality and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for sotrovimab has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration and it is also under review by other global regulators including Health Canada under the expedited Interim Order application pathway for COVID-19 drugs. Sotrovimab is an investigational compound and has not been granted a marketing authorization anywhere in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-21 16:22:00", "meta_title": "Positive EMA scientific opinion for sotrovimab as COVID-19 therapy", "meta_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology Sotrivimab, VIR-7831, EMA, Opinion, COVID-19, Hospitalization", "meta_description": "Positive EMA scientific opinion for sotrovimab as COVID-19 therapy", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-21 16:21:40", "updated": "2021-05-21 16:28:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-ema-scientific-opinion-for-sotrovimab-as-covid-19-therapy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vir-biotechnology-large.png", "image2id": "vir-biotechnology-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology", "drug_tag": "sotrovimab, VIR-7831", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-21 16:22:00"}
