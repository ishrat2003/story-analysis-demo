The trial was conducted in Austria, Germany, Denmark and Russia. The multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, interventional Phase II trial assessed the safety, tolerability and efficacy of APN01 in 178 patients with severe COVID-19 compared to placebo. Both groups, APN01 (n=88) and placebo (n=90), also additionally received standard of care (SOC). Patients received treatment for seven days with follow-ups until day 28. March 15, 2021</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to see that treatment with APN01 has demonstrated promising clinical benefits for patients with severe COVID-19,&rdquo; said Peter Llewellyn-Davies, chief executive of APEIRON Biologics, adding: &ldquo;Our treatment has now been evaluated for the first time in patients with COVID-19&hellip;.We will now discuss the further development of APN01 with investigators, advisors and regulatory authorities in order to realize an important therapeutic option for this deadly disease.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Developed in response to the first SARS outbreak</strong></h2>\n<p>APN01 was first discovered and developed in response to the first SARS outbreak by the founder of APEIRON Biologics, Prof Josef Penninger in 2003. Before clinical development in COVID-19 started in April 2020, APN01 successfully completed several clinical trials in severe respiratory diseases like acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Lung injuries caused by ARDS are one of the major symptoms of severe COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Detailed analyses of the study results are ongoing and are planned to be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p>", "date": "2021-03-12 15:27:00", "meta_title": "APN01 shows clinical benefits for severely ill COVID-19 patients", "meta_keywords": "APEIRON Biologics, APN01, Alunacedase alfa, Phase II, COVID-19", "meta_description": "APN01 shows clinical benefits for severely ill COVID-19 patients", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-12 15:27:00", "updated": "2021-03-12 15:36:08", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/apn01-shows-clinical-benefits-for-severely-ill-covid-19-patients", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "apeiron_large.png", "image2id": "apeiron_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Austria", "company_tag": "APEIRON Biologics AG", "drug_tag": "alunacedase alfa, APN01", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-12 15:27:00"}
