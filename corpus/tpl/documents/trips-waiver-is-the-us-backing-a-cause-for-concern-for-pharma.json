It also flies in the face of President Biden&rsquo;s stated policy of building up American infrastructure and creating jobs by handing over American innovations to countries looking to undermine our leadership in biomedical discovery. This decision does nothing to address the real challenges to getting more shots in arms, including last-mile distribution and limited availability of raw materials. These are the real challenges we face that this empty promise ignores.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In the past few days alone, we&rsquo;ve seen more American vaccine exports, increased production targets from manufacturers, new commitments to COVAX and unprecedented aid for India during its devastating COVID-19 surge. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are fully committed to providing global access to COVID-19 vaccines, and they are collaborating at a scale that was previously unimaginable, including more than 200 manufacturing and other partnerships to date. The biopharmaceutical industry shares the goal to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, and we hope we can all re-focus on that shared objective.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>'Making vaccines is hard'</h2>\n<p>Law firms have also had their say.</p>\n<p>Tim Harris, partner at Osborne Clarke, said: &ldquo;I am not aware of anything showing that patent or other IP rights are causing a shortage of vaccine supply. On the contrary, even in rich countries that are willing and able to pay, we have seen shortages. This arises principally from bottlenecks in raw materials, manufacturing capacity, quality control and distribution, each of which are being addressed and improved. However, this takes time and none of these would be solved by the IP waivers proposed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Moreover, making new vaccines is hard: we've seen how even AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) has struggled to scale up its production &ndash; it needs considerable knowhow to ensure the manufacture of high-quality vaccines. Substandard vaccines may undermine the existing vaccination drive and give a false sense of security.<br /> <br />Mr Harris added: &ldquo;Neither has it been explained how knowhow, once transferred, can be &lsquo;revoked&rsquo; &ndash; because in practice this is not possible. This would be a major concern for all companies. For example, BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX) has been a pioneer of mRNA treatments which can be used for a wide range of diseases, and before COVID-19 was largely focused on various cancer treatments. If this knowhow is forcibly acquired by third parties, it fundamentally undermines property rights and reduces the likelihood that investment will be made in other technologies that could help in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Remaining blockers 'need to get out of the way'</h2>\n<p>Not everyone is so opposed to the US government&rsquo;s position, however. Among the groups that campaigned for governments to back the waiver is the People&rsquo;s Vaccine Alliance.</p>\n<p>This is a movement of health, humanitarian and human rights organizations, past and present world leaders, health experts, faith leaders and economists advocating that COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured rapidly and at scale, as global common goods, free of IP protections and made available to all people, in all countries, free of charge.</p>\n<p>Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now, part of the People&rsquo;s Vaccine Alliance. He has called for other western nations to take the same stance as the USA.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In the many months since this waiver was first proposed, we could have produced many hundreds of millions more vaccines. Let&rsquo;s get moving. The UK, European Union, and all remaining blockers need to get out of the way and let the whole world work to contain this awful virus as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>More symbolic than meaningful?</h2>\n<p>So should pharma companies, their shareholders and the wider industry be concerned?</p>\n<p>In principle, it is easy to see why the pharmaceutical industry is alarmed by the idea that IP can be cast aside in this way by the government of the world&rsquo;s leading superpower.</p>\n<p>In reality, it may turn out to be more of a symbolic gesture from a rich nation's new government to show its ethical approach in helping less wealthy populations to potentially access vaccines once its own people have been vaccinated, rather than a move that impacts heavily on drugmakers and the framework in which they operate.</p>", "date": "2021-05-17 10:02:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "vaccines, waiver, rights, pharmaceutical, COVID-, lives, global, government, American, months, countries, companies, TRIPS, people, trade, industry, save", "meta_description": "The mere notion of the US government supporting any policies that might encourage pharmaceutical patents to be ignored would have seemed inconceivable only 18 m", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-17 08:44:16", "updated": "2021-05-19 10:50:27", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/trips-waiver-is-the-us-backing-a-cause-for-concern-for-pharma", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "wto_ip_trade_big.jpg", "image2id": "wto_ip_trade_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Feature, Focus On, Government Affairs, In Depth, Legal, Patents & Trademarks", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GLOBAL JUSTICE NOW, Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-17 10:02:00"}
