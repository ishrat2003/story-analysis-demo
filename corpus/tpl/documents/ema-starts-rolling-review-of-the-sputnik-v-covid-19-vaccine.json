These studies indicate that Sputnik V triggers the production of antibodies and immune cells that target the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and may help protect against COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The EMA will evaluate data as they become available to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks. The rolling review will continue until enough evidence is available for formal marketing authorisation application.</p>\n<p>The EMA will assess Sputnik V&rsquo;s compliance with the usual EU standards for effectiveness, safety and quality. While the EMA cannot predict the overall timelines, it should take less time than normal to evaluate an eventual application because of the work done during the rolling review.</p>\n<p>EMA will communicate further when the marketing authorisation application for the vaccine has been submitted.</p>\n<p>The Gamaleya National Center and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) cooperate with national regulatory authorities around the world and provide comprehensive data on Sputnik V clinical trials.</p>\n<h2><strong>RDIF statement</strong></h2>\n<p>Responding to the EMA announcement, RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev stated: &ldquo;We welcome the start of the rolling review procedure by EMA of Sputnik V. We have provided EMA with comprehensive data on the Russian vaccine. Sputnik V can make an important contribution to saving millions of lives in Europe and we are looking forward to a thorough review of data by CHMP. Vaccine partnerships should be above politics and cooperation with EMA is a perfect example demonstrating that pooling efforts is the only way to end the pandemic. Following EMA approval, we would be able to provide vaccine for 50 million Europeans starting from June 2021.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A number of EU member states have made individual decisions to register Sputnik V without EMA approval. The vaccine is currently approved for use in Hungary and Slovakia, the RDIF noted. Globally, the Russian vaccine has now been cleared for use in 45 countries, including the approvals announced today for Sri Lanka, Laos and Iraq.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-04 16:02:00", "meta_title": "EMA starts rolling review of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine", "meta_keywords": "EMA, Rolling review, of Sputnik V, COVID-19, R-Pharm.
