Companies need to ask themselves the question &ndash; do they embrace Amazon or not, and what will be the impact of either option?</p>\n<h2>Better option for smaller manufacturers?</h2>\n<p>The clients I am speaking to are rightly concerned about how much control they will have in any relationship with the disruptor. If you look at Amazon&rsquo;s behavior across other sectors, you will see a company that not only owns the customer relationship and therefore data, but is also not afraid of predatory pricing to acquire market share, applying access fees to sellers and dictating terms of business.</p>\n<p>For some smaller manufacturers, even if they relinquish some control, the opportunity with Amazon could level up their playing field with an increased exposure to a huge customer base and greater access.</p>\n<p>However, for larger players, Amazon is a more powerful and potentially less accommodating partner. Ultimately, Amazon would be in control. Certainly for over-the-counter and generic drugs, it will be Amazon that decides whether to stock a particular product and woe betide any manufacturer who can&rsquo;t keep up with demand or falls short of expected service levels. Amazon will not be forgiving.</p>\n<p>In addition, manufacturers could end up commoditized by an algorithm driven e-commerce model which would force them to compete on price in reverse auctions. This will be felt particularly keenly if Amazon starts manufacturing its own brand of generic products through acquisitions in this sector. The whole market for competing non-Amazon products could be stripped away overnight in a move which would be in line with Amazon&rsquo;s previous actions in areas such as electronics and office supplies.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What other channels are available?</h2>\n<p>The right decision will also depend on the type of product. For example, for over-the-counter medicines (many of which are already sold on Amazon), this may be the right strategy (after all, if they don&rsquo;t, their competitors will). And yet, for larger companies with a strong market share, excellent supply chain logistics and with branded and specialist products that need a degree of customer service and specialist knowledge, it may not be.</p>\n<p>It is also worth asking what other channels, if you do not embrace Amazon, are available to you. For example, is there an opportunity to collaborate more closely with the large pharmacy chains and explore potential partnerships to create a better online seamless service for patients and customer?</p>\n<p>Companies that have withstood the Amazon threat in other industries, such as Music Magpie, are those that have turned to innovation alongside capitalizing on a more customer-centric model as a strategy, and the pharmaceutical sector is no exception.</p>\n<p>For those companies that decide to embrace Amazon, there are three key pillars that need to be put in place to ensure your company is able to withstand the disruptor&rsquo;s arrival and subsequently emerging market power:</p>\n<h2>Agility of supply chain</h2>\n<p>This is the number one priority and companies must make sure that they can respond to the opportunities and demand that comes alongside any partnership with Amazon. Amazon is potentially the &lsquo;Gorilla&rsquo; in the supply chain as the company will reduce margins and put pressure on any system that isn&rsquo;t able to deliver according to customer demand. The challenge will be the ability to keep up with new demand without ramping up costs. Companies should invest now in getting full control of their supply chain to minimize potential crisis and drive improvement in performance and optimal cost. Then focus on how to ensure they have the agility to be able to respond to opportunities.</p>\n<p>It is also worth looking at how this will work with Amazon&rsquo;s logistics which tend to be centralized and not country specific, potentially causing further pressure to a company&rsquo;s supply chain. Free movement of goods across Europe means that Amazon could potentially sell across Europe and will easily be able to buy a product from one country at a cheaper price and distribute to other countries at this reduced cost. Regulation prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from doing this but what is to stop Amazon? Companies need to predict this well in advance and decide on the best solution such as where savings can be made throughout the supply chain or on product costs ...</p>\n<h2>Demand Planning Management</h2>\n<p>If companies can predict demand they will be in a strong position to partner with Amazon. While pharmaceutical companies have been excellent at applying technology for developing and manufacturing drugs, demand planning is often manual and overseen by the logistics department. They may use IT systems to help but these are often legacy systems which lack sufficient data and interoperability between departments. This means information cannot be processed and used efficiently by health professionals. I have seen some senior management teams that are ambivalent about new technology as they don&rsquo;t yet see the urgency of ensuring their demand planning process is robust. This is something that needs to happen regardless of Amazon&rsquo;s entrance into the market place but becomes increasingly important for companies who wish to use Amazon Pharmacy as a distribution channel.</p>\n<p>By having the best data, pharmaceutical companies will be able to predict Amazon&rsquo;s demand or utilize this information to sell more effectively through other channels. Companies will need to make sure that they have the tools in place, such as an integrated process, patient and customer insights, key leading analytics, modelling and foresight, to shift to a more consumer-centric model and one that understands demand. While this is not happening enough in this sector, I have seen other clients in sectors such as retail use a hybrid model of AI technology and insight teams to ensure they have excellent demand planning capabilities.</p>\n<p>Anticipate how you will collaborate with Amazon &ndash; this will give you the competitive edge as ultimately Amazon owns the customer relationship but they are not yet experts in the pharmaceutical sector. Although Amazon is very protective of its own data it could potentially benefit from additional insight and knowledge from pharmaceutical experts. When I worked with Nestle, for example, they invested heavily in category teams which gave them relevant and important customer behavioural information which ultimately helped both Nestle and the end retailer.</p>\n<p>This could be further explored with Amazon. Management teams should ensure that collaborative planning forecasting and replenishing plans are shared and this should be done at the highest level with the top teams or CEOs from each company in regular dialogue. A good example of this collaboration with Amazon is Pharmapack, e-retailer of pharma and persona; hygience products. Its CEO has been quoted as saying that &lsquo;a big part of our business is our partnerships with Amazon, Walmart and eBay. Those are our three big partnerships that we&rsquo;re really focused on.&rsquo;. The company is on track to a &pound;1 billion ($1.38 billion) turnover so it is clearly a strategy that is working.</p>\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s arrival into the pharmaceutical market place heralds the emergence of a new dawn.</p>\n<p>Whether companies embrace it or not needs to be a strategic decision where the challenges and threats are continually reviewed. More resource, planning and onus on the commercial team will be needed as the whole industry will be forced to adopt a more customer-centric model.</p>", "date": "2021-03-23 13:39:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Amazon, companies, pharmaceutical, demand, customer, supply, chain, Amazons, market, opportunity, partner, manufacturers, Europe, arrival, sector, threat", "meta_description": "Debbie Bowen-Heaton's, partner at Oliver Wight, provides an Expert View on\u00c2\u00a0how companies can prepare for the disruption Amazon's arrival in Europe's pharmaceuti", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-23 09:21:58", "updated": "2021-03-25 10:43:37", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amazon-threat-or-opportunity-for-pharmaceuticals", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "amazon_big.jpg", "image2id": "amazon_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "All therapy areas", "topic_tag": "Digital Pharma, Expert View, Focus On, Health Medical Pharma, In Depth", "geography_tag": "Europe, UK", "company_tag": "Amazon, Oliver wight", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-23 13:39:00"}
