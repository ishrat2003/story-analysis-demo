This sub-licence specifically covers a manufacturing patent valid only in the USA (no corresponding patents exist in other countries) and adds to Faron's existing comprehensive patent portfolio for traumakine which includes use and IV formulation patents, as well as market exclusivity in Europe as an orphan medicine.</p>\n<p>Dr Markku Jalkanen, chief executive of Faron, commented: \"We are pleased to agree this sub-licence. We continue to believe in traumakine's potential as a much-needed new treatment for respiratory failure and organ protection.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Faron had chequered clinical trial history with the drug in ARDS in 2018, though later studies were more encouraging, and in March last year the FDA accepted proposed protocol for a new traumakine trial in ARDS. Traumakine has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Promising Innovative Medicines (PIM) designation by the UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>COVID-19 treatment potential</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr Jalkanen continued: \"Several recent publications have connected type 1 IFN with the severity of COVID-19 infections. Multiple associations have been drawn across the literature including deficiency of type 1 IFN; inborn errors of IFN-beta signalling; and the presence of auto-antibodies that neutralize the protective effect of type 1 IFN in viral infections. Patients who do not have an early IFN response appear to develop severe disease irrespective of the underlying reason for the deficiency. The continued further evidence supports the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients may become very ill because of an impaired interferon response.</p>\n<p>\"The administration of IFN is likely to benefit patients and relieve them from the hyper-inflammatory state that leads to severe disease. We believe intravenous administration of IFN-beta is the optimal route to compensate for this loss of first line viral defence and, in tandem induce CD73 a critical enzyme in organ protection during severe illness.\"</p>", "date": "2021-05-14 12:20:00", "meta_title": "Faron sub-licenses US rights to traumakine patent", "meta_keywords": "Faron Pharmaceuticals, Sub-licenses, US patent, Traumakine, ARDS, Respiratory distress syndrome, COVID-19", "meta_description": "Faron sub-licenses US rights to traumakine patent", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-14 12:19:18", "updated": "2021-05-14 12:31:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/faron-sub-licenses-us-rights-to-traumakine-patent", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "faron-big.png", "image2id": "faron-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Patents & Trademarks", "geography_tag": "Finland, USA", "company_tag": "Faron Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Traumakine", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-14 12:20:00"}
