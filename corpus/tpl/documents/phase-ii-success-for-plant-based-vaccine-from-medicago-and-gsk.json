After two doses, the adjuvanted vaccine candidate induced robust neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in all subjects, irrespectively of age.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These results give us confidence as we continue to move forward with our Phase III clinical trial. We hope to add another tool in the global fight against COVID-19, particularly as cross-protection emerges as an important consideration in vaccination efforts worldwide.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Thomas Breuer, GSK Vaccines&rsquo; chief medical officer, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to see that the results suggest a very strong immune response, Medicago&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine candidate combined with GSK&rsquo;s pandemic adjuvant was also well-tolerated, reinforcing its potential benefits.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We now look forward to the outcome of the ongoing Phase III trial of this refrigerator-stable vaccine candidate as the next step forward in our contribution to the global response to the pandemic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Phase III trial of the vaccine candidate launched on March 16, 2021.
