The Danish pharma in 2018 launched its daily therapy Norditropin (somatropin/rHGH) for children and adults in China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The aim of developing Sogroya is to reduce the&nbsp;treatment burden for patients by reducing injection frequency and potentially improving treatment adherence,&rdquo; a Novo Nordisk spokesman told the Pharma Letter. Daily injection, he said, is not something patients want for a lifetime treatment and does not encourage adherence.</p>\n<p>Indeed, China has about 7 million patients with the rare disease aged between four and 15, but fewer than 30,000 are going through therapies, according to Chinese Medical Association.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is only one major weekly HGH therapy in the Chinese market.</p>\n<p>Approved in 2014, Jin Sai Zeng is a polyethylene glycol (PEGlyed) rHGH weekly injection supplied by Changchun, Jilin province-based GeneScience. The company&rsquo;s daily treatment Sai Zeng dominates the HGH sector with a market share of nearly 70%, according to 2018 research carried out by the NMPA&rsquo;s research arm PICO.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Current daily options</strong></h2>\n<p>Other daily rHGH options include Pfizer&rsquo;s (NYSE: PFE) Genotropin (somatropin), LG Chem&rsquo;s Eutropin, and Ansomeone from Hefei-based Anke Bio, but Norditropin is the only treatment that can be stored at room temperature.</p>\n<p>HGH therapies are covered by China&rsquo;s national reimbursement list under category B, meaning patients will have to bear the most cost. It may explain why Jin Sai Zeng&rsquo;s market share was just 11%, according to the 2018 PICO research, despite its privilege as the only weekly treatment in China.</p>\n<p>Priced at about 5,600 renminbi ($860.2) per unit (54IU/9mg/1ml), Jin Sai Zeng typically costs about 190,000 renminbi per year for a patient, compared with 42,000 renminbi for liquid HGH injections and CNY20,000 for power HGH injections, according to government procurement prices.</p>\n<p>Novo Nordisk is not the only one in the long-acting HGH game. In mid-March, China gave IND approval to a weekly rHGH from Yifan Pharma, a Lin&rsquo;an, Zhejiang province-based company.</p>\n<p>There is also Visen, a Shanghai-based biotech start-up backed by the Danish biotech Ascendis Pharma (Nasdaq: ASND), and a group of investors including Vivo Capital. Visen is carrying out Phase III studies in China among children for lonapegsomatropin, a weekly rHCH from Ascendis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The asset, using transient conjunction to control drug release, has gained orphan drug designation for GHD in the USA and Europe. It is in Phase III studies among adults in the USA and is expected to get FDA approval as soon as in June 2021.</p>\n<p>Visen&rsquo;s rival I-Mab Biopharma (Nasdaq: IMAB) is also conducting Phase III studies in China among children for its asset eftansomatropin, a weekly rHGH injection developed by an I-Mab&rsquo;s early investor - the Korean biotech Genexine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Facing the upcoming competition, Novo Nordisk is confident</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;We have more than three decades of dedication and commitment to the pediatric and adult growth hormone communities. Our solid understanding of the GHD communities enables us to reduce patients&acute; burden of therapy and meet their lifestyle needs,&rdquo; said the company spokesman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Novo Nordisk in November signed an agreement with the local government in Shanghai to invest 200 million renminbi building a facility in the city that covers drug imports, distribution, marketing and R&amp;D to speed up bringing its novel drugs into the country.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-19 16:07:00", "meta_title": "Weekly HGH jabs rushing to China", "meta_keywords": "Human growth hormone, GHD, Weekly, Developments, Novo Nordisk, Sogroya, Pfizer, Genotropin, I-MAB, Eftansomatropin", "meta_description": "Weekly HGH jabs rushing to China", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-19 16:04:18", "updated": "2021-03-19 16:18:43", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/weekly-hgh-jabs-rushing-to-china", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "china_beijing_big.jpg", "image2id": "china_beijing_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Growth hormones", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Endocrinology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Markets & Marketing, Research", "geography_tag": "China", "company_tag": "I-Mab Biopharma, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "eftansomatropin, Genotropin, Sogroya", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-19 16:07:00"}
