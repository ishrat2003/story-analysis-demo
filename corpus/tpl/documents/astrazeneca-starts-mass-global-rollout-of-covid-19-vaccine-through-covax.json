This supply represents the first COVID-19 vaccine for many of these countries.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca was the first global pharmaceutical company to join COVAX in June 2020 in line with the company&rsquo;s shared commitment to global, equitable access to vaccines.</p>\n<p>Further shipments will arrive in the coming weeks with the aim of supplying a total of 142 countries with hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine in the coming months. The majority of these doses, manufactured by AstraZeneca and its licence partner Serum Institute of India, will go to low and middle-income countries.</p>\n<p>Pascal Soriot, chief executive of Astra Zeneca, said: &ldquo;These first steps towards fulfilling our broad, equitable and no-profit emergency response to the pandemic mean millions of people, irrespective of their country&rsquo;s income level, will soon be protected against this deadly virus. This is a moment of great pride for us at AstraZeneca and I am extremely grateful to our partners including Gavi, CEPI and Oxford University for their hard work and dedication in order to make this humanitarian ideal a reality for many millions of people around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, said: &ldquo;Global, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines is only possible when the public and private sectors work together. When we launched the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment in June 2020, our first agreement was with AstraZeneca. Nine months later, the first doses are already being delivered to those that need them most. This is the beginning of COVAX&rsquo;s effort to end the acute phase of the pandemic, not the end, but we can all take strength from this moment and I thank AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for their support and partnership at every step of our journey.&rdquo;00</p>", "date": "2021-03-02 16:38:00", "meta_title": "AstraZeneca starts mass global rollout of COVID-19 vaccine through COV", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca,  COVID-19 vaccine, Rollout, COVAX, Serum Institute of India, Gavi", "meta_description": "AstraZeneca starts mass global rollout of COVID-19 vaccine through COVAX", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-02 16:37:38", "updated": "2021-03-02 16:46:29", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astrazeneca-starts-mass-global-rollout-of-covid-19-vaccine-through-covax", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "coronavirus_structure_large.jpg", "image2id": "coronavirus_structure_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Public health", "geography_tag": "Global", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, Gavi, Serum Institute of India", "drug_tag": "COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-02 16:38:00"}
