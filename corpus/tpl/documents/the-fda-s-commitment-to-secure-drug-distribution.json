Nevertheless, such drugs continue to end up in circulation, compromising patient safety.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is responsible for all FDA-conducted investigations, including those on suspected illegitimate drugs. Additionally, it participates in several law enforcement task forces, with the FDA sometimes coordinating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other agencies in the enforcement of drug distribution laws.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>We discuss the challenges faced in drug distribution security, recent violations of drug distribution laws, and the actions taken by the FDA to secure the US drug supply.</p>\n<h2><strong>Current challenges in drug distribution security</strong></h2>\n<p><em>The COVID-19 pandemic</em></p>\n<p>The widespread panic induced by the pandemic has created a breeding ground for drug traffickers, counterfeiters, and other agents distributing illegitimate drugs. Additionally, there has been a rise in the cases of quackery, which is defined as &ldquo;the fraudulent misrepresentation of the diagnosis and treatment of disease.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In April 2021, a Florida family was indicted for fraudulently marketing and selling a &lsquo;cure&rsquo; for COVID-19 and other diseases; the product was actually toxic industrial bleach.<sup>3</sup> To avoid government regulation and prosecution, they marketed the product, called &ldquo;Miracle Mineral Solution,&rdquo; through a company deceptively named &ldquo;Genesis II Church of Health and Healing.&rdquo; Consumption of the product resulted in hospitalizations, the development of life-threatening conditions, and deaths.</p>\n<p><em>Increased reliance on online ordering and mail-delivered medicines</em></p>\n<p>Online pharmacies were popular even before the pandemic. Similarly, through a legitimate process, insurance companies and Prescription Benefit Managers have been delivering medicines to patients via the US Postal Service. Although this trend has enabled social distancing during the pandemic, regular use of these services has led to a false sense of security among patients, increasing their susceptibility to peddlers of counterfeit and illegitimate products.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p><em>Patient inability to afford life-saving drugs</em></p>\n<p>Rising co-payments for specialty and life-saving treatments such as anti-cancer drugs have resulted in patients struggling to afford treatment. Desperate attempts to look for affordable treatment options can lead patients into the hands of illegitimate drug distributors.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Recent violations</strong></h2>\n<p>Here, we consider some recent violations that were investigated by the FDA-OCI in coordination with other agencies.</p>\n<p><em>Misbranding</em></p>\n<p>Misbranding involves false or misleading labeling.<sup>5</sup> In April 2021, a federal court sentenced Daniel Kevin Richards, who imported misbranded chloroquine from China in April 2020, to three years of probation and a fine of $10,000.<sup>6</sup> The drug was mislabeled as &ldquo;Boswellia Serrata Extract.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Tampering</em></p>\n<p>In April 2021, a federal court in Boston sentenced a nurse to 42 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for tampering with liquid morphine intended for patients at a nursing home and acquiring the controlled substance by deception and subterfuge.<sup>7</sup> After diverting the liquid morphine for his own use, the nurse attempted to cover up the crime by replacing the medicine with saline or Benadryl, which resulted in patients receiving sub-potent treatment.</p>\n<p><em>Counterfeit drugs</em></p>\n<p>Counterfeit drugs are &ldquo;fake medicine that may be contaminated or contain the wrong or no active ingredient, or the correct active ingredient at the wrong dose.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;In a recent investigation of counterfeit drug trafficking, the FDA-OCI joined forces with the Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. In April 2021, the trafficker was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment&nbsp;and ordered to pay a restitution of $3,648,911.18.<sup>9</sup> He knowingly trafficked drugs with counterfeit trademarks of various pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Bayer, Eli Lilly and Company, and Roche.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA policies for secure drug distribution</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Drug Supply Chain Security Act</em></p>\n<p>This Act aims to enable the development of a secure, electronic, interoperable system to monitor the distribution of prescription drugs in the US and eliminate counterfeit, contaminated, and other illegal products. Additionally, it directs the establishment of national licensure standards for wholesale distributers and third-party logistics providers and dictates that these parties should annually report licensure and other information to the FDA.<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p><em>Reporting of identified or suspected illegitimate products</em></p>\n<p>Upon identifying an illegitimate drug product, manufacturers, re-packagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers are required to notify the FDA within 24 hours.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, the FDA requires stakeholders to report significant losses, theft, and falsification of prescription drug samples and requests them to report suspected criminal activity.<sup>11,12</sup> Through the MedWatch Online Voluntary Reporting Form, healthcare professionals and patients can report quality issues and therapeutic failure related to a medicine, which could potentially indicate counterfeit, tampered, adulterated, or misbranded products.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Warning letters</em></p>\n<p>Upon identifying violations of drug regulations, the FDA issues Warning Letters to violators, including rogue online pharmacies. These letters indicate the violator&rsquo;s name and address, violation, and required corrective action.<sup>14</sup></p>\n<p><em>Improving awareness</em></p>\n<p>Through its BeSafeRx campaign, the FDA educates consumers and patients about the risks of ordering prescription drugs from rogue websites and alerts them about illegitimate online pharmacies determined. Furthermore, the FDA educates healthcare providers about purchasing medicines from licensed sources through its Know Your Source program, and issues letters alerting doctors about illegitimate medicines that they may have possibly received from a rogue distributor.<sup>11</sup></p>\n<p><em>Securing global drug distribution</em></p>\n<p>Considering the globalization of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, it is important to ensure secure drug distribution in the global marketplace. According to the FDA, many counterfeit drugs in the US originate from outside the country. Coordination with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection enables the FDA to track and prevent the entry of illegitimate drug products into the US.<sup>15</sup> In addition, the FDA has created a drug supply chain security toolkit to educate healthcare professionals, industry stakeholders, and regulators across the world regarding the best practices to prevent the exposure of consumers and patients to unsafe and substandard drugs.<sup>16</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Further steps to improve drug distribution security</strong></h2>\n<p>In an October 2020 article, Peter J. Pitts, Former FDA Associate Commissioner, discussed further potential measures to improve safe drug distribution. These recommendations include the implementation of strategies for measurable demand reduction among patients and healthcare practitioners, eliminating drug-related commercial activities on the Internet, and increasing patient awareness about programs that reduce co-payment costs.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>The actions taken by the FDA indicate its strong commitment towards ensuring the distribution of safe and effective medicines during the pandemic, as well as in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>US Food and Drug Administration.
