{"contentid": 488383, "importid": NaN, "name": "Second indication of Sarclisa for relapsed MM approved by EC", "introduction": "The European Commission (EC) has approved Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with Amgen's Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone (Kd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy.", "content": "<p>The European Commission (EC) has approved Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with Amgen's (Nasdaq: AMGN) Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone (Kd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This marks the second EC approval for French pharma major Sanofi&rsquo;s (Euronext: SAN) Sarclisa in combination with a standard of care regimen in less than 12 months. Sanofi shares were up 1.1% at 85.97 euros by late morning trading today.</p>\n<p>This adds to the competition against Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) unit Janssen&rsquo;s multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab), which Sanofi hopes Sarclisa will outperform. Janssen has also been able to secure approval for a new subcutaneous formulation of Darzalex, dubbed <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-darzalex-fasbro\">Darzalex Faspro</a>, offering a much faster and easier mode of administration.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sales forecasts</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts have suggested that peak sales of up to $1 billion could be realistic for Sarclisa, while Darzalex is already exceeding $4 billion in annual revenues.</p>\n<p>Sanofi itself estimates the total third-line market opportunity in the USA and major European markets at $3.4 billion. The second-line market estimate is much larger, at $6 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As there is no cure for&nbsp;multiple myeloma and patients often&nbsp;experience disease relapse, we must persist in our pursuit for additional treatment options. Nearly 30% of patients treated with the Sarclisa regimen had a profound response with undetectable levels of multiple myeloma,&rdquo; said Dr Philippe Moreau, Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Nantes, France. &ldquo;This new therapeutic regimen has the potential to become&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard of care for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who now have another treatment option earlier in the progression of their disease,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follows US approval in March</strong></h2>\n<p>This EC approval closely follows the US Food and Drug Administration authorization of Sarclisa for a similar indication in March 2021. In June 2020, Sanofi announced Sarclisa received EC approval in combination with another standard of care regimen, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex),&nbsp;for the treatment of adult&nbsp;patients&nbsp;with relapsed and refractory MM who have received at least two prior therapies&nbsp;including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The EC approval of Sarclisa in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone means patients living with multiple myeloma in Europe can now receive Sarclisa&nbsp;in combination with two standard of care treatment regimens,&rdquo; said Peter Adamson, global development head, oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi, adding: &ldquo;The carfilzomib and dexamethasone combination&nbsp;represents an important&nbsp;standard of care in Europe. The Phase III IKEMA trial&rsquo;s finding that the addition of Sarclisa to this regimen reduced&nbsp;the risk of progression or death by nearly half formed the basis for this important EC approval.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Sarclisa efficacy and safety profile in difficult-to-treat patients</strong></h2>\n<p>This approval is based on data from the Phase III IKEMA study, a randomized, multi-center, open label clinical trial that enrolled 302 patients with relapsed MM across 69 centers spanning 16 countries. The primary endpoint of IKEMA was progression free survival (PFS). While median PFS, defined as time to disease progression or death, for Kd was 19.15 months, the median PFS for patients receiving Sarclisa added to carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Sarclisa combination therapy; n=179) had not been reached at the time of the pre-planned interim analysis. Sarclisa combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% (hazard ratio 0.531, 99% CI 0.318-0.889, p=0.0007) versus standard of care Kd alone in patients with MM.</p>", "date": "2021-04-19 10:46:00", "meta_title": "Second indication of Sarclisa for relapsed MM approved by EC", "meta_keywords": "Sanofi, Sarclisa, Multiple myeloma, MM, Amgen, Kyprolis, European Commission, Approval", "meta_description": "Second indication of Sarclisa for relapsed MM approved by EC", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-19 10:44:38", "updated": "2021-04-19 10:56:10", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/second-indication-of-sarclisa-for-relapsed-mm-approved-by-ec", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "2020_sanofi_big.jpg", "image2id": "2020_sanofi_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Multiple myeloma", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, France", "company_tag": "Amgen, Janssen, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "Darzalex, Kyprolis, Sarclisa", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-19 10:46:00"}
