We went public last year and spoke about things like annuity-type models, where it works for those countries, and various other types of models, so innovative models, to help them. That has also been super-important.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Wealth not a prerequisite for access&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>These unique and bespoke reimbursement solutions can also be seen in the rest of the world where access has been agreed, such as the USA, Japan and Israel.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think we have proven that we have been flexible in terms of the results that we have been able to get across the world,&rdquo; Mr Fraser said, and he stressed that it was not just authorities in the world&rsquo;s wealthiest nations that Novartis has been successfully engaging with.</p>\n<p>The company is in very deep negotiations with nations in central and eastern Europe, for example, and is working in very close collaboration with their health authorities, in the expectation of announcing access agreements soon.</p>\n<p>Collaboration not just with the health authorities but with the whole ecosystem can be so important in rare diseases, Mr Fraser stressed, and he listed patient advocacy groups, healthcare practitioners and politicians as other interested parties that Novartis has forged close relationships with to get them working together on Zolgensma.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A basketball terminology would be a full-court press,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Getting the whole ecosystem to work very collaboratively together.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>'Breaking through a new frontier'</h2>\n<p>Encouragingly, Novartis&rsquo; work on achieving rapid reimbursement with Zolgensma could point the way for other gene therapies and transformative treatments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know a lot of people in the field and we are getting a lot of feedback, saying &ldquo;you guys are opening the doors for us&rdquo;,&rdquo; Mr Fraser added. &ldquo;It is such an exciting time because I would say we are breaking through a new frontier.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-26 10:22:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-26 09:06:04", "updated": "2021-04-27 08:23:24", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-full-court-press-key-to-ensuring-rapid-zolgensma-access", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novartis_logo_big.jpg", "image2id": "novartis_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Feature, Focus On, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "Novartis", "drug_tag": "Zolgensma", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-26 10:22:00"}
