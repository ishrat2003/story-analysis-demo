Their significance is well illustrated by the fact that 300 million people worldwide have some kind of rare disease, about half of whom are children. In the European Union, almost 30 million people is directly affected and 100 million indirectly affected, including family members. Four-fifths of rare diseases are of genetic origin, while the remaining ones are caused by bacterial and viral infections or environmental factors.</p>\n<h2><strong>Hungary at the forefront of the region</strong></h2>\n<p>The AIPM says that Hungary is a leader in the treatment of rare diseases in its region, as almost 40% of the latest therapies approved by the European Medicines Agency for rare hematological, oncological, neurological and metabolic diseases, among others, are available with domestic funding. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is particularly important because rare diseases affect about 600,000 people in Hungary, for whom access to innovative, effective therapies offers a new chance to either recover or alleviate or prevent the deterioration of their complaints.</p>\n<p>Hungary&rsquo;s achievements in this field are due to the supportive and helpful attitude of the National Health Insurance Fund, which provides funding, as well as the constructive cooperation of the innovative pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The AIPM expects that access to innovative medicinal products for rare diseases will become even smoother in the future, and that newly-developed therapies for other, more frequent, but serious diseases will reach patients in Hungary faster and more widely than before, as this would not only reduce the burden on the healthcare system, but it would offer a new opportunity for even more Hungarian patients,&rdquo; commented AIPM director Dr Peter Holchacker.</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;hungary_credit_depositphotos</p>", "date": "2021-03-22 10:13:00", "meta_title": "Hungarian patients have ever better chances, but still work to be done", "meta_keywords": "Hungary, Rare diseases, Drugs, Access, Funding, AIPM", "meta_description": "Hungarian patients have ever better chances, but still work to be done, says trade group", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-21 14:12:01", "updated": "2021-03-22 10:13:44", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/hungarian-patients-have-ever-better-chances-but-still-work-to-be-done-says-trade-group", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "hungary_credit_depositphotos_large-1.jpg", "image2id": "hungary_credit_depositphotos_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Hungarian Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Pricing, reimbursement and access, Public health", "geography_tag": "Hungary", "company_tag": "AIPM, National Health Insurance Fund", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-22 10:13:00"}
