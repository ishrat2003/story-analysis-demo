Editor</p>\n<p>Among last week&rsquo;s notable news, Biogen and Sage Therapeutics presented new data on their essential tremor candidate SAGE-324, which raised questions on tolerability. Roche and Regeneron released Phase III data confirming the efficacy of their COVID-19 antibody cocktail &ndash; casirivimab and imdevimab &ndash; for the treatment of this infection. In another disappointment in the COVID-19 space, Merck &amp; Co said it is discontinuing development of MK-7110 as a treatment for hospitalized patients. In the latest investigation of thromboembolic events linked to novel coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has launched a review of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 candidate. On the deal making front, the UK&rsquo;s C4X Discovery signed an agreement with French pharma major Sanofi on an oral pre-clinical interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor program.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sage&rsquo;s technical tremor win fails to move</strong></h2>\n<p>When a disease has no available treatments for its underlying cause any clinical success is welcome. This holds true for essential tremor and for Sage/Biogen&rsquo;s Sage-324, whose <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sage-and-biogen-shares-dip-on-essential-tremor-drug-s-questionable-tolerability\">Phase II KINETIC study</a> just about cleared the efficacy bar in this disease, commented Jacob Plieth and Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>However, investors wondering whether Sage-324 is now de-risked are not celebrating just yet, and the stock crept down 2% that morning. Among the concerns are the win&rsquo;s narrow margin, a high rate of adverse events, and Sage&rsquo;s admission that, rather than going into Phase III, a new mid-stage study was now needed.</p>\n<p>The biggest worries to emerge from KINETC are that 68% and 38% of patients on Sage-324 experienced somnolence and dizziness respectively, and though there were no falls, 15% had balance disorder. 38% of subjects on active treatment discontinued, while dosing had to be reduced in 62%.</p>\n<p>Stifel analysts wrote that such levels of somnolence and dizziness were &ldquo;simply too high&rdquo; to differentiate Sage-324, a Gaba A modulator. In other diseases even a high rate of adverse events might not be disastrous, but essential tremor patients tend to be old and afflicted by comorbidities.</p>\n<p>Mizuho&rsquo;s Vamil Divan noted Sage saw better results in the 47 patients with more severe tremor, where the P value was 0.007, &ldquo;suggesting the drug may have a more clear role in that population.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Both he and RBC&rsquo;s Brian Abrahams, though, agreed the drug&rsquo;s side effects could significantly impair its commercial viability. Mr Divan rated the readout a tick positive for Sage. Mr Abrahams argued it was a tick negative, but largely inconsequential for two companies facing bigger questions elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We see a limited path forward for &lsquo;324 to show clinically meaningful effects with an acceptable benefit/risk profile in this relatively benign disease,&rdquo; he said while giving room for Sage to explore lower doses or target just severe populations. &ldquo;Both Sage and [Biogen] have far more major binary events this quarter.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Positive REGEN-COV MAb results in prophylactic setting support expanded use</strong></h2>\n<p>Last Monday, Regeneron and Roche announced positive results from two Phase III trials for <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-iii-data-confirm-potency-of-roche-coronavirus-treatment\">REGEN-COV antibody cocktail</a> in the prophylactic setting to reduce risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, not SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>\n<p>Regeneron will share the data with the Food and Drug Administration and request Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) expansion to include use of the 1,200mg dose subcutaneous formulation in these settings, and he expects approval to be forthcoming in late second quarter. Given the limited supply of the antibodies, and the contracts already in place, he does not expect any upside in quarter two, but this positive result should deliver a higher tail of revenue in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and potentially also from Ex-US markets.</p>\n<p>The 2069A trial assessed the ability of REGEN-COV to reduce the risk and burden of infection among household contacts of infected individuals while the 2069B trial assessed the ability of REGEN-COV to reduce the risk and burden of progressing to symptomatic disease among recently infected asymptomatic patients. Both Phase III trials evaluated one 1,200mg dose of REGEN-COV in the subcutaneous formulation administered in four 300mg injections versus placebo. The 2069A study found REGEN-COV provided 72% protection against symptomatic infections in the first week, 93% in subsequent weeks, and among those who developed symptomatic infections, REGEN-COV treatment led to faster virus clearance and shorter symptom duration.</p>\n<p>The 2069B study found REGEN-COV reduced overall risk of progressing to symptomatic disease by 31%, 76% after the third day, and shortened symptom duration and reduced viral levels. Mr Porges believes the positive results from the prophylactic settings support expanded utilization of REGEN-COV and should further reinforce its position as a complement to vaccines since it also appears to be the most effective antibody cocktail against emerging immune-resistant variants. In the prophylactic setting, he will also be looking for results from 600mg subcutaneous formulation, which could improve utilization even further. Leerink currently estimates REGEN-COV revenue of $2.36 billion and $343 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively.</p>\n<h2><strong>Merck&rsquo;s COVID-10 push narrows further</strong></h2>\n<p>Merck &amp; Co had already bowed out of the COVID-19 vaccine arena. Now its efforts at developing a therapy for the virus have taken a step back too, noted Madeleine Armstrong and Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>The company said today that it was <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-to-discontinue-mk-7110-for-covid-19-development\">discontinuing development of MK-7110</a>, which it gained through its $425 million buyout of OncoImmune, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As for its second big hope, the oral antiviral molnupiravir, Merck has scrapped a trial in hospitalized patients; all expectations for the project now rest on a pivotal study in outpatients.</p>\n<p>The antiviral pipeline for treating COVOD-19 thus now looks even sparser. And the developments are yet another example of how several big names in the vaccine and antiviral space have stumbled, while newcomers have capitalised on opportunities arising from the pandemic.</p>\n<p>MK-7110 is also in development for other indications,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04095858\">the most advanced being graft-versus-host disease</a>, so maybe Merck can still recoup some of the cash it has spent.</p>\n<p>In any case, Merck&rsquo;s only COVID-19 hope is now molnupiravir, which is being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.</p>\n<p>And this project&rsquo;s only shot is in outpatients. Merck today said it had decided to discontinue the Phase II/III MOVE-In study in hospitalized patients, after the Phase II portion had shown that molnupiravir was unlikely to show a benefit.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is not surprising: many other agents have struggled to make an impact in this population, and it seems that most therapies need to be given early in the course of disease to have a chance of having an effect.</p>\n<p>If antivirals are broadly ineffective in hospitalized Covid-19 patients this could be bad news for the likes of Roche and Pfizer, which both have inpatient trials of their agents ongoing, said Ms Armstrong and Mr Plieth.</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA and CDC calling to halt distribution of J&amp;J vaccine deals blow to global effort</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the news that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a joint statement calling for an <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cdc-and-fda-recommend-pausing-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-use\">immediate pause to the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) vaccine</a>, GlobalData&rsquo;s infectious disease analyst Emily Martyn commented: &ldquo;This pause for J&amp;J is another terrible blow to global vaccination efforts &ndash; especially followed by J&amp;J&rsquo;s delayed Europe rollout, Australia&rsquo;s decision to decline use of the vaccine altogether, and the recent troubles seen by AstraZeneca. GlobalData believes that these developments will hamper current international vaccination efforts both in terms of available vaccine and decreased public confidence. US COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are also likely to see slowdown.</p>\n<p>Further exacerbating the situation, these developments arose less than two weeks after 15 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine were disposed due to a human error mix up between ingredients at a production plant in Maryland, USA. As a result of the delayed production of new doses, and postponed approval until the FDA completes its investigation into the issue, the US government has reduced the allocation of the J&amp;J vaccine from five million doses to just 700,000 doses for the week commencing Monday 12 April. In aggregate, this has been a disastrous week for anyone hoping that J&amp;J&rsquo;s single-dose vaccine would rapidly help quell the outbreak, according to Ms Martyn.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With variants of SARS-CoV-2 such as B.117 spreading rapidly through Europe, slowing the outbreak and reducing the incidence of new COVID-19 cases will depend heavily on vaccination efforts. Continued vaccination of vulnerable people is urgently needed to prevent severe cases and deaths from COVID-19. While there are few alternatives to the J&amp;J vaccine, vaccine hesitancy is a public health issue of significant importance. J&amp;J and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccines both utilize an adenoviral vector platform, which might be why both have similar side effects,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<h2><strong>C4X shows being early to the party can bring success</strong></h2>\n<p>C4X Discovery&rsquo;s business model, of out-licensing rather than developing projects in house, looks like it is starting to deliver, commented Lisa Urquhart on Evaluate Vantage. This week the UK group announced a 414 million-euro ($494 million) biodollar <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/c4x-discovery-inks-lucrative-c4xd-oral-il-17a-inhibitor-deal\">licensing deal with Sanofi</a> for its oral pre-clinical IL-17A inhibitor program. While the upfront payment of 7 million euros was slightly more modest, landing a big-name partner was enough help drive shares in the UK biotech up by 8%.</p>\n<p>The deal with Sanofi follows an agreement with Indivior in 2018, worth $10 million up front, and is all part of a plan by C4X's chief executive, Clive Dix, to hand off assets before they even hit the clinic. Speaking to <em>Evaluate Vantage</em> he said: &ldquo;We think our technology is best placed finding molecules, getting good quality starting points, taking them as far as we can as a candidate and out licensing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In C4X&rsquo;s deal with Sanofi, the French company will take on all of the risks and cost of commercializing the oral IL-17 inhibitor, which will be developed initially in psoriasis.</p>\n<p>The current leading IL-17 inhibitor for psoriasis, Novartis's Cosentyx, sold almost $3 billion for this use last year, but as a MAb it tends to be reserved for more severe forms of the disorder.</p>\n<p>The deal with Sanofi has brought some renewed investor interest in the company, whose shares had hit historic lows earlier this year. But at 43 pence the stock is&nbsp;still a long way off the 130p it hit in 2016, making C4X look relatively cheap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But Mr Dix is not interested in selling anytime soon, said Mr Urquhart. &ldquo;The end goal is to make this a sustainable drug discovery engine. Roll forward five or six years and if we have done another three deals, then you have an expectation of revenues coming in all the time and it&rsquo;s a fairly chunky business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-18 10:38:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 16, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Biogen, Sage Therapeutics, SAGE-324, Roche, Regeneron, REGEN-COV, Merck & Co, MK-7119, Johnson & Johnson, C4X Discovery, Sanofi, COVID-19", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to April 16, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-18 10:36:10", "updated": "2021-04-18 10:53:20", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-16-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders, CNS Diseases, Infectious diseases, Neurological, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Deals, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Biogen, C4X Discovery, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche, Sage Therapeutics, Sanofi", "drug_tag": "MK-7110, REGEN-COV2, SAGE-324", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-18 10:38:00"}
