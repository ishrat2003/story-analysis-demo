In the meantime, Biomay has become a formally qualified supplier for BioNTech. The scope of services includes process and analytical development, followed by GMP preparation of the cell bank, manufacturing of circular DNA plasmid and finally preparation of the linear DNA template.<br /> <br /> In 2021, Biomay has produced and delivered multiple batches of released DNA template and supported the mRNA vaccine production thanks to this important manufacturing component, and the company will continue to do so throughout the year.<br /> <br /> Hans Huber, chief executive of Biomay, says he is pleased about cooperating with BioNTech on this globally essential project, noting: \"Biomay is proud to be making an active contribution to combating the coronavirus pandemic. Our staff are highly motivated and fully aware of the major responsibility associated with this cooperation. We would like to thank BioNTech for their trust in Biomay&acute;s expertise. We have been able to demonstrate that our proprietary plasmid manufacturing platform is well suited to supply the required high quality and large volume of DNA template.\"</p>", "date": "2021-05-18 10:14:00", "meta_title": "Biomay cooperates with BioNTech on COVID-19 mRNA vaccine", "meta_keywords": "Biomay, BioNTech, Comirnaty,  COVID-19, mRNA, Vaccine, Production", "meta_description": "Biomay cooperates with BioNTech on COVID-19 mRNA vaccine", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-18 10:04:22", "updated": "2021-05-18 10:14:23", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biomay-cooperates-with-biontech-on-covid-19-mrna-vaccine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biomay-big.png", "image2id": "biomay-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On, Production", "geography_tag": "Austria, Germany", "company_tag": "Biomay, BioNTech", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-18 10:14:00"}
