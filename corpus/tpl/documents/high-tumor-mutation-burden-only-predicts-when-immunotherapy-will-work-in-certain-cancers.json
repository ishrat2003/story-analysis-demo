It follows that a high TMB would render tumors more immunogenic, which is why TMB status has become a leading candidate biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response, Dr McGrail explained.</p>\n<h2>Keytruda case study</h2>\n<p>In June 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for treating patients with advanced and refractory cancers with a high TMB, as indicated by a defined threshold level of mutations. The approval was based on results from the Phase II KEYNOTE-158 study, which found improved overall responses in patients with a high TMB. However, the trial did not include several cancer types, such as breast, prostate and brain cancers, which have not typically responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.</p>\n<p>Senior author Shiaw-Yih Lin, professor of systems biology, said: &ldquo;The FDA approval of pembrolizumab for patients with high TMB certainly provides an important option for many patients.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;However, we felt that it was important to look more closely at TMB status in a broader group of cancer types and establish approaches to harmonize TMB across various assays to enable clinicians to best utilize the recent FDA approval.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The researchers analyzed over 10,000 tumors across 31 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas to study the relationship between TMB status and tumor immunogenicity, measured by the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor. They identified two classes of tumors &ndash; those with and without a strong correlation between TMB status and T cell infiltration.</p>\n<h2>'Not&nbsp;generalizable across all cancers'</h2>\n<p>The authors predicted that TMB status would not be able to predict immunotherapy response equally in these two groups. They evaluated this using previously published studies and MD Anderson patient cohorts.</p>\n<p>For cancers with a strong correlation between TMB status and T cell infiltration, patients with a high TMB had improved clinical outcomes. Across all cancer types in this category, patients with a high TMB had a 39.8% overall response rate to checkpoint inhibitors, which was significantly higher than those with a low TMB.</p>\n<p>In contrast, TMB status was not predictive of outcome in the second class of tumors. Within this category, patients with a high TMB had a 15.3% overall response rate, which was actually lower than the response rate for patients with low TMB.</p>\n<p>Dr McGrail added: &ldquo;While TMB status does show value in predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade in several cancer types, this was not generalizable across all cancers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For those cancer types where a high TMB does not appear to increase immunogenicity, additional prospective studies are needed to determine if TMB status can be an effective clinical biomarker and at what threshold.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-15 13:50:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "cancer, high, status, response, cancers, tumor, predicting, study, immunotherapy, types, biomarker, patients, immune, work, checkpoint, universal, results", "meta_description": "A new study led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has shed some light on the matter of predicting when immunotherapies will ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-15 12:33:05", "updated": "2021-03-15 13:53:23", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/high-tumor-mutation-burden-only-predicts-when-immunotherapy-will-work-in-certain-cancers", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "immunotherapy-big.jpg", "image2id": "immunotherapy-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Health Medical Pharma, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co", "drug_tag": "Keytruda", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-15 13:50:00"}
