ACCD 2 will invest directly in late-stage product financing opportunities, as well as through its co-development portfolio companies Avillion in the UK, and SFJ Pharmaceuticals in the USA.</p>\n<h2>Big pharma partnerships</h2>\n<p>Avillion and SFJ finance and facilitate clinical trial execution, using their operational expertise to increase the speed and quality of the trials. They incur all the clinical and regulatory risk and receive a pre-negotiated return once the drug is approved.</p>\n<p>UK-headquartered Abingworth boasts that it pioneered the clinical co-development investment strategy in 2009, investing initially via its venture funds and then alongside the first dedicated fund &ndash; Abingworth Clinical Co-Development Fund (ACCD 1), which launched in 2016.</p>\n<p>To date, Abingworth has made 11 investments in co-development opportunities through Avillion and SFJ. Of the seven that have completed, six resulted in pre-negotiated pay-outs to the fund and five resulted in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals.</p>\n<p>Partnerships with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Apellis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: APLS), Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) and PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: PHAS) are ongoing.</p>\n<h2>New appointments</h2>\n<p>As part of the new fund closing, James Cornwall, has joined Abingworth as partner in charge of business development for clinical co-development deals and will work alongside the investment partners. Dr Cornwall has more than 25 years&rsquo; pharmaceutical and contract research organization (CRO) industry experience, including roles in clinical research and corporate development.</p>\n<p>He was formerly with Nuvelution, a structured finance investment vehicle, and Quintiles, a global CRO that is now part of IQVIA (NYSE: IQV).</p>\n<p>In addition, David Simmons, chairman and chief executive of US CRO PPD (Nasdaq: PPD) and former Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) executive, has been appointed as a senior advisor to Abingworth, focusing on its clinical co-development strategy.</p>\n<h2>'New medicines in reduced time'</h2>\n<p>Kurt von Emster, managing partner, said: &ldquo;Our bespoke clinical co-development approach has succeeded as an alternative investment strategy since we pioneered the concept a decade ago, both in terms of generating returns for investors and gaining new product approvals. Our CCD program enables biotech companies to avoid near-term equity dilution and enables resource constrained pharma companies to pursue additional clinical projects.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As we expand our CCD efforts, we have augmented the team and are very pleased to welcome David Simmons and James Cornwall, whose breadth of pharma and CRO expertise will be important as we continue to execute this approach in the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tim Haines, chairman and managing partner, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to announce this new CCDF that, combined with our $465 million ABV 8 fund, brings new funds closed by Abingworth in 2021 to over $1 billion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With ABV 8 primarily targeting company creation and development stage opportunities, ACCD 2 provides a substantial, dedicated fund that invests alongside our venture funds to finance late-stage co-development opportunities with the potential to bring new medicines to patients in a reduced time frame. Our investments in this strategy, combined with our venture investments have contributed to 19 new medicines gaining FDA approval in the last eight years.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-10 16:22:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Abingworth, fund, clinical, co-development, million, investment, funds, late-stage, ACCD, companies, research, life, closing, closed, finance, billion, dru", "meta_description": "Life sciences investment group Abingworth has announced the final closing of its new Clinical Co-Development Fund at $582 million.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-10 15:25:24", "updated": "2021-05-10 16:22:09", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abingworth-raises-582-million-for-fund-supporting-late-stage-research", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "money_big-1.jpg", "image2id": "money_small-1.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Boardroom, Business Financing, Management, Research", "geography_tag": "UK", "company_tag": "Abingworth", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-10 16:22:00"}
