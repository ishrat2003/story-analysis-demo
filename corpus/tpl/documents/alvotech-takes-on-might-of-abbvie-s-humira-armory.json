Its global revenue last year was nearly $20 billion, though it has lost patent exclusivity in many countries outside the USA.</p>\n<h2>Promise of annual savings of up to $10 billion</h2>\n<p>Alvotech has developed a copy of the drug called AVT02, the first-filed biosimilar equal in strength to Humira&rsquo;s latest formulation, which AbbVie markets as a high-concentration, pain-free drug.</p>\n<p>The company is also developing AVT02 as an interchangeable product and expects results from its ongoing interchangeability study in the second quarter of this year.</p>\n<p>AVT02 could save US taxpayers and the overall healthcare system $8 to $10 billion annually, Alvotech claims.</p>\n<p>Founder and chairman Robert Wessman said: &ldquo;Our new product will be a gamechanger that will provide consumers who are suffering from chronic pain with significant savings, and we look forward to bringing this drug onto the market as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>AbbVie will seek to keep this competitor off the market with more than 60 patent claims protecting its exclusivity, though Alvotech has questioned their validity and says that they are part of a series of improper steps taken to inflate the firm&rsquo;s patent portfolio.</p>\n<h2>'Minefield of IP'</h2>\n<p>Biosimilars to Humira are available across Europe and in Japan, Canada and Australia. Settlement agreements that allowed launches in 2018 of copies in Europe were done to delay launches of similar products in the USA until 2023, allowing AbbVie to maintain and increase prices for US consumers and taxpayers.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, AbbVie has reported selling more than $75 billion worth of Humira and is forecast to make an additional sum of nearly $40 billion through 2022.</p>\n<p>Alvotech has called AbbVie&rsquo;s strategy a &ldquo;minefield of IP&rdquo;, meaning the company will engage in endless litigation not to protect innovation but to make challenges to its patent claims cost- and resource-prohibitive for competitors.</p>\n<p>AbbVie has not responded to The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s request for a comment.</p>", "date": "2021-05-12 12:49:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-12 12:17:25", "updated": "2021-05-12 12:50:34", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/alvotech-takes-on-might-of-abbvie-s-humira-armory", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "alvotech-large.jpg", "image2id": "alvotech-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Inflammatory diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Legal, Patents & Trademarks", "geography_tag": "Iceland, USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie, Alvotech", "drug_tag": "adalimumab, Humira", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-12 12:49:00"}
