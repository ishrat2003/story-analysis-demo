Other indications in rare diseases could also be developed by ValenzaBio. In parallel, Pierre Fabre is pursuing the development of its anti-IGF-1R ADC program (W0101) in oncology.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pierre Fabre's expertise in monoclonal antibody and on the IGF-1 biology led us to develop a compound with picomolar binding affinity and unique internalization properties. Based on these properties, this monoclonal antibody has the potential to be the best-in-class product for the treatment of TED. ValenzaBio has demonstrated an ability to apply thoughtful clinical and regulatory strategies to take oncology drugs into autoimmune and inflammatory settings. We are now delighted to work with the highly motivated team at ValenzaBio to bring this antibody to autoimmune patients with medical needs,&rdquo; said Nathalie Corvaia, head of immune-oncology research at Pierre Fabre.</p>\n<h2><strong>Terms of the accord</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the terms of the license and commercialization deal, Pierre Fabre will receive an upfront payment at signature, as well as additional development and sales milestone payments and will be eligible to receive royalties on future ValenzaBio sales. In addition, Pierre Fabre will make an equity investment in ValenzaBio.</p>\n<p>Under the planned partnership, Pierre Fabre will have the option to reclaim rights in territories outside North America upon completion of the proof-of-concept in the TED indication. Pierre Fabre in return would then pay ValenzaBio royalties on sales in these territories.</p>\n<p>TED is a debilitating auto-immune disease associated with eye orbital inflammation and tissue remodeling which can result in significant proptosis, and might lead to vision loss. Steroids are currently the first-line treatment but present several drawbacks complicating patient journey (lack of long-term efficacy, burden of administration scheme, promote comorbidities). Current evidence indicates that IGF-1R is a proven target of interest that can bring value to patients.</p>", "date": "2021-04-08 15:46:00", "meta_title": "Pierre Fabre and ValenzaBio collaborate on anti-IGF-1R antibody for TE", "meta_keywords": "Pierre Fabre, ValenzaBio, License, Agreement, Thyroid eye disease.
