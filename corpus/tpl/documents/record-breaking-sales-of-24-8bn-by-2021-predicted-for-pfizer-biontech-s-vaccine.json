It has also gained Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) in other geographies such as the USS, Canada, Australia and Switzerland.</p>\n<h2><strong>Improved storage requirements</strong></h2>\n<p>In February 2021, the FDA approved Comirnaty to be stored at temperatures ranging from -25&deg;C to -15&deg;C (-13&deg;F to 5&deg;F) for a total of two weeks, which is much higher than its previous storage requirement of -80&deg;C (-112&deg;F).</p>\n<p>Mr Horgan adds: &ldquo;This new temperature range places it on par with its rival, Moderna&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: MRNA) mRNA-1273. The temperature range also allows for greater flexibility in managing and maintaining Comirnaty&rsquo;s distribution and supply, and makes it more appealing to emerging markets, which do not have sufficient supercooling capacity.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It remains to be seen if Comirnaty&rsquo;s actual sales in 2021 will meet these forecast predictions. Several vaccines have received EUAs and approvals, including Moderna&rsquo;s mRNA-1273, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AN) AZD-1222, and Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) JNJ-7843673; these may take market share away from Comirnaty.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-04-15 11:05:00", "meta_title": "Record-breaking sales of $24.8bn by 2021 predicted for Pfizer/BioNTech", "meta_keywords": "Pfizer, BioNTech, Comirnaty, COVID-19, Vaccine, Sales, Forecast, GlobalData, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna", "meta_description": "Record-breaking sales of $24.8bn by 2021 predicted for Pfizer/BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-15 10:05:00", "updated": "2021-04-15 11:05:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/record-breaking-sales-of-24-8bn-by-2021-predicted-for-pfizer-biontech-s-vaccine", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biontech_vaccine_large.jpg", "image2id": "biontech_vaccine_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Markets & Marketing", "geography_tag": "Germany, Global, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlobalData, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Comirnaty, Tozinameran", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-15 11:05:00"}
