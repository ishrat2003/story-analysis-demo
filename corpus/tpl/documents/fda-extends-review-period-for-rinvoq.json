AbbVie responded to the request and the FDA will require additional time for a full review of the submission.</p>\n<p>Regulatory setbacks for drug applications from <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/regulatory-wobble-unnerves-acadia-backers\">Acadia Pharmaceuticals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/athenex-tanks-as-it-gets-crl-for-its-breast-cancer-combo-therapy\">Athenex</a> (Nasdaq: ATNX) and <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fibrogen-and-astrazeneca-s-roxadustat-to-face-fda-adcom\">FibroGen</a> (Nasdaq: FGEN) have caught Wall Street flat-footed in the past month alone, as analysts debate whether the FDA is getting more conservative over approvals, commented Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli wrote that peak yearly sales hopes of $8 billion for Rinvoq would be &ldquo;severely hampered&rdquo; if the medicine gets a strict warning for the threat of blood clots as has Pfizer&rsquo;s (NYSE: PFE) Xeljanz (tofacitinib). Global net revenues for Rinvoq in full year 2020 were $731 million.</p>\n<h2><strong>Similar request for use in atopic dermatitis</strong></h2>\n<p>Separately, AbbVie received a similar request from the FDA related to the sNDA for upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis, which is being prepared and will be submitted to the FDA shortly.</p>\n<p>\"We remain confident in the sNDA and are committed to working with the FDA to bring upadacitinib to patients living with psoriatic arthritis and other immune-mediated diseases,\" said Dr Michael Severino, vice chairman and president, AbbVie.</p>\n<p>Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, Rinvoq is an oral, once daily, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. It was engineered to have greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 versus JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2.</p>\n<p>In August 2019, Rinvoq received FDA approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. It is also approved by the European Commission.</p>", "date": "2021-03-17 17:45:00", "meta_title": "FDA extends review period for Rinvoq sNDA", "meta_keywords": "AbbVie, Rinvoq, sNDA, Review, Extended, Psoriatic arthritis, Atopic dermatitis", "meta_description": "FDA extends review period for Rinvoq sNDA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-17 17:44:42", "updated": "2021-03-17 17:52:08", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-extends-review-period-for-rinvoq", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "abbvie_headquarters_large.jpg", "image2id": "abbvie_headquarters_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Dermatologicals", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AbbVie", "drug_tag": "Rinvoq", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-17 17:45:00"}
