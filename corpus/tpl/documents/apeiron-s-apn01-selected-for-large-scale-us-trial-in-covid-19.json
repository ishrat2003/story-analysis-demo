The trial is anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2021. The trial is largely funded by public grants.</p>\n<p>APEIRON&rsquo;s recently completed Phase II trial showed significant improvement in certain parameters of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) with APN01 treatment compared to placebo. Data also suggested that APN01 will confer greatest therapeutic benefit to patients with lower WHO scores. The randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled ACTIV-4d RAAS trial will enroll approximately 1,600 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, at more than 50 individual sites. APN01 will be one of at least three agents to be evaluated in the trial.</p>\n<h2><strong>&ldquo;Opens the US and international markets&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;The ACTIV-4d RAAS trial perfectly fits our strategy to address larger patient populations and various disease states based on our recent convincing results. Administering APN01 earlier in the course of COVID-19 potentially protects patients from progressing to a severe stage of the disease with uncontrollable inflammation and organ damage,&rdquo; said chief executive Peter Llewellyn-Davies, adding: &ldquo;We are confident that this Phase II US trial will confirm the clinical benefits of APN01 in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and opens the US and international markets for our promising drug candidate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In parallel to the US clinical trial with APN01 as intravenous application, APEIRON is preparing a company-sponsored Phase I trial to evaluate drug delivery of APN01 through inhalation in order to target all infected or at-risk patients earlier in the course of the disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additonally, an improved manufacturing process for a commercially viable mass scale production of good manufacturing practice (GMP) material of APN01 is under preparation.</p>\n<p>In order to secure funding of the company&rsquo;s next development steps, APEIRON will initiate a financing round within the next months.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-19 15:43:00", "meta_title": "APEIRON\u00e2\u0080\u0099s APN01 selected for large-scale US trial in COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "APEIRON Biologics, APN01, Alunacedase alfa, US trial, COVID-19, NIH, ACTIV", "meta_description": "APEIRON\u00e2\u0080\u0099s APN01 selected for large-scale US trial in COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-19 15:42:16", "updated": "2021-05-19 15:51:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/apeiron-s-apn01-selected-for-large-scale-us-trial-in-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "apeiron_large.png", "image2id": "apeiron_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Austria, USA", "company_tag": "APEIRON Biologics AG", "drug_tag": "alunacedase alfa, APN01", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-19 15:43:00"}
