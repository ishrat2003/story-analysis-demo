Merck and Ridgeback said that, although the study remained blinded, none of the four serious adverse events seen in the trial were deemed related to molnupiravir.</p>\n<p>Separately, Evercore ISI&rsquo;s Umer Raffat noted that some virologists had expressed concerns about molnupiravir&rsquo;s mutagenic mechanism. Merck and Ridgeback also said on Saturday that animal studies, in which the project was given for longer and at higher doses than in human trials, suggested that molnupiravir was not mutagenic or genotoxic.</p>\n<p>Another big question, noted Ms Armstrong, is whether the latest data will translate into a benefit on harder endpoints such as reductions in hospitalizations and death. This is exactly what Merck&rsquo;s upcoming trials, <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04575584\">MK-4482-001</a>&nbsp;in the hospital setting and <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04575597\">MK-4482-002</a>&nbsp;in the outpatient setting, are looking to show.</p>\n<p>In hospitalized patients the bar for molnupiravir, albeit not a very high one, has been set by Gilead&rsquo;s intravenous antiviral Veklury, which is FDA-approved despite fairly unimpressive results, she said.</p>\n<h2><strong>CytoDyn tries to squeeze positive news out of a failed Covid-19 study</strong></h2>\n<p>CytoDyn really, really wanted to put its best foot forward, said Amber Tong on Endpoints News. So much so that, after sitting on unblinded <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-iii-trial-for-leronlimab-in-covid-19-patients-disappoints\">Phase IIb/III data on Vyrologix</a> (leronlimab) in Covid-19 for two weeks pending regulatory discussions, the biotech issued six press releases over the weekend, each offering a little more information or refining what was previously disclosed.</p>\n<p>In one of them, CytoDyn acknowledged that leronlimab - an anti-CCR5 antibody that had already been turned away at the FDA&rsquo;s doorsteps once - had failed the primary endpoint of lowering all-cause mortality at Day 28, as the result was not statistically significant. At best, execs implied, they would need to collect further clinical data to be ready for regulatory reviews.</p>\n<p>Further massaging the data, execs pointed out that there were more over-65 patients taking leronlimab than placebo &mdash; leading them to conduct a post hoc &ldquo;age adjustment&rdquo; analysis and deduce &ldquo;statistically-significant results (p-value = 0.0319)&rdquo; for the primary endpoint &ldquo;in participants receiving leronlimab + &lsquo;commonly used COVID-19 treatments&rsquo; compared to participants who received &lsquo;commonly used COVID-19 treatments&rsquo; alone in the placebo group in the overall modified intent-to-treat (&lsquo;mITT&rsquo;) population.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>CytoDyn claimed it&rsquo;s gotten regulators on board with the subgroup hypothesis: The UK&rsquo;s MHRA is apparently willing to accept data from the open-label extension of the study, which has enrolled 45 so far. The US agency is asking for data from 140 more patients in the critically ill population, with the new primary endpoint of length of hospital stay (according to CytoDyn, leronlimab had shortened time to recovery by six days among these patients compared to placebo plus standard of care only, with a p-value of 0.005). In Canada, the company will apply to start selling the drug while clinical trials continue &mdash; with unclear prospects.</p>\n<h2><strong>bluebird bio: Lenti partial exoneration incrementally positive, but not thesis&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>RBC Analyst Luca Issi on Wednesday released a client note on bluebird bio in reaction to the biotech company&rsquo;s new analyses that it was very unlikely its gene therapy had a link with a <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bluebird-bio-says-very-unlikely-aml-events-are-linked-to-its-gene-therapy\">case of acute myeloid leukemia</a> (AML) in a clinical trial patient.</p>\n<p><u>Changing Impact:</u>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Incrementally Positive - We think the update on the two new cases of AML/MDS is incrementally positive given no obvious evidence of insertional oncogenesis, but we remain on the side-lines as we still see an uphill battle with the regulators and commercial adoption.</p>\n<p><u>AML Case Unlikely Caused By Lenti, MDS Case Still Under Investigation - </u>Findings shared today suggest it is unlikely that lenti played a role in the AML case, as the site of integration occurred within an intron (non-coding region) of a gene not associated with oncogenesis (VAMP4). The second case of MDS is still under investigation as it is unclear whether the clinical findings (prolonged anemia/trisomy of 8) meet the criteria of MDS given no blast/dysplastic cells observed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Lenti Exoneration Incrementally Positive, But We Still See Uphill Battle</u> - We think the update is incrementally positive as it clears lenti from direct causation at least in one of the two new cases. However, we remain on the side-lines given we see an uphill battle with the regulators (we have 3 cases of AML/MDS out of 44 patients, substantially higher than what historical literature would suggest for SCD patients link1, link2) and commercial adoption (our KOL thinks he will use gene therapy in 3-5% of patients if ultimately approved vs the 5-10% he envisioned before the setback, link).</p>\n<p>Adding his voice, Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Jacob Plieth said bluebird had largely ruled out the role of its lentivirus in an AML case that has caused LentiGlobin sickle cell trials to be halted, but there was another vital snippet of information in today&rsquo;s analyst call on the matter. This concerned the possible role of busulfan preconditioning &ndash; separately posited as a possible cause of the AML &ndash; which now too has apparently been ruled out.</p>\n<p>On the call, seemingly convened to formalize what <a href=\"https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/snippets/bluebird-sings-select-group-investors\">the company had controversially told an investor conference two weeks ago</a>, bluebird&rsquo;s chief medical officer, Dave Davidson, said vector was present in the AML blasts. This suggested that these cells were not in the patient during preconditioning so, barring a role for residual busulfan, preconditioning was not to blame. This is important for the entire gene therapy field, which frequently uses busulfan with lentiviral gene transfer.</p>\n<h2><strong>AVEO Oncology gets the long-awaited greenlight to market tivozanib </strong></h2>\n<p>Seven years after AVEO Oncology&rsquo;s tivozanib was subjected to a scathing dressdown by the FDA&rsquo;s cancer czar Richard Pazdur - followed by a swift rejection and a bumping road toward refiling - the tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/long-awaited-fda-approval-for-aveo-oncology-s-fotivda\">approved for relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma, commented Amber Tong writing on Endpoints News.</a> Known for over a decade as tivo, the drug will now be marketed as Fotivda.</p>\n<p>It was a much narrower label than what they had initially sought, but the approval marked the best news the Boston biotech has put out in years. Shares shot up 89.11% to $15.28 soon after the announcement hit the wires, and then some more in after-market trading.</p>\n<p>The OK, though, sets off a scramble to make the most out of the drug before its US patent expires in 2022. Aveo said it&rsquo;s applying for a patent term extension to stretch it out to 2027.</p>\n<p>AVEO had been touting data from a pivotal Phase III trial that they said suggested tivozanib could be a next-gen treatment for kidney cancer by blocking all three VEGF receptors. What they didn&rsquo;t tell investors, though, was that the FDA had in fact recommended a new trial, raising concerns about the trial design (it was so flawed, they said, it was hard to determine how toxic the drug was) and disappointment over the proposed label.</p>\n<p>Those issues were only blown open when the agency convened an expert panel to examine them. Most notably, regulators revealed that while tivozanib improved disease-free progression by 20%, it also increased the risk of death by 25%.</p>\n<p>They ended up conducting a new trial, TIVO-3, comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. AVEO ultimately filed with the FDA in 2020 and promised that if the final analysis pointed to a final OS harvard ratio over 1.00, they would withdraw the NDA.</p>\n<p>Anyone looking at AVEO&rsquo;s 89% share price surge last Wednesday might assume that US approval of the group&rsquo;s kidney cancer drug Fotivda marked a turnaround in the struggling company&rsquo;s commercial prospects, according to Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>Such hope is misplaced: AVEO&rsquo;s Fotivda&rsquo;s patent life ends soon. But the approval, 21 days before the FDA&rsquo;s action date, is an odd example of generosity on the part of a regulator seen recently as getting tough.</p>\n<p>Its journey was long and tortuous, and the supporting study, Tivo-3, had begun five years ago. This is crucially important, as the kidney cancer landscape has changed significantly in the meantime, seeing anti-PD-1 therapy move front line, first combined with Yervoy and then with Inlyta or Cabometyx, and older therapies relegated.</p>", "date": "2021-03-14 10:30:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 12, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Merck & Co, Ridgeback, Molnupiravir, CytoDyn, Vyrologix, Lerontimab, bluebird bio, LentiGlobin, AVEO Oncology, Fotivda, Tivozanib", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 12, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-14 10:28:46", "updated": "2021-03-15 09:07:49", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-12-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Infectious diseases, Oncology", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "AVEO Oncology, bluebird bio, CytoDyn, Merck & Co, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics", "drug_tag": "Fotivda, LentiGlobin, leronlimab, molnupiravir, tivozanib, Vyrologix", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-14 10:30:00"}
