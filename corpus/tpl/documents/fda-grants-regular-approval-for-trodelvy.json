The FDA approved this application six weeks ahead of the FDA goal date.</p>\n<p>The FDA granted the approval to Immunomedics, which had already won accelerated approval for Trodelvy in April 2020, to treat adult patients with metastatic TNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. The drug generated sales of $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>\n<h2><strong>$4 billion peak sales projected</strong></h2>\n<p>US biotech major Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) gained rights to Trodelvy through its $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics in September last year. Cowan analyst Phil Nadeau said Trodelvy is expected to have $4 billion in peak sales.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s approval is the culmination of a multi-year development program and validates the clinical benefit of this important treatment in metastatic TNBC,&rdquo; said Dr Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer at Gilead Sciences. &ldquo;Building upon this milestone, we are committed to advancing Trodelvy with worldwide regulatory authorities so that, pending their decision, Trodelvy may become available to many more people around the world who are facing this difficult-to-treat cancer.&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Regulatory submissions for Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC have been filed in the UK, Canada, Switzerland and Australia as part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners, as well as in Singapore through partner Everest Medicines. The European Medicines Agency has also validated a Marketing Authorization Application for Trodelvy in the European Union. All filings are based on data from the Phase III ASCENT study.</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>Efficacy and safety were evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial (ASCENT; NCT02574455) conducted in 529 patients with unresectable locally advanced or mTNBC who had relapsed after at least two prior chemotherapies, one of which could be in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, if progression occurred within 12 months. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive sacituzumab govitecan, 10mg/kg as an intravenous infusion, on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day (n=267) cycle or physician&rsquo;s choice of single agent chemotherapy (n=262).</p>", "date": "2021-04-08 10:32:00", "meta_title": "FDA grants regular approval for Trodelvy", "meta_keywords": "Gilead Sciences, Immunomedics, Trodelvy, Cancer, Breast, mTNBC, Approval, FDA", "meta_description": "FDA grants regular approval for Trodelvy", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-08 10:30:59", "updated": "2021-04-08 10:38:44", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-grants-regular-approval-for-trodelvy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "gilead-big.jpg", "image2id": "gilead-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Immunomedics", "drug_tag": "Trodelvy", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-08 10:32:00"}
