SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.</p>\n<p>Swiss pharma giant Roche entered the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-forking-out-1-3-billion-on-aav-capsids-deal\">partnership in December 2019</a>, when it paid Sarepta an upfront $750 million in cash and $400 million in equity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are delighted by these seminal results from the ENDEAVOR Study, our first trial results with SRP-9001 made by our commercial-scale manufacturing process. These data show strong transduction of the micro-dystrophin gene, resulting in robust expression of the properly localized micro-dystrophin protein, and did so with no new or unexpected safety signals,&rdquo; said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive of Sarepta. &ldquo;In addition to characterizing and differentiating SRP-9001, these results confirm the extraordinary work done over the last two and a half years to build an at-scale gene therapy manufacturing process and corresponding analytics sufficient to meet the needs of the Duchenne population with what we believe will be a potentially life-changing therapy. Armed with these data, we will seek a meeting with the FDA with the goal of rapidly starting our registrational study,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>\n<p>In the open-label study, 20 participants between the ages of four and seven were treated with a single infusion of SRP-9001 at a dose of 1.33x10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg. In muscle biopsies from the first 11 patients taken 12 weeks after treatment, the following results were observed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All patients demonstrated robust transduction, with mean micro-dystrophin expression of 55.4% of normal, as measured by western blot.</li>\n<li>Muscle dystrophin levels demonstrated a mean of 70.5% (baseline 12.8%) muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin at 12 weeks with a mean intensity at the sarcolemma of 116.9% (baseline 41.0%) compared to normal biopsies, as measured by immunofluorescence. Comparisons between baseline and post-treatment measures were statistically significant (p=0.001 for positive fibers, and p=0.002 for intensity).</li>\n<li>Mean vector genome copies per nucleus reached 3.87.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The safety profile of SRP-9001 observed in the first 11 participants in ENDEAVOR is consistent with the safety seen in earlier studies using clinical manufacturing process material. In line with previously reported clinical data, no clinically relevant complement activation was observed in these 11 patients. Two patients experienced serious adverse events (transaminase elevation in one patient and nausea and vomiting in a second patient) that fully resolved.</p>", "date": "2021-05-19 11:11:00", "meta_title": "Early-stage trial shows positive profile for Sarepta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DMD candidate S", "meta_keywords": "Sarepta Therapeutics, SRP-9001, DMD, Muscular dystrophy, Duchenne, Roche,", "meta_description": "Early-stage trial shows positive profile for Sarepta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DMD candidate SRP-9001", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-19 11:10:31", "updated": "2021-05-19 11:18:47", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/early-stage-trial-shows-positive-profile-for-sarepta-s-dmd-candidate-srp-9001", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "sarepta-big.jpg", "image2id": "sarepta-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Muscular dystrophy", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Roche, Sarepta Therapeutics", "drug_tag": "SRP-9001", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-19 11:11:00"}
