The new facility will have an&nbsp;area of approximately 27,500 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>The investment will increase large-scale biologics manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand in the contract manufacturing space. The state-of-the-art, high throughput facility includes perfusion capabilities and is designed to support high titer processes and accommodate the next generation of mammalian biologics.</p>\n<p>In Portsmouth, a new next-generation facility supporting late-phase clinical and commercial development and manufacturing will add capacity for up to eight 2,000L single-use bioreactors over an area of 3,000 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>This 200 million-franc expansion will help meet the increasing market demand for small- to mid-scale mammalian-derived biologics and support the implementation of high titer and high throughput platform processes.</p>\n<p>The facility is designed to support Phase III clinical and commercial small- to mid-volume products. It will include state-of-the-art technologies in perfusion, purification, and automation.</p>\n<p>Combined with Lonza&rsquo;s industry-leading services in process characterization and process validation, the facility will offer customers an optimized path through Biological License Application (BLA) to market as well as the flexibility to meet challenges in product forecasting during the initial years of product launch.</p>\n<p>The facility is expected to be completed in 2023 and will complement the existing single-use network at Lonza sites in Hayward (USA), Slough (UK), Tuas (SG) and Visp.</p>", "date": "2021-05-06 15:44:00", "meta_title": "Lonza expands manufacturing in Visp (Switz) and Portsmouth (USA)", "meta_keywords": "Lonza, Manufacturing, Expansion, Mammalian drug, Visp, Portsmouth", "meta_description": "Lonza expands manufacturing in Visp (Switz) and Portsmouth (USA)", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-06 15:43:40", "updated": "2021-05-06 15:51:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lonza-expands-manufacturing-in-visp-switz-and-portsmouth-usa", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "lonza_big.png", "image2id": "lonza_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Outsourcing, CRO and CMO, Production", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Lonza", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-06 15:44:00"}
