A manuscript of the trial&rsquo;s data is being prepared and will be submitted for publication in one or more major medical journals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Highlights from the trial&rsquo;s data for this critically ill population include the following:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Survival benefit</u>: There was a 24% reduction in all-cause mortality (primary endpoint of the study) in the leronlimab versus placebo.</li>\n<li><u>Shortened time to recovery</u>: The average length of hospital stay was reduced by six days for patients who received leronlimab with Standard of Care (SoC) compared to placebo patients who received SoC only, with a statistically significant p-value of 0.005.</li>\n<li><u>Discharge alive</u>: In addition, patients who received leronlimab demonstrated an improved probability of \"discharged alive\" at Day 28 (28% versus 11%), a 166% better rate than in the placebo group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the size of this critically ill population relative to the trial&rsquo;s size (62 out of 384 patients), the company has concurrently filed an additional protocol with the FDA using the existing sites from its CD12 trial to quickly enroll patients in this population during the pendency of these ongoing regulatory discussions. CytoDyn has continued to enroll patients (45) through the open-label arm of the CD12 trial and is working with regulators here and abroad to expedite this process.</p>\n<p>Nader Pourhassan, president and chief executive of CytoDyn, commented: &ldquo;Today, there are no approved drugs to effectively address the unmet medical need for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our CD12 study demonstrates leronlimab is particularly effective in treating this patient population. We believe these results are the best results ever achieved for this population in a Phase III clinical trial. A recently approved IL-6 blocker used to treat severe to critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, reduced mortality by 2% compared to the placebo group. In contrast, leronlimab demonstrated a reduction of 24% in mortality compared to the SoC treated group, which is 12 times better in reducing all-cause mortality for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The company is very excited about these results and is concurrently working with regulators here and abroad to expedite leronlimab&rsquo;s approval to treat COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-09 11:19:00", "meta_title": "Phase III trial for leronlimab in COVID-19 patients disappoints", "meta_keywords": "CytoDyn, Vyrologix, Leronlimab, Phase III, COVID-19 patients", "meta_description": "Phase III trial for leronlimab in COVID-19 patients disappoints", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 11:18:05", "updated": "2021-03-09 12:06:46", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-iii-trial-for-leronlimab-in-covid-19-patients-disappoints", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cytodyn_big.jpg", "image2id": "cytodyn_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Canada, USA", "company_tag": "CytoDyn", "drug_tag": "leronlimab, Vyrologix", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-09 11:19:00"}
