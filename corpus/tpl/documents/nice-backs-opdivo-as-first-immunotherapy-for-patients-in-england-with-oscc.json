Surgery to remove the cancer or tumour has been unsuccessful or is not an option for patients diagnosed with unresectable advanced OSCC.<sup>7 </sup>The current primary cancer treatment for OSCC is chemotherapy, with 45% of patients receiving it as part of their curative or palliative cancer treatment. With the availability of nivolumab on the NHS, OSCC patients in England will now have access to an alternative treatment when chemotherapy fails.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Patients with unresectable advanced oesophageal squamous cell cancer have been waiting for this approval for a long time and it&rsquo;s excellent to see that NICE has now made the decision to provide immunotherapy as an alternative treatment, when chemotherapy fails.&rdquo; said Julie Harrington, chief executive, Guts UK. &ldquo;This positive step provides new optimism to patients and their families.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>\n<p>This NICE recommendation is supported by three-year data from the Phase III randomized ATTRACTION-3 study, which demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival and a favorable safety profile with nivolumab compared to taxane chemotherapy (CT). The median overall survival was 10.91 months with nivolumab versus 8.51 months with CT. The overall survival rates of patients with nivolumab and CT were 20.2% and 13.5% at 24 months, and 15.3% and 8.7% at 36 months respectively. No new safety signals were detected during the three-year follow-up.</p>", "date": "2021-05-13 13:53:00", "meta_title": "NICE backs Opdivo as first immunotherapy for patients in England with", "meta_keywords": "Bristol Myers Squibb, Opdivo, NICE, Recommendation, NHS, Cancer, Oesophageal, Squamous cell, OSCC", "meta_description": "NICE backs Opdivo as first immunotherapy for patients in England with OSCC", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-13 13:52:16", "updated": "2021-05-13 13:59:25", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nice-backs-opdivo-as-first-immunotherapy-for-patients-in-england-with-oscc", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "opdivo__bristol-myers_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "opdivo_bristol-myers_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Cancer immunotherapy", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Bristol-Myers Squibb", "drug_tag": "Opdivo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-13 13:53:00"}
