A recent IQVIA report on The Impact of Biosimilar Competition in Europe, highlighted the critical role that biosimilar medicines will play in the future as many more biological medicines are set to lose market (IP) exclusivity.</p>\n<p>This should compel the European Union and member states to implement efficient, goal-oriented biosimilar medicine policies to improve patient access and healthcare sustainability. This should be based on highly successful benefit-sharing models that have proven the ability to stimulate competition and uptake.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the launch of the Biosimilar Market Review, Kelly Burke, chair of the biosimilar market access committee of Medicines for Europe said: &ldquo;The Biosimilar Market Review is an important resource for stakeholders and policy-makers interested in improving access to biological therapies. While progress has been made, it is clear much more can be done to leverage benefit-sharing for better access for patients and for a more sustainable healthcare.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The 2020 Biosimilar market re</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 10:13:00", "meta_title": "New report views progress on biosimilar medicine policies across Europ", "meta_keywords": "Biosimilars, Medicines, Policies, Competition, Access", "meta_description": "New report views progress on biosimilar medicine policies across Europe", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 09:03:16", "updated": "2021-03-31 10:13:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-report-views-progress-on-biosimilar-medicine-policies-across-europe", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "biosimilars_samples_large.jpg", "image2id": "biosimilars_samples_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": "All therapy areas", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Government Affairs, Markets & Marketing, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Europe", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 10:13:00"}
