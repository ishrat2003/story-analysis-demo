It is the third coronavirus jab to be rolled out in the country, following on from those produced by Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX), and AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN).</p>\n<p>The UK has bought 17 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, and Phase III results suggest it has 100% efficacy against severe cases. Along with the Pfizer jab, it will be offered to British people aged under 30 years as an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been linked with cases of blood clots and so has a more marginal risk versus benefit profile in that age group.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Shutterstock</a></p>", "date": "2021-04-07 16:01:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "COVID-, months, vaccine, dose, Moderna, research, activity, antibody, antibodies, persist, published, high, groups, remained, England, Journal, Medicine", "meta_description": "Antibody activity remained high in all age groups beyond six months after the second dose of Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine, according to research published in the ", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-07 15:45:42", "updated": "2021-04-07 16:33:15", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/antibodies-persist-six-months-after-second-moderna-covid-19-jab", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "moderna_credit_shutterstock_large.jpg", "image2id": "moderna_credit_shutterstock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna Therapeutics, New England Journal, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-07 16:01:00"}
