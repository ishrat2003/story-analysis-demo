Up to 90% of people living with CF worldwide have at least one F508del mutation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are delighted the TGA has approved Trikafta for eligible people living with CF in Australia and will continue working with the Australian government to bring this important medicine to patients as quickly as possible,&rdquo; said Dr Reshma Kewalramani, chief executive and president of Vertex. &ldquo;It is our goal to develop and provide treatments for all people with CF around the world, and today is another significant milestone on that journey,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>CF affects approximately 3,500 people in Australia. It is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene.</p>\n<p>Trikafta is already by far the best-selling drug for Vertex, generating revenues of $3.86 billion for full-year 2020.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trikafta targets underlying cause of the disease</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Cystic fibrosis is a complex, progressive, devastating disease that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. It is a condition that significantly affects not only the patient, but also those who care for them, with people living with cystic fibrosis spending multiple hours every day on treatment and requiring daily care from a family member or loved one,&rdquo; said Professor John Wilson AM, head of Cystic Fibrosis Service, Alfred Health. &ldquo;The approval of any new treatment option for people living with cystic fibrosis is always welcome news. This new treatment is for patients ages 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation and means more patients can potentially benefit from a medicine that targets the underlying cause of the disease, for the first time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The TGA approval of Trikafta was based on the results of four global Phase III studies, which included multiple trial sites and patients from Australia, the company noted.</p>", "date": "2021-03-25 14:44:00", "meta_title": "Australian approval for Vertex\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Trikafta", "meta_keywords": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Trikafta, Cystic fibrosis, Approval, TGA", "meta_description": "Australian approval for Vertex\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Trikafta", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-25 14:43:23", "updated": "2021-03-25 14:57:00", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/australian-approval-for-vertex-trikafta", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vertex_large.jpg", "image2id": "vertex_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Cystic fibrosis, Therapeutic Goods Administration", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Rare diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Australia, USA", "company_tag": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "Trikafta", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-25 14:44:00"}
