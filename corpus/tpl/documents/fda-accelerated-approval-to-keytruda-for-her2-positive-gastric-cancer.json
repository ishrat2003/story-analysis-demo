For patients who received trastuzumab and chemotherapy alone, the complete response rate was 3.1% and the partial response rate was 49%.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s approval marks an important milestone, as this is the first time an anti-PD-1 therapy has been approved in combination with anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for these patients,&rdquo; said Dr Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. &ldquo;From the start of Keytruda&rsquo;s development, we have thoughtfully pursued novel combinations to help more patients with cancer. We are pleased to bring a new first-line combination regimen with Keytruda that has shown meaningful improvement in ORR over standard treatment to patients with HER2-positive gastric and GEJ cancer,&rdquo; he added.</p>", "date": "2021-05-06 10:14:00", "meta_title": "FDA accelerated approval to Keytruda for HER2-positive gastric cancer", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, Keytruda, Cancer, Gastric, HER2-positive, FDA, Approval", "meta_description": "FDA accelerated approval to Keytruda for HER2-positive gastric cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-06 09:11:58", "updated": "2021-05-06 10:14:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accelerated-approval-to-keytruda-for-her2-positive-gastric-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "keytruda_large-1--1.jpg", "image2id": "keytruda_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Gastroenterology, Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co", "drug_tag": "Keytruda", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-06 10:14:00"}
