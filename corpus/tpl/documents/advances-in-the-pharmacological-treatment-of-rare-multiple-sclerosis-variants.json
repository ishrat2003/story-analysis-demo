Although the rarity of these diseases restricts the research and development of disease-specific therapies, some progress has been made. In this exclusive article, Dr Davies investigates this progress.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tumefactive MS</strong></h2>\n<p>Patients with this condition typically present with large tumor-like lesions. The first-line treatment for this condition is corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone, although plasma exchange has been shown to be effective in some cases. In patients with severe clinical deficits who did not respond to either of these treatments, cyclophosphamide has been found to be effective and well-tolerated.<sup>1</sup> In contrast, in a recent case report of a patient with both tumefactive and Marburg-type lesions, immunosuppression with high doses of cyclophosphamide controlled the disease for only seven months.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Long-term treatment consists of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) used in typical MS, such as glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. However, natalizumab and fingolimod have been reported to worsen lesions and so should be avoided.<sup>2</sup> Glatiramer acetate has been found to be effective in the short term, but not in the long run.<sup>3</sup> Indeed, for this condition, the use of DMTs for preventing a relapse remains highly debated. According to various experts, DMT use is dependent on the following risk factors: age at disease onset, history of a disabling first attack, enhancement pattern, and presence of typical MS lesions.</p>\n<p>To improve prognosis, stronger immunosuppressive strategies, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, need to be evaluated. Additionally, risk assessment of relapse needs to be improved for enabling quick decisions regarding the best course of treatment, including the need for DMTs.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Balo&rsquo;s concentric sclerosis (BCS)</strong></h2>\n<p>This condition is characterized by concentric patterns of demyelinated regions alternating with undamaged myelin. Therapies include corticosteroids, plasma exchange, immunoglobulin, and drugs such as cyclophosphamide.<sup>4</sup> A 2020 report on eight patients with BCS suggests this condition is heterogenous. Clinicians might need to consider the radiological features of the disease and response to immunotherapies in each individual when deciding an effective course of treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Certain patients with BCS also present with typical MS lesions. Initial treatment with high doses of corticosteroids is recommended for this group, but poor responders to steroids could be treated with rituximab. In contrast, in patients with BCS who do not present typical MS lesions, the initial corticosteroid treatment needs to be followed by immediate immunosuppression. This is because activated macrophages play an important role in the development of demyelinating BCS lesions. Cyclophosphamide is considered the only agent that can effectively suppress this type of inflammation and control the disease. Plasma exchange was not found to be effective in these patients. Interferon beta-1a, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and fingolimod may be more beneficial in the former group of patients than in individuals who present with BCS lesions alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Marburg&rsquo;s disease</strong></h2>\n<p>This is an aggressive form of MS that progresses rapidly, leading to death. Although acute disease is typically treated using high doses of methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and immunoglobulin,<sup>5</sup> corticosteroids and plasma exchange are usually not effective. Strongly immunosuppressive therapy may be required. The immunosuppressants mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and alemtuzumab have been successful in previously reported cases. Regardless, the outcome of cyclophosphamide treatment is inconsistent across different cases, possibly because of variations in the treatment protocol.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>A recent case report described a patient with Marburg&rsquo;s disease who did not respond to the abovementioned therapies.<sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, the condition of this patient was stabilized with natalizumab, which has previously exhibited high efficacy and short-term safety even in aggressive forms of MS. Additionally, the patient showed both clinical and imagiological improvement that was sustained for 12 months. This is a noteworthy development considering that Marburg&rsquo;s disease is typically associated with rapid progression and a fatal outcome. However, natalizumab treatment is associated with a risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which increases with treatment duration and immunosuppression. Therefore, despite its high efficacy, long-term treatment with natalizumab may not be a viable option.</p>\n<h2><strong>Schilder&rsquo;s disease</strong></h2>\n<p>Schilder&rsquo;s disease is a progressive condition presenting with one or two extensive demyelinating lesions in the centrum ovale. Treatment with high doses of steroids has been reported to be effective. Immunomodulatory therapeutics used in typical MS may be used, particularly in patients exhibiting oligoclonal bands (a hallmark of MS) and in cases where the distinction between Schilder&rsquo;s disease and typical MS is unclear. However, further evidence is required for establishing concrete guidelines on the treatment of this disease.<sup> 6</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Pediatric-onset MS</strong></h2>\n<p>MS is rare in the pediatric population. However, due to the development of disability over the course of the disease, early diagnosis and treatment initiation is critical. Advancements in research have enabled earlier diagnosis and administration of highly efficacious DMTs at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, the number of DMTs available for these patients has increased. Common first-line treatments include fingolimod, which is the only FDA-approved drug for pediatric-onset MS; interferons; and glatiramer acetate. Other effective treatments are dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide.<sup> 7</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clinicians are aiming to achieve a state of no clinical relapse, no disease progression, no new MRI activity, no cognitive decline, and no evidence of brain atrophy (NEDA-4). This goal can be realized through the development of therapies with higher efficacy.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Future directions</strong></h2>\n<p>Currently, the treatment of rare variants of MS tend to be based on strategies used in typical MS and evidence from case reports. For the successful management of these rare forms of MS, it is important to develop therapeutics and conduct large clinical trials for specific MS variants. This will help identify biomarkers for early differential diagnosis and treatment prognosis, as well establish standard treatment guidelines for these conditions.</p>\n<p>IMAGE: rare_diseases_credit_depositphotos.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fereidan-Esfahani, M. and Tobin, W.
