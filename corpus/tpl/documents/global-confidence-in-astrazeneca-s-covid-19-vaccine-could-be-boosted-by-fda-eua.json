However, initial interim results made public on March 22, showed that it was 79% effective.</p>\n<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s infectious diseases analyst Arafa Salam commented: &ldquo;Although there is not a significant difference between 79% and 76%, the fact that AstraZeneca had to revise its data meant that AZD1222 fueled doubt among the public. This was made worse by the reports of people developing unusual blood clots, which affected 37 out of roughly 17 million people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite this rare development, the safety data for AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccine were reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Although the majority of the 20 countries that suspended use of the vaccine resumed use after the EMA concluded that the vaccine was safe, some countries such as Norway extended their suspensions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AstraZeneca must regain public trust if it is to be a greater contender in the COVID-19 vaccine space. An EUA authorization win might just be the ticket and boost usage globally. The US will utilize some of its doses, but also has plans to send four million doses to Canada and Mexico on loan deals between the two countries. Canada will receive 1.5 million doses and Mexico will receive 2.5 million doses,&rdquo; Dr Salam concluded.</p>", "date": "2021-04-16 12:22:00", "meta_title": "Global confidence in AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine could be boosted b", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, AZD1222, Confidence, Emergency use, EUA, FDA, GlobalData", "meta_description": "Global confidence in AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine could be boosted by FDA EUA", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-16 09:09:20", "updated": "2021-04-16 12:22:54", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/global-confidence-in-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-boosted-by-fda-eua", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_large.png", "image2id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Public health, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca, GlobalData", "drug_tag": "AZD1222, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-16 12:22:00"}
