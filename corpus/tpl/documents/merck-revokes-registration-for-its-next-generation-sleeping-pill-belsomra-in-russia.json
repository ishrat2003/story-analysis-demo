It was approved in the USA and the European Union in 2014, while in Russia suvorexant was cleared in 2016. According to Russian pharma analytics agency DSM Group, during the validity of the registration certificate in Russia, not a single pack of the drug was sold in the Russian market. For four years, the drug has not been included in the list of vital and essential in Russia, which prevented selling at its maximum selling price.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Cost deterrent to uptake</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the Russian Kommersant business paper, which cites some leading Russian psychiatrists, the main reason for the poor uptake of MSD&rsquo;s Belsomra in Russia was the high cost of the drug. Setting such a high price for the drug could be primarily explained by the lack of side effects, which are typical for other drugs widely used in Russia for the treatment of insomnia. Among such drugs are usually the so-called Z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon) that have replaced benzodiazepines.</p>\n<p>Sergei Shulyak, DSM Group&rsquo;s chief executive said in an interview with Kommersant, another reason for suspension of sales of Belsomra in Russia was the current Russian legislation regulating the release and storage of such drugs in the local market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to him, currently not all pharmacies are ready to bear the costs of organizing the turnover of psychotropic drugs, given the limited volume of their sales. In 2020, the commercial turnover of prescription sleeping pills in Russia amounted to about 1% of the total value of drugs sold in this group, or 107.6 million roubles (~$1.5 million).</p>\n<p>Due to strict sales rules, even Z-drugs of the old generation and benzodiazepines are currently sold in Russia in limited volumes. As a result, the problem of insomnia for Russian patients is usually solved with the help of antihistamines.</p>", "date": "2021-05-18 12:26:00", "meta_title": "Merck revokes registration for its next-generation sleeping pill Belso", "meta_keywords": "Merck & Co, MSD, Belsomra, Registration, Revoked, Insomnia, Selling price", "meta_description": "Merck revokes registration for its next-generation sleeping pill Belsomra in Russia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-18 12:25:24", "updated": "2021-05-18 12:33:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-revokes-registration-for-its-next-generation-sleeping-pill-belsomra-in-russia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "msd_merck_sign_large.jpg", "image2id": "msd_merck_sign_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Psychoactive drugs", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia, USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co, MSD", "drug_tag": "Belsomra", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-18 12:26:00"}
