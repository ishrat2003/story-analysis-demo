Sonelokimab showed impressive efficacy with a favorable safety profile, and numerically outperformed active control secukinumab, Novartis&rsquo; (NOVN: VX) Cosentyx.</p>\n<p>In the study, dosages up to 120mg showed rapid and significant clinical benefit compared with placebo. In the highest dosage group, almost six out of 10 patients (57%) achieved total skin clearance (PASI 100 response) after 24 weeks. Rapid response was demonstrated with one of three patients already achieving almost clear skin (PASI 90 response) by week 4.</p>\n<p>Analysis of an individualized dosing scheme including off-drug periods in controlled patients revealed durable responses over one year. Sonelokimab was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the active control, secukinumab, and an overall candida rate of 7.4%. Although the highest dosage and schedule could be used for future clinical studies, additional assessment and modelling may aid in the final selection of the optimal dosage and schedule.</p>\n<p>The trial was conducted by Avillion LLP under a 2017 co-development agreement with Merck.</p>\n<h2><strong>Game-changing potential</strong></h2>\n<p>Investigator Dr Kristian Reich, chief scientific officer and co-founder of MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, commented: &ldquo;Sonelokimab is a remarkable Nanobody with game-changing potential in the treatment of a range of IL-17A/F-driven inflammatory diseases. This study shows very high response levels in the model disease psoriasis, with a favorable benefit-safety profile. MoonLake&rsquo;s aim is to also accelerate Sonelokimab&rsquo;s development in other inflammatory diseases driven by IL-17A and IL-17F like psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Our aim is to elevate treatment goals in these diseases based on the unique characteristics of Sonelokimab, giving patients with common and burdensome skin and joint conditions a chance of better disease control.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-06 16:19:00", "meta_title": "Impressive Phase IIb data for MoonLake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sonelokimab", "meta_keywords": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, Sonelokimab, Phase IIb", "meta_description": "Impressive Phase IIb data for MoonLake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sonelokimab", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-06 16:17:48", "updated": "2021-05-07 11:04:26", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/impressive-phase-iib-data-for-moonlake-s-sonelokimab", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "moonlake_large.png", "image2id": "moonlake_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Dermatologicals", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland", "company_tag": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics", "drug_tag": "sonelokimab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-06 16:19:00"}
