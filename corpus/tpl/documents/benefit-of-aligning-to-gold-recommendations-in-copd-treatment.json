A second analysis demonstrated no differences in all-cause mortality between LAMA/LABA and triple therapy. The third analysis showed great geographic disparity in how GOLD recommendations are followed.</p>\n<p>According to the GOLD recommendations, inhaled bronchodilators, such as LAMAs and LAMA/LABAs, remain the preferred maintenance treatment.
