However, according to them, in its original form, the register was created as a formal list of drug names without linking them to patents.</p>\n<p>The Association in its letter asks PM Mishustin to make a number of changes to the existing regulations, particularly those which regulate the design of a register and public procurement mechanisms by Rospatent.</p>\n<p>In addition, the association asks the Prime Minister to initiate the process of recognizing the formal status of the register by other countries of the Eurasian Economic Space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the initiative of pharmaceutical companies has already been opposed by patient organizations in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sergei Golovin, head of the Medicines Accessibility Department at the Treatment Preparedness Coalition, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading patent public associations, said in an interview with local <em>Kommersant</em> business paper, this is an excessive measure that can negatively affect the current range of drugs available in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to him, strict patent linkage, which is demanded by producers, can lead to a sharp reduction in the production of generics, as the Russian Ministry of Health may stop accepting applications for registration of such drugs before the expiration of patents for original ones.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Restrictive measures rarely imposed</strong></h2>\n<p>At present, restrictive measures are rarely imposed on the release and sale of contested generic drugs in Russia. For example, in 2020, 4.860 packages of Bayer&rsquo;s cancer drug Nexavar (sorafenib) were sold on the local market for a total sum of 569 million roubles ($7.5 million). This, however, was significantly lower than the 11.700 packs of \"Sorafenib-nativ\" (worth 1.3 billion roubles) - a generic drug based on Nexavar produced by the Russian pharmaceutical company Nativa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because of this, Bayer has refused to localize the production of the drug in Russia. As for Nativa, the company currently remains a leader in Russia in terms of number of judicial proceedings with foreign drugmakers due to the release of generics before the expiration of patents for original drugs.</p>", "date": "2021-03-30 12:03:00", "meta_title": "Global drugmakers again demand better protection of patent rights in R", "meta_keywords": "Patents, Protection, Rospatent, Register, Infarma, Bayer, Nexavar, Nativa", "meta_description": "Global drugmakers again demand better protection of patent rights in Russia", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-30 12:02:06", "updated": "2021-03-30 12:09:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/global-drugmakers-again-demand-better-protection-of-patent-rights-in-russia", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "russia_li.jpg", "image2id": "russia_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": NaN, "topic_tag": "Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Patents & Trademarks, Russian market", "geography_tag": "Russia", "company_tag": "Bayer, Nativa", "drug_tag": "Nexavar, Sorafenib", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-30 12:03:00"}
