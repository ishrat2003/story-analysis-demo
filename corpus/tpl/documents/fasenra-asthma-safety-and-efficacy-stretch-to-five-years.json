The most commonly-reported AEs during the open-label period for patients receiving Fasenra every eight weeks were nasopharyngitis, asthma, headache, and bronchitis. These data confirm Fasenra&rsquo;s well-established safety profile.</p>\n<p>In secondary endpoints, Fasenra sustained the reduction in asthma exacerbation rates observed during predecessor Phase III trials, with annualized asthma exacerbation rates remaining consistently low over the five-year treatment period.</p>\n<p>Arnaud Bourdin, head of pulmonology, Professor of respiratory medicine at Arnaud de Villeneuve Hospital, Montpellier, France, and primary investigator for MELTEMI, said: &ldquo;Clinicians treating severe eosinophilic asthma want to ensure the therapy they prescribe will continue to help patients control their illness in the long term, with a consistent safety profile.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Based on the new MELTEMI data, physicians and their patients should feel confident that Fasenra provides a treatment option that can do exactly that &ndash; reduce exacerbations, with a known safety profile.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mark White, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s global franchise head, Fasenra, said: &ldquo;The new data from MELTEMI are exciting as they confirm Fasenra&rsquo;s efficacy and safety profile seen in previously reported Phase III trials. These results should offer further confidence to physicians and patients that the positive outcomes they&rsquo;re experiencing whilst using Fasenra can be maintained for the longer-term.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the USA, European Union (EU), Japan and other countries, and is approved for self-administration in the USA and EU.</p>\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has also granted Orphan Drug designation for Fasenra for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in November 2018, hypereosinophilic syndrome in February 2019 and eosinophilic esophagitis in August 2019.</p>", "date": "2021-05-19 18:04:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Fasenra, asthma, safety, trials, Phase, patients, profile, years, MELTEMI, severe, drug, rates, consistent, data, treatment, stretch, efficacy, previous", "meta_description": "The AstraZeneca drug Fasenra (benralizumab) has been shown to be well-tolerated for up to five years, with a long-term safety profile consistent with previous P", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-19 17:56:38", "updated": "2021-05-19 20:13:02", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fasenra-asthma-safety-and-efficacy-stretch-to-five-years", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astrazeneca_big-1.jpg", "image2id": "astrazeneca_small-2.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Real-world evidence, Research", "geography_tag": "Sweden, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "Fasenra", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-19 18:04:00"}
