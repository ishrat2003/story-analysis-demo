This could be the beginning of a new era of much wider access to trial results data for the benefit of public health,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>The development of the joint statement followed a series of discussions among ICMRA members and the WHO on new ways to enhance transparency and data integrity.</p>", "date": "2021-05-07 11:42:00", "meta_title": "International regulators and WHO call for wider public access to clini", "meta_keywords": "Clinical trial, Data, Access, Public, EMA, ICMRA, WHO", "meta_description": "International regulators and WHO call for wider public access to clinical data", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-07 11:42:00", "updated": "2021-05-07 11:50:18", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/international-regulators-and-who-call-for-wider-public-access-to-clinical-data", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "research_big.jpg", "image2id": "research_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities", "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "All therapy areas", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, European Medicines Agency, Public health, Regulation, Research", "geography_tag": "Global", "company_tag": "European Medicines Agency, World Health Organisation", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-07 11:42:00"}
