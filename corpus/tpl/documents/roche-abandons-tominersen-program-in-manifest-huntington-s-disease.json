The iDMC made its recommendation based on the investigational therapy&rsquo;s potential benefit/risk profile for study participants.</p>\n<h2><strong>Drug licensed from Ionis</strong></h2>\n<p>Tominersen (RG6042) was originally developed by USA-based Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: IONS) and licensed to Roche for $45 million in 2017. It was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Association in 2018. Roche&rsquo;s shares were hardly changed by the news, but Ionis was down more than 18% at $45.25 by mid-morning trading.</p>\n<p>No new or emerging safety signals were identified for tominersen in the review of the data from this study. Roche intends to continue following participants for safety and clinical outcomes, without the dosing of the investigational medicine or placebo. Once full data from the Phase III study are available and analyzed, Roche will share learnings and future plans with the HD community.<br /> <br /> Dosing will be paused in the open-label extension study (GEN-EXTEND) of tominersen while data are carefully analysed to inform next steps on this study.</p>\n<h2><strong>&lsquo;Unfortunate news to deliver&rsquo;</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;This is very unfortunate news to deliver on the tominersen Phase III study and we know it will be especially difficult for people with Huntington&rsquo;s disease to hear. The HD community currently has no treatments to stop or slow the progression of this rare neurodegenerative disease that impacts families across generations.&rdquo; Said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer and head of global product development.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;GENERATION HD1 is the largest clinical trial in Huntington&rsquo;s disease to date and we do know that the data generated will significantly advance our understanding of huntingtin-lowering as a potential treatment approach,&rdquo; he added.<br /> <br /> The Phase I PK/PD study (GEN-PEAK) of tominersen and the observational Roche HD Natural History Study will continue.</p>\n<p>Roche is also still pursuing Huntington&rsquo;s disease, via its Spark gene therapy unit that it acquired in late 2019.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-23 15:00:00", "meta_title": "Roche abandons tominersen program in manifest Huntington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease", "meta_keywords": "Roche, Tominersen, Huntington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, Phase III, Discontinued, Ionis Pharmaceuticals", "meta_description": "Roche abandons tominersen program in manifest Huntington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-23 14:59:01", "updated": "2021-03-23 15:07:32", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roche-abandons-tominersen-program-in-manifest-huntington-s-disease", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "roche_sign_large.jpg", "image2id": "roche_sign_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Roche", "drug_tag": "RG6042, tominersen", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-23 15:00:00"}
