The most common side effects seen in the study were rash, creatine kinase elevation, nausea, hyperbilirubinemia and diarrhea, most being NCI CTC Grade I/II and all were reversible. Several patients have been on therapy for more than one year, indicating the potential for a long duration of benefit.</p>\n<p>Melissa Aucoin, chief executive of the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition, said: &ldquo;Patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer urgently need better solutions due to low response rates and tolerability issues associated with current therapies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A Breakthrough Therapy designation in this disease is a significant step forward for the women who often, at a relatively young age, start a lengthy battle with this highly recurrent and impactful disease.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>RAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene, occurring in 30% of human cancers. These cancers are typically highly aggressive and recurrent, sending signaling commands through the RAS pathway.</p>\n<p>VS-6766 is a dual inhibitor of the RAF/MEK signaling pathway. With this unique dual mechanism of action, VS-6766 confers vertical inhibition of the RAS pathway in a single drug.</p>\n<p>Verastem is evaluating VS-6766 in combination with agents targeting other nodes in the RAS pathway as well as with agents targeting parallel pathways to address multiple cancer indications and mutations.</p>\n<p>Brian Stuglik, chief executive of the US biopharma, said: &ldquo;Breakthrough Therapy designation will facilitate our efforts to verify the robust and durable response and compelling safety profile of VS-6766 with defactinib that we have seen in patients with LGSOC and potentially bring a new therapy to these patients as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The majority of LGSOC is RAS pathway-driven, and we are committed to exploring the potential for VS-6766 as a backbone therapy across RAS pathway-driven solid tumors.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-05-25 13:21:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "therapy, breakthrough, cancer, inhibitor, ovarian, status, KRAS, designation, serous, low-grade, LGSOC, patients, recurrent, combination, Verastem, RAF/MEK", "meta_description": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Verastem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigational RAF/MEK inhibitor VS-6766.combined with de", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-25 13:16:08", "updated": "2021-05-25 14:02:17", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/verastem-combination-wins-breakthrough-status", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "verastem_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "verastem_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology, Women's health", "topic_tag": "Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Verastem", "drug_tag": "defactinib, VS-6766", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-25 13:21:00"}
