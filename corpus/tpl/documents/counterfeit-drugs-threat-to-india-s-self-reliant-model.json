Since there is a lot of consumption of sleeping medicines, antidepressants and painkillers in the region, the drug mafia has allegedly been creating a proxy demand for these drugs in the guise of providing these medications.<br /> <br /> A report related to the trade of illicit drugs in Agra notes the actual sale of pain and sleeping medicines is worth $33,286 per day. Recently, substandard opioid pain medication tramadol and codeine syrup worth about $66,572 was seized. Police personnel state the demand is very high for other drugs and painkillers like Spasco Proxyvan, nitrazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam and phensedyl.<br /> <br /> Last February, a crackdown by the Karnataka government had unearthed several substandard batches of generic medicines being sold at Jan Aushadi Kendras. These include common medicines like telmisartan and ramipril used to treat high blood pressure, nimesulide, a pain medication with fever-reducing properties, and even calamine lotion, used to treat mild itchiness.<br /> <br /> Though domestically-produced generics have often come under the scanner for failing quality tests, pain-relieving medicine tramadol and sleeping tablet alprazolam are being used by drug peddlers and illicit substandard consignments have found their way across the state.<br /> <br /> India has been battling the challenge of substandard drugs for a while. The Ministry of commerce and industry, Drug Controller and law enforcement agencies have come together to fight the menace of counterfeit drugs.</p>\n<p>Image:&nbsp;india_large_credit_deposit_photos</p>", "date": "2021-04-14 16:26:00", "meta_title": "Counterfeit drugs: threat to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reliant model", "meta_keywords": "Counterfeit drugs, Painkillers, Sleep medicines, Blood pressure, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam, ramipril, telmisartan, tramalol", "meta_description": "Counterfeit drugs: threat to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-reliant model", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-14 16:25:51", "updated": "2021-04-14 16:37:39", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/counterfeit-drugs-threat-to-india-s-self-reliant-model", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "india_modi_big.jpg", "image2id": "india_modi_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Generics", "therapy area_tag": "Analgesia, Cardio-vascular", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Legal, Public health", "geography_tag": "India", "company_tag": NaN, "drug_tag": "Clonazepam, codeine, Ramipril Tablets, Telmisartan, Tramadol", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-14 16:26:00"}
