a lack of data showing any link to severe adverse events, public health authorities in Europe previously suspended their use of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, with the goal of investigating reports of blood clotting among those who had previously been vaccinated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European authorities have also previously declined to support the use of the vaccine among older people, citing a lack of data confirming efficacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early release of an interim analysis from the USA-based trial, </span><a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strong-data-clear-path-for-new-covid-19-vaccine-in-usa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday, was therefore important for AstraZeneca, given that the data help address both of these concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the expeditious release seems to have confused the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which took the extraordinary step of notifying US authorities that the firm &ldquo;may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latest analysis provides a slightly updated picture which is consistent with the earlier results, and should help the firm to draw a line under a dispute which has threatened to undermine public confidence in the jab.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive vice president for biopharma, Mene Pangalos, said: &ldquo;The primary analysis is consistent with our previously released interim analysis, and confirms that our COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in adults, including those aged 65 years and over.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;We look forward to filing our regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization in the US and preparing for the rollout of
