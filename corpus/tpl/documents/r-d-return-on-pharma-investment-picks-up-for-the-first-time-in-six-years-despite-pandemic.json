The analysis revealed that between March and November 2020, the pandemic affected an estimated 1,210 trials across the industry. </p>\n<p>The vast majority of these (66%) had delayed starts or completions; and 8% were terminated (permanently stopped) or withdrawn (stopped before enrolling any patients).</p>\n<p>Colin Terry, consulting partner for European Life Sciences R&amp;D at Deloitte, commented: &ldquo;We are finally seeing seeds of change in the projected R&amp;D productivity given recent progress of some novel trial designs and improvements in efficiency through the digitalization of drug discovery and development.\"</p>\n<p>\"However, adoption continues to be experimental and not at scale across the industry, although accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic across all stakeholders and regulators. The &lsquo;need for speed&rsquo; has become all-encompassing alongside the realisation that development cycle times need to be reduced and new ways of working embraced to finally see the industry break the trends of the last decade,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Neil Lesser, principal, US Life Sciences R&amp;D leader at Deloitte added: &ldquo;While the uptick in performance is encouraging, sustaining it will require companies to continue investing in approaches that led to this positive direction. These include expanding investments in digital technologies and data science approaches, as well as increasing the use of transformative development models.\"</p>\n<p>\"The industry&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic proved that biopharma innovation can be speeded up through creative approaches to drug development - only time will tell if this progress becomes a permanent legacy,&rdquo; he added.</p>", "date": "2021-05-27 15:11:00", "meta_title": "R&D return on pharma investment picks up for the first time in six yea", "meta_keywords": "R&D, Investment, Return, Productivity, Trials, Costs, COVID-19, Impact, Deloitte", "meta_description": "R&D return on pharma investment picks up for the first time in six years, despite pandemic", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-27 15:06:12", "updated": "2021-05-28 10:23:38", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/r-d-return-on-pharma-investment-picks-up-for-the-first-time-in-six-years-despite-pandemic", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "2019_biotech_research_lab_big.jpg", "image2id": "2019_biotech_research_lab_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "All therapy areas", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Financial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "Global", "company_tag": "Deloitte, Drug Discovery", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-27 15:11:00"}
