Among all FL patients, median duration of response was not reached at a median follow-up of 14.5 months. In the safety analysis set (n=146), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities occurred in 8% and 21% of patients, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gilead acquired Kite in 2017 in a $12 billion deal, attracted by its pipeline, notably Yescarta. But so far, the CAR-T cell therapy has generated disappointing sales, recording full-year 2020 revenue of just $563 million, up 23% on 2019. Yescarta has previously won approvals in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.</p>\n<h2><strong>&ldquo;An important addition to the treatment armamentarium&rdquo;</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Once a follicular lymphoma patient&rsquo;s disease relapses, the duration of response to care shortens with each round of therapy,&rdquo; said Dr Caron Jacobson, medical director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. &ldquo;Additionally, for follicular patients in the third line of therapy, the five-year survival rate is only 20%, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that offer a real chance for durable remission. Impressively, 9%1 of follicular lymphoma patients in the ZUMA-5 study responded to a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, including an estimated 74% of patients in a continued remission at 18 months, giving these patients much-needed hope and oncologists an important addition to the treatment armamentarium.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As we look to bring the hope of survival to more patients in need, today&rsquo;s FDA decision represents a real step forward in our commitment in hematologic malignancies,&rdquo; said Christi Shaw, chief executive of Kite, adding: &ldquo;Advancing CAR T therapies for patients across lymphomas remains a cornerstone of our cell therapy development program, and we are excited about the potential of Yescarta for patients with indolent follicular lymphoma.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-06 14:33:00", "meta_title": "US FDA approves new indication for Yescarta", "meta_keywords": "Gilead Sciences, KIte, Yescarta, FDA, Approval, Lymphoma, Follicular", "meta_description": "US FDA approves new indication for Yescarta", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-06 14:32:48", "updated": "2021-03-06 14:39:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-fda-approves-new-indication-for-yescarta", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "kite_large-jpg.png", "image2id": "kite_small-jpg.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Hematology, Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Gilead Sciences, Kite Pharma", "drug_tag": "Yescarta", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-06 14:33:00"}
