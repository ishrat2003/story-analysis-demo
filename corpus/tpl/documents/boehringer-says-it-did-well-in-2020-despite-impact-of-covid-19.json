All of its businesses contributed positively to net sales and operating income.</p>\n<p>Boehringer recorded net sales of 19.57 billion euros ($23.23 billion), a 3% increase compared to the previous year. Foreign currency headwinds had a considerable impact; adjusted for currency effects, net sales rose by 5.6% year on year.</p>\n<p>Operating income at group level rose 22.2% to 4.62 billion euros. One-time gains from divestitures supported the operating income. Income after taxes saw a 12.5% year-on-year increase to 3.06 billion euros (2019: 2.72 billion euros).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Boehringer says it stepped up its investments in R&amp;D significantly in 2020 in pursuit of innovative medicines and therapies for diseases for which no satisfactory treatments are available. In particular, efforts to research potential COVID-19 related therapies were accelerated. The company spent 3.7 billion euros on R&amp;D, 7% more than in the previous year. This represents the highest annual investment in R&amp;D in the 136-year history of the research-driven biopharmaceutical company.</p>\n<h2><strong>Outlook for 2021</strong></h2>\n<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a more challenging industry environment with increasing price pressure in several key markets is expected to have an impact on Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s results in 2021. Assuming that the approved vaccines and other medicines currently undergoing the approval process help curb the COVID-19 pandemic, the company expects strong general market growth for prescription pharmaceuticals. For 2021, Boehringer Ingelheim expects to achieve a slight year-on-year increase in net sales on a comparable basis.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the results we achieved in 2020, considering the challenging conditions we faced,&rdquo; said Michael Schmelmer, the member of the board of managing directors responsible for Finance and Group Functions. &ldquo;We met our ambitious targets, both in terms of our contribution to the wellbeing of humans, pets and livestock, and our business performance. This allows us to continue to invest even more in R&amp;D, as well as in the long-term opportunities we have identified, most notably in the fields of oncology as well as digital and data technologies,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Human Pharma &ndash; Strong growth across all regions&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>At 14.42 billion euros, net sales of human pharmaceuticals grew strongly by 5.8% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects) and accounted for 74% of total net sales. All regions contributed to the strong results in Human Pharma. The USA remains the largest market for Boehringer Ingelheim with the highest regional net sales in the Human Pharma business, the company noted. The unit generated net sales of 5.66 billion euros in the USA, up 3.4% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects). In the EUCAN region (Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), net sales rose by 6.0% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects) to 4.59 billion euros.
