The CDC and FDA are reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets. All six cases occurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered. Usually, the anticoagulant drug heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given, the statement explains.</p>\n<p>The European Medicines Agency's pharmacovigilance unit last week also started a review of thromboembolic events that might be linked to the J&amp;J vaccine.</p>\n<h2>'Abundance of caution'</h2>\n<p>The CDC will hold a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. The FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,&rdquo; the statement explains.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is important, in part, to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The statement stresses that, at present, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare, and the agencies are due to provide additional information later on Tuesday.</p>\n<h2>European rollout delayed</h2>\n<p>J&amp;J's Janssen arm itself issued a statement later on Tuesday, stating that it has been reviewing the blood clot cases with European health authorities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe,&rdquo; the statement adds.</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 13:16:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "blood, vaccine, cases, rare, COVID-, recommend, pausing, review, statement, clots, health, agencies, type, clot, linked, latest, prompting, Johnson, pendin", "meta_description": "Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jab is the latest COVID-19 vaccine to be linked to rare cases of blood clots, prompting US health agencies to recommend pausing its use pend", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-13 13:12:04", "updated": "2021-04-13 18:14:40", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cdc-and-fda-recommend-pausing-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-use", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "johnson_big.jpg", "image2id": "johnson_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Focus On, Public health, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Janssen, Johnson & Johnson", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 13:16:00"}
