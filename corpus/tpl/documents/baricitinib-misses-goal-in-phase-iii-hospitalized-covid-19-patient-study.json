Baricitinib-treated patients were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical) or death, a difference that was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR]: 0.85; 95% CI 0.67, 1.08; p=0.1800).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a second disappoint for Lilly in its coronavirus ambitions, as a couple of weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/usa-drops-lilly-s-biologic-monotherapy-for-covid-19\">US government said it will no longer distribute</a> the COVID-19 monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for use on its own.</p>\n<p>Baricitinib, which was discovered by Incyte and is marketed under the brand name Olumiant, has been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration in combination with remdesivir for COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Further study details</strong></h2>\n<p>In COV-BARRIER, treatment with baricitinib in addition to SoC (which included 79% receiving corticosteroids and 19% receiving remdesivir, with some receiving both) resulted in a significant reduction (nominal p-value=0.0018) in death from any cause by 38% (n/N: 62/764 [8.1%] baricitinib, 100/761 [13.1%] placebo; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.78) by Day 28.</p>\n<p>A numerical reduction in mortality was observed for all baseline severity subgroups of baricitinib-treated patients and was most pronounced for patients receiving non-invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (17.5% versus 29.4% for baricitinib plus SoC versus SoC; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.80; nominal p-value=0.0065). A reduction in mortality was also seen for the pre-specified subgroups of patients being treated with or without corticosteroids at baseline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"There remains a driving unmet need for treatments with the potential to further decrease mortality for COVID-19 patients,\" said co-primary investigator Dr Wesley Ely, professor of medicine and co-director of the Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship (CIBS) Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"While COV-BARRIER did not hit the primary endpoint based on stages of disease progression, the data show that baricitinib meaningfully reduced the risk of mortality above and beyond the recommended standard of care, without additional safety risks. These important findings advance our pursuit of treatment options to save lives in hospitalized COVID-19 patients,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\"Even though the study did not show a statistically-significant benefit on the primary endpoint, this trial showed the largest effect reported to date for reduction in mortality observed for this patient population with COVID-19,\" said Ilya Yuffa, senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines</p>", "date": "2021-04-09 10:58:00", "meta_title": "Baricitinib misses goal in Phase III hospitalized COVID-19 patient stu", "meta_keywords": "Eli Lilly, Incyte, Baricitinib, COVID-19, Hospitalized, Patients, Phase III", "meta_description": "Baricitinib misses goal in Phase III hospitalized COVID-19 patient study", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-09 10:57:43", "updated": "2021-04-09 11:06:33", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/baricitinib-misses-goal-in-phase-iii-hospitalized-covid-19-patient-study", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "lilly-incyte-big.png", "image2id": "lilly-incyte-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Eli Lilly, Incyte", "drug_tag": "baricitinib, Olumiant", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-09 10:58:00"}
