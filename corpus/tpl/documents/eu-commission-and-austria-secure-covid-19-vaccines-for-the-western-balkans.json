I am happy to announce that we have secured doses to help vaccinate health care workers and other vulnerable groups in the Western Balkans. The European Union stands by our partners in the region, who have been looking to us for support. I want to thank Austria for facilitating this transfer, showing its firm commitment and solidarity with the Western Balkans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Commission stressed it is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world.
