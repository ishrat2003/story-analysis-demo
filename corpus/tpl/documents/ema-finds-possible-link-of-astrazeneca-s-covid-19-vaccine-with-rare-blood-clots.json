The vaccine is effective at preventing COVID-19 and reducing hospitalisations and deaths.</p>\n<p>Shares of the UK pharma major, which is distributing the vaccine globally on a not-for-profit basis, dipped just under 1% as trading was coming to an end for the day.</p>\n<p>The Committee carried out an in-depth review of 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 24 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis reported in the EU drug safety database (EudraVigilance) as of March 22, 2021, 18 of which were fatal. The cases came mainly from spontaneous reporting systems of the EEA and the UK, where around 25 million people had received the vaccine.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 is associated with a risk of hospitalization and death. The reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.</p>\n<p>One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin (heparin induced thrombocytopenia, HIT). The PRAC has requested new studies and amendments to ongoing ones to provide more information and will take any further actions necessary.</p>\n<h2><strong>MHRA sees reason to stop offering the jab to under 30-year-olds</strong></h2>\n<p>Also this afternoon, a review by the UK&rsquo;s drugs regulator the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found that, by the end of March, 79 people in the UK suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom died.</p>\n<p>The regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clot, but the link was getting firmer. Dr June Raine, head of the MHRA, said the side-effects were \"extremely rare\" - and more work was going on to identify if the vaccine was definitely causing the clots.</p>\n<p>She said: \"The balance of benefits and known risks is still very favorable for the majority of people.\" But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced.\"</p>\n<p>The review prompted the government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI, to recommend that people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available. People who have had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still get their second dose. Only those who suffered one of these rare blood clots after the first dose should not get vaccinated, the MHRA said.</p>", "date": "2021-04-07 16:20:00", "meta_title": "EMA finds possible link of AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine with rare bl", "meta_keywords": "AstraZeneca, COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, Blood clots, EMA, MHRA", "meta_description": "EMA finds possible link of AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine with rare blood clots", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-07 16:17:05", "updated": "2021-04-07 16:25:06", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-finds-possible-link-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-with-rare-blood-clots", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_large.png", "image2id": "covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Vaccines", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, UK", "company_tag": "AstraZeneca", "drug_tag": "COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-07 16:20:00"}
