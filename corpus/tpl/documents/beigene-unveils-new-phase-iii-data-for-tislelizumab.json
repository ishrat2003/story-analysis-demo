A supplemental biologics application (sBLA) based on these results from the RATIONALE 303 trial was accepted in March 2021 and is currently under regulatory review in China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Based on the RATIONALE 303 trial results, compared to docetaxel standard of care, tislelizumab significantly prolonged the median OS by more than five months in all patients and was able to yield a consistent OS benefit across all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status,&rdquo; said Dr Caicun Zhou, director of the Department of Oncology at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital and Director of Cancer Institute of Tongji University. &ldquo;Tislelizumab was also tolerated among these patients, with a notably lower incidence rate of Grade &ge;3 adverse events compared to docetaxel. We&rsquo;re encouraged by the promising findings presented today and hope tislelizumab could become an important treatment option for second- or third-line NSCLC patients,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>In January 2021, BeiGene and Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) entered into a collaboration and license agreement granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, and Japan. BeiGene received $650 million upfront from Novartis and is also eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion in regulatory milestones, $250 million for sales milestones, and royalties on tislelizumab sales in Novartis' territory. Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China.</p>\n<h2><strong>Delivering meaningful survival benefit</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Tislelizumab continues to demonstrate its potential in delivering meaningful survival benefit to patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC in both the second- and third-line setting, as shown in today&rsquo;s reported results, as well as with treatment-na&iuml;ve populations as previously reported at last year&rsquo;s ASCO and ESMO meetings,&rdquo; commented Dr Yong (Ben) Ben, chief medical officer, immuno-oncology at BeiGene. &ldquo;In addition, tislelizumab was generally well-tolerated, consistent with known risks from previously reported results across different tumor types. These encouraging results from RATIONALE 303, which supported the recently accepted sBLA in second- or third-line NSCLC in China, further suggest that tislelizumab is a potentially differentiated checkpoint inhibitor,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>Just last week, BeiGene announced approval from the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for BeiGene to begin manufacturing commercial supply of its approved anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, at its state-of-the-art biologics facility in Guangzhou, China.</p>", "date": "2021-04-13 14:13:00", "meta_title": "BeiGene unveils new Phase III data for tislelizumab", "meta_keywords": "BeiGene, Phase III, Tislelizumab, Cancer, Lung, AACR meeting, Novartis", "meta_description": "BeiGene unveils new Phase III data for tislelizumab", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-13 14:12:34", "updated": "2021-04-13 14:19:39", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/beigene-unveils-new-phase-iii-data-for-tislelizumab", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "beigenebig.png", "image2id": "beigene-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Immuno-oncology", "topic_tag": "AACR, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research", "geography_tag": "China, Switzerland", "company_tag": "BeiGene, Novartis", "drug_tag": "tislelizumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-13 14:13:00"}
