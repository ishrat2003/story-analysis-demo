Tezepelumab delivered a reduction in asthma exacerbations of 56% across all patients, and of 70% in high eosinophil patients, 41% in moderate Eos patients, and 39% in low Eos patients.</p>\n<p>This compares to an average reduction of 40% for IL-5&rsquo;s and 46% for Dupixent in all patients and reduction of 31% for Fasenra (IL-5) and 25% for Dupixent in low Eos population (&lt;300 cells/uL). These cross-trial comparisons are difficult to make confidently, but we believe it is reasonable to assume that tezepelumab is materially better than its rivals in low Eos patients, and similar to them in moderate and high eosinophil patients. Friday&rsquo;s (2/26) data showed NAVIGATOR not only achieved statistical significance on its primary endpoint, annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) reduction, but in both patients with high baseline eosinophil (Eos &gt;300 cells/uL) and those with low Eos (&lt;300 cells/uL).</p>\n<p>Even lower subgroup of patients with Eos &lt;150 cells/uL, which was not powered to show statistical significance, saw numerically comparable reduction to the &lt;300 patient group. We believe the results certainly support tezepelumab&rsquo;s approval and we expect significant penetration among low Eos count patients who do not respond to current biologics. However, Mr Porges also believes tezepelumab will face tougher competition in high Eos count patients where KOLs will consider other factors when choosing a biologic since efficacy is comparable. He also expects that the lack of steroid reduction benefit (due to failure of Phase III SOURCE study) could diminish tezepelumab&rsquo;s appeal compared to other biologics in the high Eos patients.</p>\n<p>He assumes tezepelumab will launch in 2022, growing to $1.2 billion by 2025E and $1.8 billion by 2027E (US sales as reported by Amgen).&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Olumiant leads the alopecia JAK pack</strong></h2>\n<p>Eli Lilly and Incyte last Wednesday claimed the first pivotal win for a JAK inhibitor in alopecia &ndash; but it might not be the last. The groups&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/first-jak-inhibitor-to-show-hair-regrowth-in-phase-iii-alopecia-trial\">Olumiant succeeded in Brave-AA2</a>, but Pfizer is not too far behind with its JAK3/TEC inhibitor ritlecitinib, whose Phase II/III study is also set to report in 2021, noted Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>Lilly is not disclosing data from Brave-AA2, only saying that both doses tested, 2mg and 4mg once daily, met the primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of patients achieving a severity of alopecia tool (Salt) 20 score at 36 weeks. Ritlecitinib&rsquo;s Allegro-IIb/III trial also evaluates Salt 20, at week 24, so if it hits it will be interesting to see how the projects stack up. Safety will also be under scrutiny given JAK inhibitors&rsquo; track record. Lilly said that in Brave-AA2 Olumiant&rsquo;s safety profile was consistent with experience in rheumatoid arthritis, for which it is Food and Drug Administration approved, and atopic dermatitis, for which it has European Medicines Agency approval.</p>\n<p>Still, Olumiant&rsquo;s US label has a black box warning for serious infections, malignancies and thromboses, which might hurt its chances in a disease like alopecia. The sell-side forecasts Olumiant sales of $1.2 billion in 2026, according to <em>EvaluatePharma</em> consensus, but none of this is expected to come in alopecia.</p>\n<p>Ben Fidler, writing on BioPharma Dive, pointed out that there are no approved treatments for alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that affects as many as 147 million people worldwide. That could soon change, as Lilly's drug and several others like it &mdash; medicines known as JAK inhibitors &mdash; are moving through late-stage trials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alopecia areata has been viewed as a promising area of research for JAK inhibitors after a 2014 Nature paper showed they may help reverse hair loss. The disease, which occurs when the immune system attacks hair follicles, is the second-leading cause of baldness, which can lead to anxiety, depression and other health issues. There are no drugs specifically approved for the disease, though immunosuppressive drugs are used off-label. People can also opt for wigs and hairpieces or hair-regrowth methods like platelet-rich-plasma therapy or minoxidil.</p>\n<p>JAK blockers, by contrast, are meant to tamp down the immune response and help regrow hair. That's led to significant interest among pharma companies and biotechs. Lilly and Incyte, Pfizer and Concert Pharmaceuticals each have programs in late-stage testing, said Mr Fidler.</p>\n<h2><strong>G1 Therapeutics &ndash; brighter days ahead</strong></h2>\n<p>Commenting on the recent <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cosela-now-launched-in-usa-for-people-with-extensive-stage-sclc\">approval and subsequent launch</a> last week of G1 Therapeutics and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s Cosela, blogger The GARP Investor wrote on Seeking Alpha.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>G1 Therapeutics' first in class drug, myelosuppression drug, Cosela (trilaciclib) has blockbuster potential.</li>\n<li>Management has positioned the company to succeed in their commercialization efforts.</li>\n<li>Massive sell-off after FDA approval has created a buying opportunity in the stock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Investing in a start-up biotech company is an absolute roller coaster. Clinical trials can both bring highs and lows to excess in terms of stock price and subsequently investor interest / confidence. The industry is admittedly risky, but that should not deter anyone from looking for potential market beating investments.</p>\n<p>The blogger believes that the recent approval of oncology drug trilaciclib (commercial name Cosela) in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer from company G1 Therapeutics has made the company worth looking into, and the subsequent approval-led sell-off by short-term profit takers has brought the stock price to a level I feel makes a compelling investment long term. It looks to me that the market is pricing in massively sub-par performances from the drug, and anything more will produce a large increase in the stock price. The company is also not a one trick pony, as Cosela is undergoing multiple other clinical trials in different cancers with larger addressable markets. G1 also has another compound in clinical trials called Rintodestrant, an oral SERD that it expects phase 2 data on in the second quarter of 2021.</p>\n<p>Now that FDA approval is out of the way, the make-or-break moment for Cosela&rsquo;s success is undoubtedly initial drug launch. This is admittedly a big risk considering G1 has had no prior drug approvals, and Cosela is a first in class drug that is creating an entirely new market. While there are many variables at play, the most important things I look at to determine G1&rsquo;s probability of success are the quality of management, their sales plan to bring the drug to market, and overall prescriber optimism.</p>\n<h2><strong>Five Prime&rsquo;s lesson in never giving up</strong></h2>\n<p>It is said that even the most hopeless biotech companies never die, but <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-replenishes-its-pipeline-with-1-9-billion-acquisition\">Five Prime, which is being bought by Amgen</a> for $1.9 billion, would never have been content just to survive in the graveyard shift. The takeover rewards its drastic restructuring of 2019, and completes a rags to riches to rags to riches fairy tale, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>\n<p>There is another angle too: Amgen has a desperately thin pipeline, which through various setbacks is now hugely dependent on the Kras inhibitor sotorasib, an asset with big potential and much to prove. In pulling the acquisition trigger Amgen seems at last to have acknowledged this fact.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it is some years since the once-acquisitive Amgen did anything as decisive as this. The company&rsquo;s buyouts of Biovex, Micromet and Onyx, worth over $12 billion combined, took place in 2011-13, and since then the only things to get bankers excited have been the $2.7 billion purchase of 20% of BeiGene and the $13.4 billion buy of Celgene's psoriasis drug Otezla, both in 2019.</p>\n<p>But with the largely unproven sotorasib carrying 2026 revenue forecasts of $2 billion, according to <em>EvaluatePharma </em>sell-side consensus, Amgen needs to do a lot to avoid disappointment. In Five Prime it found the perfect opportunity.</p>\n<p>It is hardly believable that barely two years ago Five Prime was sitting on an 80% two-year share price loss after its Bristol Myers Squibb-partnered anti-CSF-1R MAb cabiralizumab disappointed, and the company resorted to cutting costs and sweeping out its C-suite.</p>\n<p>In hindsight its decision to focus on bemarituzumab, an FGFR2B inhibitor, was a masterstroke. This wholly-owned asset has virtually no mechanistic rivals; when it added a mid-stage survival benefit string to its bow last November the phones at Five Prime&rsquo;s business development department must have started to ring.</p>\n<p>Amgen has been fairly transparently &ldquo;clearing the decks&rdquo; for significant M&amp;A in recent months, and the deal makes strategic sense in the context of Amgen&rsquo;s oncology pipeline, commented SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>\n<p>The premium (+79% to Five Prime&rsquo;s last close) is reasonable given bemarituzmab&rsquo;s late stage in development. After Amgen&rsquo;s fourth-quarter print, Leerink wrote that the company appeared to be signaling a transaction coming down the pipe (by &ldquo;clearing the decks&rdquo; in their pipeline and restructuring their salesforces), and it noted that Amgen&rsquo;s key assets, sotorasib (KRAS) and tezepelumab (TSLP), alone were not enough to offset pricing headwinds and LOEs in the mid-2020s.</p>\n<p>The Five Prime purchase is a fairly small transaction for Amgen relative to Leerink&rsquo;s expectations for the year and Amgen&rsquo;s capabilities for M&amp;A, so Mr Porges believes there could be more to come to further build out the pipeline. He does not expect any regulatory objections to the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, nor does he believe a higher offer for the company is likely.</p>\n<p>This transaction makes sense for Amgen, in his view &ndash; it's relatively small, bolsters the company&rsquo;s solid tumor franchise, should have operational synergies with sotorasib, offers potential well beyond its initial indication and has some (limited) platform value as well. The dilution to Amgen&rsquo;s future earnings should be modest (particularly after the pipeline rationalization at the end of the year) and Amgen&rsquo;s future revenue profile and growth outlook is improved by the acquisition, Mr Porges concludes.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-07 13:46:00", "meta_title": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 5, 2021", "meta_keywords": "News review, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Tezepelumab, Eli Lilly, Incyte, Olumiant, G1 Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cosela, Five Prime, Bemarituzumab", "meta_description": "Look back at pharma news in the week to March 5, 2021", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-07 13:43:31", "updated": "2021-03-07 14:03:51", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-5-2021", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png", "image2id": "tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Autoimmune Disorders, Immunologicals, Oncology, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": NaN, "company_tag": "Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Five Prime Therapeutics, G1 Therapeutics, Incyte", "drug_tag": "bemarituzumab, Cosela, Olumiant, tezepelumab", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-07 13:46:00"}
