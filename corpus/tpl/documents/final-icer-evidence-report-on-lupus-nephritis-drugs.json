Despite remaining uncertainty about both treatments&rsquo; longer-term outcomes, their estimated prices appear to be aligned with their anticipated clinical benefits. More research is needed to confirm these benefits, but for patients and clinicians to have responsibly priced options specifically indicated for lupus nephritis is a major win for patients and the entire health system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He continued: &ldquo;One policy element that was discussed at the public meeting, however, is worth attention. Aurinia sought and achieved a late-stage patent on voclosporin&rsquo;s dosing protocol. This unusual patent will likely deny patients access to a more affordable generic version of the treatment until 2037 &ndash; a full 10 years beyond what was previously expected. If extended patents through dosing algorithms becomes a new trend, we could see future budget headroom shrink for other innovative products, while patients and the entire health system struggle even more with affordability.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Voting on long-term value for money</strong></h2>\n<p>After reviewing the clinical evidence and considering the treatments&rsquo; other potential benefits, disadvantages, and contextual considerations noted above, the New England CEPAC evaluated the long-term value for these treatments.</p>\n<p>A majority of panelists found that belimumab, at its current pricing, represents &ldquo;high&rdquo; long-term value for money. The estimated annual price for belimumab is $43,000 for patients who remain on treatment, lower than the ICER&rsquo;s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range of around $45,000-$61,000 per year.</p>\n<p>A majority of panelists found that voclosporin, at its current pricing, represents &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; long-term value for money. The estimated annual price for voclosporin is $92,000, towards the higher end of the ICER&rsquo;s recommended HBPB of about $72,000-$101,000 per year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key policy recommendations&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the voting session, a policy roundtable of experts - including clinical experts, patient advocates, and representatives from US payers and relevant pharmaceutical companies - convened to discuss the implications of the evidence for policy and practice. Key recommendations stemming from the roundtable discussion include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All stakeholders have a responsibility and an important role to play in ensuring that effective new treatment options for patients with lupus nephritis are introduced in a way that will help reduce health inequities.</li>\n<li>Both belimumab and voclosporin are judged to be priced in reasonable alignment with estimates of their benefits for patients, and this consideration should guide payers to design coverage criteria that do not narrow coverage from the FDA label, although coverage criteria may define terms left indeterminate in the FDA label to assure appropriate use.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Manufacturers should commit to expanding their research, both before and after regulatory approval, to include adequate representation of patients with lupus nephritis from Black and other non-white populations.</li>\n<li>Manufacturers should not seek to use common sense dosing algorithms as a tool to gain prolongation of their patents, thereby adding to future health care affordability concerns and reducing the headroom for future innovative therapies.</li>\n</ul>", "date": "2021-04-16 14:01:00", "meta_title": "Final ICER evidence report on Lupus nephritis drugs", "meta_keywords": "ICER, Evidence report, Lupus nephritis, GlaxoSmithKline, Benlysta, Aurinia, Lupkynis, Effectiveness, Value", "meta_description": "Final ICER evidence report on Lupus nephritis drugs", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-16 13:59:11", "updated": "2021-04-16 14:09:15", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/final-icer-evidence-report-on-lupus-nephritis-drugs", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "icer_big.jpg", "image2id": "icer_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Lupus nephritis", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Nephrology and Hepatology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "Canada, UK, USA", "company_tag": "Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, ICER", "drug_tag": "Benlysta, Lupkynis", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-16 14:01:00"}
