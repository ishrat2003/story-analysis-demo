Nicox believes that each of these patents could be extended by almost the maximum five years allowable. The duration of this patent extension is subject to calculation by the US Food and Drug Administration with the final decision of the USPTO regarding the term of the extension expected in two to three years. Nicox would then select one of the three patents for the extension.</p>\n<p>Vyzulta is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</p>\n<h2><strong>Patent extension will ensure long-term revenue source</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Vyzulta was launched in the United States in December&nbsp;2017 by our exclusive global licensee Bausch + Lomb.
