Our high-resolution x-ray cocrystal structures further confirmed the specific covalent interaction with this conserved region of the proteases of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe that, due to their novel mechanism of action, our protease inhibitors are likely to be effective against new variants of SARS-CoV-2. This may include the recent variants first identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India, which may be more contagious forms of the virus and may evade immunity produced by vaccines or previous infection,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Lead candidate CDI-45205</strong></h2>\n<p>In December 2020, Cocrystal announced the selection of CDI-45205 as its lead coronavirus development candidate among a group of protease inhibitors obtained under an exclusive license agreement with Kansas State University Research Foundation (KSURF) announced in 2020.</p>\n<p>CDI-45205 showed good bioavailability in mouse and rat pharmacokinetic studies via intraperitoneal injection, and also no cytotoxicity against a variety of human cell lines. The company recently demonstrated a strong synergistic effect with the Food and Drug Administration-approved COVID-19 medicine remdesivir. Additionally, a proof-of-concept animal study demonstrated that daily injection of CDI-45205 exhibited favorable <em>in vivo</em> efficacy in MERS-CoV-2 infected mice. Cocrystal has obtained promising preliminary pharmacokinetic results and is continuing to further evaluate CDI-45205.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The immediate next steps in the process of advancing this candidate toward clinical development require scale-up synthesis and the subsequent manufacture of several kilograms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to support Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and Phase I trials,&rdquo; said Dr Lee. &ldquo;Similar to our influenza CC-42344 program, we are exploring multiple routes of administration of preclinical lead molecules including oral, inhalation and injection. We will also be examining <em>in vitro</em> activities of our compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 variants.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Enters $40 million stock offering deal</strong></h2>\n<p>Cocrystal also yesterday announced that it has entered into an underwriting agreement with H C Wainwright &amp; Co, under which the underwriter has agreed to purchase on a firm commitment basis 26,000,000 shares of common stock of the company, at a price to the public of $1.54 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about May 7, 2021, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p>\n<p>The gross proceeds to Cocrystal, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, are expected to be around $40 million. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for the expansion of its COVID-19 and influenza treatment development programs and general corporate purposes and working capital.</p>", "date": "2021-05-05 10:57:00", "meta_title": "Cocrystal Pharma soars on update of its COVID-19 antiviral programs", "meta_keywords": "Cocrystal Pharma, COVID-19, Antiviral programs, CDI-45205, SARS-CoV-2, Stock offering", "meta_description": "Cocrystal Pharma soars on update of its COVID-19 antiviral programs", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-05 10:56:09", "updated": "2021-05-05 11:03:50", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cocrystal-pharma-soars-on-update-of-its-covid-19-antiviral-programs", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "cocrystal_big.jpg", "image2id": "cocrystal_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Antiviral drugs", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Anti-virals", "topic_tag": "Business Financing, Coronavirus, Focus On, Research", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Cocrystal Pharma", "drug_tag": "CDI-45205", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-05 10:57:00"}
