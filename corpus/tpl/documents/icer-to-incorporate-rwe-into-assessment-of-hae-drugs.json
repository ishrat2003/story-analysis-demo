By defining the baseline demographics and utilization characteristics of patients who start HAE prophylaxis, evaluating HAE attack rates before initiation of prophylaxis, and updating our health cost assumptions accordingly, ICER aims to further clarify the overall value of these HAE therapies in real-world settings.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We appreciate Aetion&rsquo;s continued partnership as we work together to set new standards for how decision-grade RWE can be appropriately applied alongside high-quality clinical trial data to better inform the consequential decisions that biopharma manufacturers, insurers, and other stakeholders make every single day around drug pricing and patient access.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Carolyn Magill, chief executive of Aetion, added: &ldquo;Pilots like this will help inform efforts of HTA organizations around the world in their quest to evaluate how and when to base their decisions on RWE, while advancing how we as a health care industry - and a society - determine value.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As part of this pilot, the ICER has engaged clinical experts and the manufacturers of these HAE therapies, and each manufacturer was provided several weeks to respond to ICER&rsquo;s data request and comment on the proposed approach.</p>\n<p>The ICER will be proceeding with a condensed timeline for incorporating RWE into this re-assessment, and expects to publish its RWE update on July 27, 2021.</p>", "date": "2021-04-12 15:53:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "ICER, assessment, observational, therapies, evidence, Aetion, real-world, update, prophylaxis, clinical, attacks, economic, ICERs, data, information, drugs", "meta_description": "The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has announced that it is using observational real-world evidence (RWE) to update its 2018 assessment of th", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-12 15:22:20", "updated": "2021-04-12 15:57:42", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-to-incorporate-rwe-into-assessment-of-hae-drugs", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "medicines_money_stock_large.jpg", "image2id": "medicines_money_stock_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Genetics, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "CSL Behring, Takeda", "drug_tag": "Cinryze, Haegarda, Takhzyro", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-12 15:53:00"}
