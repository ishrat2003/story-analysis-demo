To this end, we have invested considerable time and resource in accelerating the development of carbon minimal technologies to treat respiratory conditions, as well as empowering patients to dispose of their inhalers in an environmentally safe manner.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Initiating activity to scope alternatives to the current plastic use for all our inhalers is overdue and the start of an important journey for us and the wider pharmaceuticals sector.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rebecca Rae-Evans, director at Reply, said: &ldquo;Millions of people rely on inhalers but currently they are a throwaway item. Using our extensive human-centered design experience to redesign the actuator so that it can be more environmentally friendly is the primary aim of this project.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Winning this funding and support from Innovate UK is a huge opportunity for both us and Dsposal.
