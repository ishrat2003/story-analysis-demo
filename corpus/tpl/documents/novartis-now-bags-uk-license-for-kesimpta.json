The final Marketing Authorization (MA) from the MHRA, brings eligible patients living with RMS a step closer to access Kesimpta in England, Scotland and Wales. Initial decisions on Kesimpta from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicine Consortium (SMC) are expected to publish their final advice this year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Competitive sector</strong></h2>\n<p>Kesimpta is entering a crowded market, with a number of new drugs having debuted in the MS therapy area recently.</p>\n<p>With Swiss rival Roche&rsquo;s Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) boasting impressive levels of efficacy, Novartis will face stiff competition. Roche&rsquo;s offering - which also has a lower wholesale acquisition cost - is expected by analysts to be the market leader by 2026.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The MS Trust is delighted that ofatumumab, the first self-administered B-cell therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS with active disease, has been granted both MHRA and EMA licence. Relapsing forms of MS can have a serious and difficult impact on all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; said David Martin, chief executive of the Multiple Sclerosis Trust.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At Novartis we are proud to be offering innovative treatments that help improve the lives of people living with MS,&rdquo; said Chinmay Bhatt, managing director UK, Ireland &amp; Nordics for Novartis Pharmaceuticals, adding: &ldquo;Ofatumumab is an innovative treatment for those in the beginning stages of their MS journey. Ofatumumab demonstrates our commitment to reimagining medicine and we will work closely with all UK stakeholders to ensure eligible patients can start benefitting from this treatment as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Novartis in multiple sclerosis</strong></h2>\n<p>The current Novartis MS portfolio includes Gilenya (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is licensed in the UK and Europe for the treatment of adults and children aged 10 years and older with highly active relapsing remitting forms of MS.</p>\n<p>Mayzent (siponimod) is licensed in the UK and Europe for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity.</p>\n<p>Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is licensed in the UK and Europe to treat people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), people with SPMS with active disease (evidenced by relapses) and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS with an active inflammatory process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-04-08 15:07:00", "meta_title": "Novartis now bags UK license for Kesimpta", "meta_keywords": "Novartis,  Kesimpta, Genmab, MHRA, Authorization, Multiple sclerosis, Roche, Ocrevus", "meta_description": "Novartis now bags UK license for Kesimpta", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-08 15:05:19", "updated": "2021-04-08 15:17:21", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-now-bags-uk-license-for-kesimpta", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "kesimpta_big.jpg", "image2id": "kesimpta_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Treatment of multiple sclerosis", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, UK", "company_tag": "Genmab, Novartis, Roche", "drug_tag": "Kesimpta, Ocrevus", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-08 15:07:00"}
