Additionally, in parallel the company intends to seek scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency on the planned registration trial.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the FAB-GT trial continues to progress. A total of six patients have now been dosed, including two in the past two months, and additional participants are enrolled in the study.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-05-04 16:28:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "therapy, approval, Avrobio, gene, full, trial, AVR-RD-, Fabry, disease, investigational, shares, development, endpoint, company, registration, Fabrazyme", "meta_description": "Shares in US gene therapy company Avrobio closed 19% lower on Monday.", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-04 16:11:37", "updated": "2021-05-04 17:14:43", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/avrobio-shares-suffer-on-forced-change-to-gene-therapy-development", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "avrobio_large.png", "image2id": "avrobio_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Drug Trial, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation, Research, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Avrobio", "drug_tag": "AVR-RD-01", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-04 16:28:00"}
