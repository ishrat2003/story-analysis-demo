This medicine uses the same viral vector as Zynteglo, to deliver a gene into body cells.</p>\n<p>So far, no cases of leukemia have been reported with Zynteglo itself but bluebird has paused supply of the therapy while the evidence is examined.</p>\n<p>The PRAC&nbsp;will now examine the evidence, working with experts from the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Advanced Therapies, which is responsible for assessing this type of medicine, and decide on any relevant regulatory action for Zynteglo.</p>\n<h2>Ifosfamide investigation complete</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a separate investigation, the PRAC concluded that the benefits of ifosfamide solutions for infusion continue to outweigh their risks in the treatment of different types of cancers, including various solid tumors and blood cancers such as lymphomas.</p>\n<p>The review was started because two recent studies suggested that the risk of encephalopathy with ifosfamide supplied in solution forms is higher than with the powder form.</p>\n<p>The PRAC&nbsp;considered all available data and concluded that an increased risk of encephalopathy with ifosfamide supplied as a solution could neither be confirmed nor excluded due to limitations in the data.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;recommended that the existing warning on ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy in the product information should be updated with the latest information on this side effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image: Rob Acket</p>", "date": "2021-03-12 17:48:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": NaN, "meta_description": NaN, "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-12 17:44:56", "updated": "2021-03-12 18:16:15", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/prac-begins-safety-review-of-bluebird-bio-s-zynteglo", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "ema_conference-room-xl_credit_rob-acket_large.jpg", "image2id": "ema_conference-room-xl_credit_rob-acket_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": "Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee", "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, USA", "company_tag": "bluebird bio", "drug_tag": "Ifosfamide, LentiGlobin, Zynteglo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-12 17:48:00"}
