Results of the interim analysis, based on data from 583 randomized patients, demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalization or death in those receiving VIR-7831 compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. As a result, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy. The CHMP review will also consider data on the medicine&rsquo;s quality and safety.</p>\n<h2><strong>Granted Australian provisional determination</strong></h2>\n<p>This week, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of the Department of Health, granted VIR-7831 a provisional determination. VIR-7831 is the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody to have been granted this designation which provides a formal and transparent mechanism for accelerating the registration of promising new medicines with preliminary clinical data</p>\n<p>VIR-7831 is an investigational compound and has not been granted a marketing authorization anywhere in the world. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for VIR-7831 has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n<p>GSK is planning to submit a full Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA which will include the data from the COMET-ICE trial.</p>", "date": "2021-04-16 12:23:00", "meta_title": "EMA to review VIR-7831 for the early treatment of COVID-19", "meta_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology, VIR-7831, COVID-19, Hospitalized patients, EMA, Review, Determination, TGA", "meta_description": "EMA to review VIR-7831 for the early treatment of COVID-19", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-04-16 10:17:55", "updated": "2021-04-16 12:23:39", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-to-review-vir-7831-for-the-early-treatment-of-covid-19", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "vir-biotechnology-large.png", "image2id": "vir-biotechnology-small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary", "topic_tag": "Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Australia", "company_tag": "GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology", "drug_tag": "COVID-19, VIR-7831", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-04-16 12:23:00"}
