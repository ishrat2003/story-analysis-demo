Rocket gained the same status in 2018 for its RP-L102, the company&rsquo;s lentiviral vector (LVV)-based gene therapy for the treatment of Fanconi anemia (FA).</p>\n<p>Additionally, patient enrollment has been fully completed for the Phase I/II trial. The study is being conducted at the University of California Los Angeles, University College London (UCL)/Great Ormond Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital, and Hospital Infantil Universitario Ni&ntilde;o Jes&uacute;s.</p>\n<h2><strong>Important steps in advancing program</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Receiving RMAT designation and completing Phase I/II patient enrollment are important steps in advancing our RP-L201 LAD-I program as efficiently and responsibly as possible,&rdquo; said Kinnari Patel, president and chief operating Officer of Rocket.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We look forward to maximizing the opportunity for enhanced dialogue with the FDA as we work closely with the agency on potential registration, thanks to the RMAT designation. Importantly, completing Phase I/II patient enrollment against the backdrop of a global pandemic is a testament to our team, collaborators, and the patients participating in the trial. I am grateful to all of them for their unwavering commitment as we seek to address the life-threatening impact of LAD-I on the lives of many infants, young children, and their families. We look forward to sharing data from our LAD-I trial in the second quarter in addition to the remainder of the pipeline throughout 2021,&rdquo; Dr Patel noted.</p>\n<p>RMAT designation allows companies to work closely with the FDA on a program&rsquo;s development and includes all the benefits of the FDA's Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations.</p>\n<p>Rocket has a unique first- and best-in-class multi-platform pipeline of both ex-vivo lentiviral vectors (LVV) and in-vivo adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for rare childhood diseases in serious need of drug treatments. The company has quickly become a gene therapy company to watch, with a pipeline of five gene therapies, all of which have the potential to be approved by 2025. New clinical data from all five is expected this year.</p>", "date": "2021-03-10 11:40:00", "meta_title": "Rocket rises as it receives RMAT status for LAD-I gene therapy", "meta_keywords": "Rocket Pharmaceuticals, RP-L201, RMAT designation, FDA, LAD-I gene therapy", "meta_description": "Rocket rises as it receives RMAT status for LAD-I gene therapy", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-09 17:59:55", "updated": "2021-03-10 11:40:54", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rocket-rises-as-it-receives-rmat-status-for-lad-i-gene-therapy", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "rocket_pharma_large-1-.png", "image2id": "rocket_pharma_small-1-.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Regulation, US FDA", "geography_tag": "USA", "company_tag": "Rocket Pharmaceuticals", "drug_tag": "RP-L102, RP-L201", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-10 11:40:00"}
