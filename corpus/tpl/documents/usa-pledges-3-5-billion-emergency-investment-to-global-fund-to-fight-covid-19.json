This supplements the Global Fund&rsquo;s annual funding and will go through State Department global health funding.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the announcement, the Global Fund said it &ldquo;applauds the US government for approving emergency funding for the Global Fund&rsquo;s effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries.&rdquo; This unprecedented support will rapidly accelerate the Global Fund&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, which is critical to save lives and protect the gains its partnership has made against HIV, TB and malaria over the last two decades.</p>\n<p>In the last year, COVID-19 has caused widespread disruption to HIV, TB and malaria service delivery. The Global Fund&rsquo;s COVID-19 response is mitigating the impact of the crisis on the three diseases, protecting health workers and reinforcing health systems.</p>\n<h2><strong>Hopeful that other donors will follow</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;We are tremendously thankful to the Biden-Harris Administration and to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for their long-standing and exceptional leadership in global health,&rdquo; said Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund. &ldquo;This bold support will save many lives and reinvigorate economies around the world.
