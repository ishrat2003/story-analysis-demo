The agreement also includes co-exclusive rights for Novartis to develop imaging applications for these assets. Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Novartis has established global expertise and specialized supply chain and manufacturing capabilities across its network of four radioligand therapy production sites, and is further increasing capacity to ensure delivery of radioligand therapies such as <sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-617, which came to Novartis with its $2.1 billion acquisition of Endocyte in 2018.</p>\n<p>Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell-surface protein expressed at low levels in most normal adult tissues, but over-expressed in common cancers, particularly on cancer-associated fibroblasts that form the tumor stroma, which is essential for growth. High FAP expression on cancer-associated fibroblasts is generally associated with worse prognosis in solid tumors due to promotion of tumorigenesis and progression.</p>\n<h2><strong>FAP is an &lsquo;exciting target&rsquo;</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;We continue to invest in radioligand therapy as one of the four unique platforms of Novartis Oncology. We believe working across multiple approaches is the key to reimagining cancer care,&rdquo; said Susanne Schaffert, president, Novartis Oncology. &ldquo;FAP is an exciting target and these agents are a great fit with our radioligand therapy pipeline, which we are actively investigating across multiple tumor types. We believe this technology has the potential to transform many patients&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>Targeted radioligand therapy is a type of precision medicine combining two key elements: a targeting compound, or ligand, and a radioactive isotope, causing DNA damage that inhibits tumor growth and replication. These targeted drugs bind to markers or proteins over-expressed by certain tumors, or tumor-associated tissue, such as stroma. Due to the high-affinity of these agents for specific tumor cells or associated tumor tissue, surrounding healthy tissue is less affected.</p>", "date": "2021-03-30 11:11:00", "meta_title": "Novartis Oncology expands radioligand pipeline with exclusive worldwid", "meta_keywords": "Novartis Oncology, Agreement, Rights, iTheranostics, Radioligands, 177Lu-PSMA-617", "meta_description": "Novartis Oncology expands radioligand pipeline with exclusive worldwide rights", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-30 11:10:36", "updated": "2021-03-30 11:20:14", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-oncology-expands-radioligand-pipeline-with-exclusive-worldwide-rights", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "novartis_sign_large.jpg", "image2id": "novartis_sign_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Switzerland, USA", "company_tag": "iTheranostics, Novartis, Sofie Biosciences", "drug_tag": "177Lu-PSMA-617", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-30 11:11:00"}
