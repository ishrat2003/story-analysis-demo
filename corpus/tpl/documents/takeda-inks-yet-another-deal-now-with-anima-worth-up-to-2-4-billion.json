The parties will collaborate to advance the molecules to clinical candidates, which Takeda has the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize.</p>\n<p>The pre-clinical research collaboration will initially include Anima&rsquo;s early Huntington&rsquo;s disease program against the HTT target, selectively inhibiting the mutated protein with small molecules and two additional targets named by Takeda, related to neurological diseases.</p>\n<p>This partnership builds on <a href=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lilly-inks-1-billion-plus-deal-for-translation-inhibitors-of-several-protein-targets\">Anima&rsquo;s previous collaboration with Eli Lilly</a> in July 2018 that could exceed more than $1 billion for the discovery and development of translation inhibitors for several target proteins using Anima&rsquo;s Translation Control Therapeutics platform.</p>\n<p>For Takeda, it is a second bet in the Huntington&rsquo;s space, as it adds to the $230 million <a href=\"/content/article/edit/id/V\">deal with Wave Life Science</a> consummated in February 2018.</p>\n<h2><strong>Financial terms of the deal</strong></h2>\n<p>Takeda will pay Anima up to around $120 million in upfront and pre-clinical research milestone payments and up to $1.1 billion in clinical and commercial milestones, assuming success of the three programs. Anima is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of each product resulting from the collaboration. Takeda has a time limited option to expand the collaboration with up to three additional targets subject to additional payments to Anima of up to $1.2 billion and tiered royalties, assuming success of these programs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Anima Biotech&rsquo;s expertise in understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms of protein expression in the central nervous system makes them an ideal partner to explore this novel area of drug discovery,&rdquo; said Ceri Davies, head, Neuroscience Drug Discovery Unit at Takeda, adding: &ldquo;By combining Anima&rsquo;s platform with our strength in translational medicine and clinical development, we aim to develop medicines that deliver greater benefits to patients with genetically-defined neurological diseases where there are non-existent or ineffective treatment options.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Partnering is a core strategy of Anima and our model is to build collaborations that maximize the probability of success by combining our discovery platform and expertise in translation control biology with the scientific, clinical and commercial capabilities of our partners,&rdquo; said Yochi Slonim, Anima&rsquo;s co-founder chief executive. &ldquo;Takeda&lsquo;s leadership and depth of scientific expertise in the CNS area is ideally suited for our second Pharma partnership in Neuroscience and further validates our leadership in mRNA translation control,&rdquo; Mr Slonim noted.</p>", "date": "2021-03-18 17:30:00", "meta_title": "Takeda inks yet another deal, now with Anima worth up to $2.4 billion", "meta_keywords": "Anima Biotech, Takeda, Collaboration, mRNA, Neurological diseases, Huntington's", "meta_description": "Takeda inks yet another deal, now with Anima worth up to $2.4 billion", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-18 17:08:16", "updated": "2021-03-18 17:30:11", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/takeda-inks-yet-another-deal-now-with-anima-worth-up-to-2-4-billion", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "animabio.jpg", "image2id": "takeda_corporate_small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "CNS Diseases, Neurological", "topic_tag": "Deals, Licensing, Research", "geography_tag": "Japan, USA", "company_tag": "Anima Biotech, Takeda", "drug_tag": NaN, "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-18 17:30:00"}
