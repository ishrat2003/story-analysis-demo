The UAE has also expressed a strong desire to set up manufacturing facilities for vaccines by Indian companies.<br /> <br /> As key stakeholders from UAE and India gathered together virtually to deliberate on exploring new avenues for partnership between the two countries, the importance of countries cooperating in the pharma and medical sector and how affordable, world-class services could be made available to the common man were among the many topics of discussion.</p>\n<h2><strong>Need for deeper engagement highlighted by pandemic</strong></h2>\n<p>Indian Ambassador to the UAE Pavan Kapoor said the close cooperation between the two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic was encouraging.
