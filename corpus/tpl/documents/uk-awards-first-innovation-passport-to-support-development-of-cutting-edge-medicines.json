By incorporating patient views, both on the benefits and risks of medicines in the pathway, and on how to improve patient outcomes throughout the product lifecycle, medicines can be developed to meet patient requirements more successfully.</p>\n<h2><strong>Aims to encourage approval applications post-Brexit</strong></h2>\n<p>Since its final departure from the European end-2020, UK medicines approvals are no longer dependent on the European Medicines Agency, and the new scheme aims to assure drugmakers about making additional investments to gain UK approvals.</p>\n<p>The conventional approach requires all data from clinical trials to be complete before a drug can be cleared for use. Under the new access pathway, drug companies will be able to submit data on a rolling basis as it becomes available &mdash; the same approach that allowed Britain to approve the BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines in December, noted the Financial Times.</p>\n<p>The award of this designation celebrates another first: the successful partnership between the MHRA, NICE and the SMC in making effective joint decisions and awarding Innovation Passports to products that will benefit patients.</p>\n<p>The Innovation Passport is the first step in the ILAP and is open to developers of a wide range of medicines, including medicines for rare diseases, repurposed medicines and Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. Since launch, companies have submitted 10 applications.</p>\n<p>In July 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to belzutifan for the treatment of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated RCC with non-metastatic RCC tumors smaller than 3 cm in size unless immediate surgery is required.&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-01 10:36:00", "meta_title": "UK awards first \u00e2\u0080\u0098Innovation Passport\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to support development of cuttin", "meta_keywords": "MHRA, Innovation passport, Access pathway, ILAP, Merck & Co, Belzutifan, Hippel-Lindau disease", "meta_description": "UK awards first \u00e2\u0080\u0098Innovation Passport\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to support development of cutting-edge medicines", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-02-28 15:23:33", "updated": "2021-03-01 10:36:44", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uk-awards-first-innovation-passport-to-support-development-of-cutting-edge-medicines", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "mhra_large.png", "image2id": "mhra_small.png", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Genetics, Rare diseases", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "Merck & Co", "drug_tag": "belzutifan", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-01 10:36:00"}
