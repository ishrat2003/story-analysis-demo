This decision is deeply concerning and will not only come as a huge blow to the TDT community, but also sets a dangerous precedent which could limit access to other gene therapies in the UK in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TIF has submitted a commentary on the NICE&acute;s consultation document, referring to Zynteglo as a potentially life-saving and long-awaited treatment.</p>\n<h2>Potential to influence other health authorities across the world</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;The consultation makes no reference to allowing patients the possibility to choose to undergo gene therapy treatment, but leaves all with an unqualified denial of support,&rdquo; the TIF statement says. &ldquo;It is noted that in the absence until now of any other curative treatment, the only available option for many patients with TDT who wish to be cured is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a far more dangerous procedure that carries many and multiple risks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The federation also expresses its vivid concerns that any respective decisions made by NICE and the NHS on the Zynteglo gene therapy may further influence opinions and decisions of other health authorities across the world, particularly those that may lack national health technology assessment bodies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is our submission that in the current climate and growing sensitivity to health inequalities, the NICE&rsquo;s guidance should be carefully reviewed, and while we recognize that there are complex considerations at play, we sincerely hope that these do not impact the prospects of patients with thalassaemia in the UK of benefiting from cutting-edge treatments.&rdquo;</p>", "date": "2021-03-03 15:25:00", "meta_title": NaN, "meta_keywords": "Zynteglo, health, NICE, gene, patients, national, bluebird, recommendation, federation, thalassaemia, stance, funding, group, Patient, echoes, snub, issuin", "meta_description": "The Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) has objected to the UK\u00c2\u00b4s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issuing of a negative recommend", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 1, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-03 14:26:47", "updated": "2021-03-03 15:28:30", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/patient-group-echoes-bluebird-bio-stance-over-zynteglo-uk-funding-snub", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "money_drugs_scales_large-1-.jpg", "image2id": "money_drugs_scales_small-1-.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biotechnology", "therapy area_tag": "Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology", "topic_tag": "Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access", "geography_tag": "UK, USA", "company_tag": "bluebird bio", "drug_tag": "Zynteglo", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": "Thalassaemia International Federation", "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-03 15:25:00"}
