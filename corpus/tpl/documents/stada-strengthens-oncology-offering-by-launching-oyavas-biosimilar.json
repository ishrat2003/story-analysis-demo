Under the terms of an agreement with mAbxience, STADA holds the marketing authorization and sales and marketing rights to Oyavas in around 40 European countries, including all 27 European Union member states.</p>\n<h2><strong>Comprehensive biosimilars portfolio and pipeline</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Introducing Oyavas is testament to STADA&rsquo;s strategy of being a go-to-partner for enabling patient access to biosimilars in Europe,&rdquo; commented STADA chef executive Peter Goldschmidt, adding: &ldquo;Through partnerships, STADA has built a comprehensive biosimilars portfolio and pipeline, not only in oncology, but also in therapeutic areas such as autoimmune disorders, osteoporosis and ophthalmology, as the group continues to strengthen its presence in the specialty pharma sector.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>STADA has been engaged in bringing biosimilars to patients and healthcare professionals since founding the Bioceuticals Arzneimittel in 2000. The company thus makes a strong contribution to cost efficiency in healthcare systems. The company has 13 years of market experience with its Silapo (epoetin zeta) treatment for anemia, including in adults receiving chemotherapy, that has become one of STADA&rsquo;s best-selling products since its introduction in 2008 as one of Europe&rsquo;s first biosimilar launches. In the oncology sector, STADA also offers Cegfila (pegfilgrastim) for stimulating the production of white blood cells, while STADA&rsquo;s marketed biosimilars portfolio includes the osteoporosis treatment Movymia (teriparatide).&nbsp;</p>", "date": "2021-03-31 10:14:00", "meta_title": "STADA strengthens oncology offering by launching Oyavas biosimilar", "meta_keywords": "STADA Azrneimittel, Oyavas, Bevacizumab, Avastin, Roche, Launch, German, Netherlands", "meta_description": "STADA strengthens oncology offering by launching Oyavas biosimilar", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-03-31 09:23:24", "updated": "2021-03-31 10:14:05", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/stada-strengthens-oncology-offering-by-launching-oyavas-biosimilar", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "stada-location-big.jpg", "image2id": "stada-location-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Biosimilars", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Management, Product Launch", "geography_tag": "Germany, Netherlands", "company_tag": "Roche, STADA Arzneimittel", "drug_tag": "Avastin, bevacizumab, Oyavas", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-03-31 10:14:00"}
