The EC approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase III ARCHES trial which evaluated enzalutamide in men with mHSPC.</p>\n<h2><strong>Currently limited options</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients have limited options and, unfortunately, there is a poor prognosis for many men,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Armstrong, Professor of Medicine, Surgery, Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Director of Research in the Duke Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers and lead investigator of ARCHES, adding: &ldquo;The research supporting this approval provides clinical evidence showing how enzalutamide can help improve outcomes for men with mHSPC, which gives healthcare professionals in Europe the option to offer the treatment across the advanced prostate cancer disease continuum.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Data from the ARCHES trial showed enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 61% versus placebo plus ADT in men with mHSPC (n=1,150; hazard ratio [HR]=0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.50]; P&lt;0.0001).<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Enzalutamide has been an established standard of care for men with advanced prostate cancer and has been prescribed to more than 610,000 patients worldwide since it was first approved in 2012,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Krivoshik, senior vice president and global therapeutics, area head, Oncology Development, Astellas. &ldquo;This new indication for enzalutamide provides men with mHSPC a much-needed, additional therapy option earlier in their treatment journey. We look forward to working with health authorities across Europe to ensure men with mHSPC have access to enzalutamide as soon as possible,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Competition</strong></h2>\n<p>Xtandi, which is partnered with US pharma giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), is already the dominant player in the market by value, and generated sales of 458.4 billion yen ($4.22 billion) in the fiscal year ended March 2021, up 14.6%, for Astellas.</p>\n<p>Competing in the sector is Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE JNJ), with its Erleada (apalutamide) and Zytiga (abiraterone acetate. Also in the sector is Bayer (BAYN: DE) challenger Nubeqa (darolutamide), which was approved for the same indication in Europe in April last year.</p>", "date": "2021-05-10 11:25:00", "meta_title": "EC approval for Xtandi in mHS prostate cancer", "meta_keywords": "Astellas Pharma, Xtandi, Prostate, Cancer, MHSPC, European Commission, Approval, Pfizer", "meta_description": "EC approval for Xtandi in mHS prostate cancer", "meta_robots": NaN, "meta_display_in_sitemap": 1, "canonical_url": NaN, "status": 3, "access_status": 0, "ignore_flexible_sampling": 0, "display_start_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_end_date": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "display_in_search": 1, "created": "2021-05-10 11:19:06", "updated": "2021-05-10 11:27:34", "access": NaN, "url": "https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ec-approval-for-xtandi-in-mhs-prostate-cancer", "description": NaN, "twitter_term": NaN, "twitter_widgetid": NaN, "key_facts": NaN, "news_snippet": NaN, "image1id": "astellasuk-big.jpg", "image2id": "astellasuk-small.jpg", "restrict_print": 0, "restrict_print_for_logged_out": 0, "box1_header": NaN, "box1_title": NaN, "box1_image1id": 0, "box1_url": NaN, "box1_introduction": NaN, "box1_position": 0, "tags": NaN, "sector_tag": "Pharmaceutical", "therapy area_tag": "Oncology", "topic_tag": "Asia Pacific, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation", "geography_tag": "Europe, Japan", "company_tag": "Astellas, Pfizer", "drug_tag": "Xtandi", "market index_tag": NaN, "theme_tag": NaN, "industry sector_tag": NaN, "medical condition_tag": NaN, "industry term_tag": NaN, "organization_tag": NaN, "person_tag": NaN, "position_tag": NaN, "medical treatment_tag": NaN, "facility_tag": NaN, "technology_tag": NaN, "journalist_tag": NaN, "published medium_tag": NaN, "political event_tag": NaN, "anniversary_tag": NaN, "sports event_tag": NaN, "movie_tag": NaN, "fax number_tag": NaN, "currency pair_tag": NaN, "sports league_tag": NaN, "date_tag": NaN, "music group_tag": NaN, "phone number_tag": NaN, "t v show_tag": NaN, "t v station_tag": NaN, "entertainment award event_tag": NaN, "industry_tag": NaN, "pharmaceutical drug_tag": NaN, "topmost public parent company_tag": NaN, "content_type_name": "Article", "pubDate": "2021-05-10 11:25:00"}
