<p>Completion of the agreement is subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions, which are expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021. BridgeBio&rsquo;s shares edged up a modest 2.6% to $60.64 by late morning on the news.</p>
<p>Infigratinib is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to inhibit FGFR, and being investigated for treatment of individuals with FGFR-driven conditions, including cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), urothelial carcinoma (urinary tract and bladder cancer), and other FGFR-driven cancers.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, BridgeBio will retain all rights to infigratinib in skeletal dysplasia, including achondroplasia. Subject to US Food and Drug Administration approval, QED and Helsinn will co-commercialize infigratinib in oncology indications in the USA and will share profits and losses on a 50:50 basis. Helsinn will have exclusive commercialization rights and lead commercialization for infigratinib in non-skeletal dysplasia indications outside of the USA, excluding China, Hong Kong and Macau, which are covered by BridgeBio&rsquo;s strategic development and commercialization collaboration with LianBio.</p>
<h2><strong>Deal provides $100 million upfront</strong></h2>
<p>BridgeBio says it is eligible to receive around $2.45 billion, including over $100 million in upfront, regulatory and launch milestone payments, and the remainder subject to the achievement of specified commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties in the high teens as a percentage of adjusted net sales by Helsinn of the licensed products sold worldwide, outside of the USA and Greater China. The sharing of commercialization supports BridgeBio&rsquo;s mission to rapidly advance and deliver medicines to patients, while supporting its build out of its own commercial team.</p>
<p>The FDA has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for infigratinib for patients with previously-treated advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) harboring an FGFR2 gene fusion or rearrangement.

<p>In patients aged 12 to 15 years with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust antibody responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated.

<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""The initial results we have seen in the adolescent studies suggest that children are particularly well-protected by vaccination""</span>The vaccine, which is sold under the name Comirnaty, is already approved for adults in much of the world.</p>
<p>Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive, Pfizer, said: &ldquo;We share the urgency to expand the authorization of our vaccine to use in younger populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We plan to submit these data to US Food and Drug Administration as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ugur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech, said: &ldquo;Across the globe, we are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children. The initial results we have seen in the adolescent studies suggest that children are particularly well-protected by vaccination, which is very encouraging given the trends we have seen in recent weeks regarding the spread of the B117 UK variant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very important to enable them to get back to everyday school life and to meet friends and family while protecting them and their loved ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The European Cannabis Report: 6th Edition, released today by specialist consultants, Prohibition Partners, highlights how 60,000 people were able to access cannabis medications for the first time in Europe in 2020, bringing the total to 185,000 patients for the year.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Many opportunities are still open for businesses to embed themselves in niches of the value chain, before the market becomes more established""</span>Europe&rsquo;s medical cannabis market will be worth 406 million euros by the end of 2021, a year-on-year growth of 75% compared to 2020, according to the report&rsquo;s estimates.</p>
<p>Germany is the top medical cannabis consumer in Europe owing to progressive legislation and a large and affluent population. It will constitute more than half of the European market until 2024 and will be worth more than 840 million euros by the end of the forecast period. Imports of medical cannabis into the German market increased by 37% last year, bringing the total to 9.3 tonnes of product.</p>
<p><img title=""medical_cannabis.jpg"" src=""/media/project_tpl/image/medical_cannabis.jpg"" alt=""medical_cannabis.jpg"" width=""800"" height=""450"" /></p>
<p>By 2025, countries like France and the UK will have developed patient access to medical cannabis considerably, and large European nations like these will represent a significant share of the European market, the report forecasts. If regulations continue to progress as predicted, the UK medical cannabis market could show the most significant growth of any country in Europe by 2025.</p>
<p>As adult-use cannabis is not yet legalized anywhere in Europe, the market for legal cannabis products in Europe remains entirely medical. This balance is expected to shift over the next four years, as more countries open up to the prospect of legalizing adult-use cannabis.</p>
<p>Prohibition Partners&rsquo; report identifies several European nations that could introduce legal access to adult-use cannabis by 2025, including the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany. Sales of adult-use cannabis could be worth over 500 million euros by 2025.</p>
<p>This progression of medical and legalized adult-use cannabis will contribute to exponential growth over the next four years, hence the estimate that the European cannabis market will be worth 3.2 billion euros by 2025.</p>
<p>Stephen Murphy, co-founder and chief executive of Prohibition Partners, said: &ldquo;Europe is beginning to realize its potential as the world's leading cannabis market. Since the first edition of The European Cannabis Report published four years ago, enormous progress has been made for patient access and cannabis education. We are only at the very start of our journey of cannabis in Europe but there is irrefutable momentum towards becoming the world's largest cannabis market, it is only a matter of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conor O&rsquo;Brien, a contributor to the report and analyst at Prohibition Partners, added: &ldquo;The European medical cannabis market is beginning to blossom. While competition is heating up for producers and suppliers of medical cannabis in Europe, many opportunities are still open for businesses to embed themselves in niches of the value chain, before the market becomes more established.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-31 15:56:00",,"cannabis, market, European, billion, euros, medical, report, Europe, growth, reach, legal, forecast, adult-use, worth, access, Prohibition, Partners, open","The European cannabis market is forecast to grow with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67.4% to reach 3.2 billion euros ($3.75 billion) by 2025, a new re",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-31 14:55:25","2021-03-31 15:57:30",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/europe-s-legal-cannabis-market-predicted-to-reach-high-of-3-2-billion-euros-by-2025,,,,,,cannabis-big.jpg,cannabis-sm.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Analgesia, CNS Diseases, Neurological","Health Medical Pharma, Markets & Marketing",Europe,,cannabis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The drug&rsquo;s developer, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), anticipates a regulatory decision in late third-quarter 2021. AbbVie gained rights to atogepant along with its $63 billion acquisition of Allergan, which completed in May last year.</p>
<p>The NDA is supported by data from a robust clinical program evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally-administered atogepant in nearly 2,500 patients who experience 4-14 migraine days per month including but not /limited to the pivotal Phase III ADVANCE study, the pivotal Phase IIb/III study, and the Phase III long-term safety study.</p>
<h2><strong>Committed leader in migraine</strong></h2>
<p>""With the integration of Allergan, AbbVie is now a committed leader in migraine with an almost 25-year history in migraine research. We look forward to potentially adding a new treatment option to our portfolio that will help more people with migraine,"" said Dr Michael Gold, vice president, neuroscience development, AbbVie. ""We believe atogepant is an advancement with the potential to offer meaningful benefits as a safe, effective oral preventive treatment option. Despite the availability of other migraine treatment options, the medical community and people living with migraine recognize the unmet need of those who face the unpredictable and debilitating realities of this disease.""</p>
<p>In the migraine space, AbbVie markets Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), the first FDA-approved, preventive treatment for adults with chronic migraine that, despite generic competition, continues to hold out against rival options to a significant extent, bringing in billions of dollars in annual revenues. It also has in its portfolio Ubrelvy (ubrogepant), the first FDA-approved oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant), which is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.</p>
<p>In the Phase III ADVANCE study, all active treatment arms of atogepant met their primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days over a 12-week treatment period. Also, the 30mg and 60mg doses met all six secondary endpoints with statistical significance. This study followed positive results from the Phase IIb/III study that met the same primary endpoint across all doses and dosing regimens. The Phase III long-term safety study evaluated safety and tolerability of 60mg oral atogepant administered daily over 52 weeks. The Phase III long-term safety study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting. Results from the Phase IIb/III study and the Phase III ADVANCE study were previously announced.</p>","2021-03-31 15:03:00","FDA accepts AbbVie's filing for atogepant for migraine prevention","AbbVie, Atogepant, Migraine, Prevention, NDA, Accepted, FDA, Botox, Ubrelvy","FDA accepts AbbVie's filing for atogepant for migraine prevention",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-31 15:03:22","2021-03-31 15:10:42",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-abbvie-s-filing-for-atogepant-for-migraine-prevention,,,,,,abbvie_us_large.jpg,abbvie_us_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Migraine,Biotechnology,"Analgesia, Neurological","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,AbbVie,"atogepant, Botox, Ubrelvy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>This decision marks the first approval for Cabometyx in combination with another therapy in Europe and the third indication of Cabometyx in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The news saw Ipsen&rsquo;s shares rise 4.6% to 73.20 euros by early afternoon, having hit a hit of 75.05 euros in early trading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s EC approval for the use of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo provides an important new first-line treatment option for patients living with advanced renal cell carcinoma,&rdquo; said Howard Mayer, executive vice president and head of R&amp;D at Ipsen, adding: &ldquo;At Ipsen, we&rsquo;re proud that this, now approved, treatment option not only addresses key efficacy benefits, but also the need to maintain quality of life for patients. We look forward to collaborating with a broad range of European stakeholders to bring this unique combination to eligible patients living with advanced renal cell carcinoma.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The EC approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial, presented during a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 and <a href=""http://email.msgsnd.com/c/eJwdjsFqwzAQRL_GPgrtaiVZBx3StD4U2n9YS6s4IY6DLPDvVxSGYQYG3uTovS483iNqBG0MaEdIqEBdaf7U5ur8xTiaP-aB9HbcjldWad_GNQqbxaMIT35ygHnKZRIXSraLQbFufMa1tfcxmMuAc9d5nuolj03t9dZr3u_dQSvQ1vX0-_X9s3O_4cKEY40L1y7u2LbKe-W68VNak_rPb7EkCguiOI8JDFDx2lkPgUPCIMB9AqUwJy6E1hH5xUoAzZyzJTSU_B94nkjG"">published</a> in the&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on March 3, 2021. In the trial, Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo demonstrated significant improvements across all efficacy endpoints. In patients receiving the combination, median progression-free survival (PFS), the trial&rsquo;s primary endpoint, was doubled compared to those receiving sunitinib alone: 16.6 months versus 8.3 months respectively (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41&ndash;0.64; p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>Overall survival (OS) also demonstrated statistically-significant improvements, reducing the risk of death by 40% versus sunitinib (HR: 0.60 [98.89% CI: 0.40-0.89]; p=0.001; median OS not reached in either arm). In addition, Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo demonstrated a superior objective response rate (ORR), with twice as many patients responding compared to sunitinib (55.7% vs 27.1%; p&lt;0.0001) and 8.0% vs 4.6% achieved a complete response respectively.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Key efficacy results were consistent across the pre-specified International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk and PD-L1 subgroups. The combination was well tolerated and reflected the known safety profiles of the immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor components in first-line aRCC.</p>
<p>Cabometyx, to which Ipsen acquired right in 2016 from USA-based Exelixis (Nasdaq: EXEL), is also approved in the European Union as a monotherapy for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior VEGF-targeted therapy, for previously untreated intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC, and for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults who have been previously treated with sorafenib. The EC approval in combination with Opdivo follows the US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s approval of the combination regimen for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC in January 2021.</p>","2021-03-31 14:15:00","EC approves Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo","Cabometyx, Opdivo, Combination, Ipsen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Approval, Carcinoma, Renal, European Commission","EC approves Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-31 14:14:05","2021-03-31 14:22:48",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ec-approves-cabometyx-in-combination-with-opdivo,,,,,,ipsen-logo-big.jpg,ipsen-logo-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Immuno-oncology, Oncology","European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation","Europe, France, USA","Bristol-Myers Squibb, Ipsen","Cabometyx, Opdivo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The group has announced plans to further integrate its wholly-owned subsidiary, Audentes Therapeutics, and establish Astellas Gene Therapies within the organization.</p>
<p>This will involve further advancing Astellas&rsquo; activities in R&amp;D, manufacturing and commercialization of the associated programs with a foundation in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy.</p>
<p>Astellas claims that the new center of excellence will enable it to achieve more effective and efficient operations, with a high-quality, safety and compliance standard.</p>
<p>The center of excellence will operate through three divisions specializing in research including technical operations, medical and development, and future commercialization of gene therapy programs.</p>
<p>There will be a focus on the programs for neuromuscular diseases brought by Audentes including its lead candidate AT132 for X-linked myotubular myopathy and AT845 for Pompe disease, in addition to advancing additional Astellas&rsquo; gene therapy programs toward clinical investigation.</p>
<p>Kenji Yasukawa, president and chief executive, Astellas, said: &ldquo;The field of gene therapy has made significant strides to date, and we believe the future holds even greater opportunity to bring new treatments to a wide range of diseases for patients in need.</p>

488213,,"NDA Group’s figures on USA and EU reflect record year for new drug approvals - despite pandemic","The NDA Group, a regulatory, drug development and medical device consultancy, has released findings from the eighth annual comparison of drug approvals in the European Union (EU) and the USA.","<p>The NDA Group, a regulatory, drug development and medical device consultancy, has released findings from the eighth annual comparison of drug approvals in the European Union (EU) and the USA.</p>
<p>As well as highlighting the continued differences between the two regions, the NDA Group argues that the figures reflect the need for a global approach to drug development to ensure success across both continents.</p>
<p>The report is based on preliminary research figures distilled from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites in January and February 2021, and found that the positive trend in approvals observed over the last couple of years took a noticeable leap forward in 2020.</p>
<p>For 2020, there were a total of 133 new drug approvals granted in the USA and EU, an impressive increase against recent years&rsquo; average.</p>
<p>Of these new products, 51 were approved only in the EU, 71 only in the USA, and 11 were granted in both regions. Some 69 of the drugs were classified as novel drugs, of which 20 were approved only in the EU, 48 only in the USA and one in both regions.</p>
<p>These figures indicate that last year was a year of significant differences in drug approvals across the two regions, where each region assessed and approved products that the other region did not, to a greater extent than has been the case in the last few years.</p>
<p><img title=""unnamed-1--2.jpg"" src=""/media/project_tpl/image/unnamed-1--2.jpg"" alt=""unnamed-1--2.jpg"" width=""566"" height=""800"" /></p>
<p>Johan Str&ouml;mquist, chief executive, NDA Group, said: &ldquo;It is encouraging to see that, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative drug developers were able to exceed previous years&rsquo; number of submissions, and that the drug regulators have been so productive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time, it is troubling to see the big difference in what products have actually been approved in the two regions. This discrepancy indicates that companies are not leveraging the opportunities available for parallel or closely sequential filings across the EU and USA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ingela Loell, NDA&rsquo;s researcher for the report, added: &ldquo;2020 will go down in history as the year of the pandemic, and it still did not put a damper on innovation. A lot of focus in the media has rightly been placed on the development of vaccines and treatments for infected, but 2020 really pushed the frontiers of advanced therapies and products with gene editing components.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw approvals of life-saving and life-changing treatments, like Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec), originally developed by AveXis and commercialized by Novartis (NOVN: VX), a gene therapy successfully addressing spinal muscular atrophy. Or Viltepso (viltolarsen) by NS Pharma, an exon 53 skipping treatment aiming to correct a naturally occurring genetic mutation of a protein aggravating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These are but two examples among many of how advanced therapies are continuing to make inroads into medical practice to change the lives of patients worldwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orphan drugs continue to dominate an important section of the new drug approvals, with 34% of the total products having an orphan designation. In spite of the advantages for companies to focus their development in this field, and the boom that we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, the proportion of orphan products remained pretty stable through 2020.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodeo's 15-PGDH program is a strong strategic fit with Amgen's inflammation portfolio and efforts to develop first-in-class therapeutics for patients, noted Amgen, whose shares closed down 2% at $249.75 yesterday.</p>
<p>This is the second M&amp;A deal for Amgen this month, having on March 2 announced a $1.9 billion offer for <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-replenishes-its-pipeline-with-1-9-billion-acquisition"">Five Prime Therapeutics</a> (Nasdaq: FPRX), that will bring in the latter&rsquo;s lead asset, bemarituzumab, a first-in-class, Phase III ready anti-FGFR2b antibody.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial terms of the offer</strong></h2>
<p>Amgen appears to hedging its bets, as it is offering only a modest upfront payment of $55 million for Rodeo, but the deal provides for future contingent milestone payments potentially worth up to an additional $666 million in cash. The transaction has been approved by the shareholders and the board of directors of Rodeo.</p>
<p>Rodeo is focused on developing first-in-class, orally available modulators of prostaglandin biology that play an important role in tissue regeneration and repair. Rodeo's lead 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) modulators have generated compelling data in extensive preclinical studies and have clinical potential in multiple indications.</p>
<p>""The enzyme 15-PGDH plays a key role in many disease-relevant processes such as stem cell self-renewal and epithelial barrier repair. Given the encouraging pre-clinical data to date, we are excited about the opportunity to develop a novel therapy with potential in a range of important inflammatory disease indications,"" said Raymond Deshaies, senior vice president of Global Research at Amgen.</p>
<p>Thong Q Le, president and chief executive of Rodeo, commented: ""We are thrilled that Amgen recognizes the potential value and differentiated profile of our 15-PGDH inhibitor program.

<p>Developed by Karyopharm Therapeutics (Nasdaq: KPTI), Nexpovio is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. This marks the first product authorization in Europe for Karyopharm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional marketing authorization is supported by data from the positive Phase IIb STORM study, which evaluated selinexor in adult patients with heavily pre-treated, triple class refractory multiple myeloma and was published in the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3111927-1&amp;h=2144283474&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1903455&amp;a=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine"">New England Journal of Medicine</a> in August 2019. Under the provisions of conditional approval by the EC, continued authorization for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial and is subject to additional monitoring. An EC marketing authorization through the centralized procedure (CP) is valid in all 27 European Union (EU) member countries, as well as the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>
<h2><strong>Previously approved in USA as Xpovio</strong></h2>
<p>Under the trade name Xpovio, the drug was approved in the USA in July 2019 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), and late last year for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Analysts suggest the drug could achieve over $700 million peak US sales in this indication.</p>
<p>""Nexpovio represents the first and only nuclear export inhibitor authorized in Europe and we are delighted to bring this new treatment option to eligible adult patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Despite advancements in the treatment of multiple myeloma, most adult patients will eventually relapse and develop disease that is refractory to all authorized therapies, further highlighting the urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanism of actions like Nexpovio,&rdquo; said Sharon Shacham, founder, president and chief scientific officer of Karyopharm.</p>
<p>In February this year, services provider Clinigen Group (AIM: CLIN) &lsquo;partnered with Karyopharm to provide selinexor on an unlicensed basis as part of a Named Patient Program, to patients outside the US with multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p>""Today's authorization is an important step forward in the international expansion of selinexor, now with marketing authorization for use in Europe, Israel and the US,"" said Dr Michael Kauffman, chief executive of Karyopharm. ""We are committed to making Nexpovio available in Europe initially through a Named Patient Program and are on track to submit a second European regulatory filing in April based on the positive data from the Phase III BOSTON study to potentially further expand Nexpovio to eligible adult patients in need of new treatment options,"" he added.</p>","2021-03-31 11:19:00","Conditional EC approval for Karyopharm’s Nexpovio","Karyopharm, Nexpovio, Selinexor, Approval, Conditional, European Commission, Myeloma, Multiple, Xpovio","Conditional EC approval for Karyopharm’s Nexpovio",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-31 11:18:15","2021-03-31 11:26:51",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/conditional-ec-approval-for-karyopharm-s-nexpovio,,,,,,karyopharm_large.png,karyopharm_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Hematology, Oncology","European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation","Europe, USA","Karyopharm Therapeutics","Nexpovio, selinexor, Xpovio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>A biosimilar to Roche&rsquo;s (ROG: SIX) Avastin, Oyavas is now available to oncologists and their patients in Germany and the Netherlands, while launches in other European countries will follow soon, depending in part on national pricing and reimbursement clearance.</p>
<p>The Oyavas launches in Germany and the Netherlands come immediately after receipt of a centralized marketing authorization from the European Commission. Under the terms of an agreement with mAbxience, STADA holds the marketing authorization and sales and marketing rights to Oyavas in around 40 European countries, including all 27 European Union member states.</p>
<h2><strong>Comprehensive biosimilars portfolio and pipeline</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Introducing Oyavas is testament to STADA&rsquo;s strategy of being a go-to-partner for enabling patient access to biosimilars in Europe,&rdquo; commented STADA chef executive Peter Goldschmidt, adding: &ldquo;Through partnerships, STADA has built a comprehensive biosimilars portfolio and pipeline, not only in oncology, but also in therapeutic areas such as autoimmune disorders, osteoporosis and ophthalmology, as the group continues to strengthen its presence in the specialty pharma sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>STADA has been engaged in bringing biosimilars to patients and healthcare professionals since founding the Bioceuticals Arzneimittel in 2000. The company thus makes a strong contribution to cost efficiency in healthcare systems. The company has 13 years of market experience with its Silapo (epoetin zeta) treatment for anemia, including in adults receiving chemotherapy, that has become one of STADA&rsquo;s best-selling products since its introduction in 2008 as one of Europe&rsquo;s first biosimilar launches.

<p>The latest <a href=""https://www.medicinesforeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Biosimilar%20Market%20Review-Final.pdf"">Biosimilar Market Review</a> provides a comprehensive overview of policies in 26 European countries focusing on availability, pricing systems, retail markets, hospital tendering, reimbursement systems,&nbsp; healthcare practitioner-related policies, information and education.</p>
<p>Since the first approval of a biosimilar medicine in 2006, we have accumulated over 2 billion patient treatment days in Europe alone, transforming treatment by enabling smart reinvestment of healthcare resources in better access to biological treatments while contributing to the sustainability of European healthcare budgets.</p>
<p>While there are still gaps in access across Europe, biosimilar medicine competition has massively increased the number of patients that can be treated. A recent IQVIA report on The Impact of Biosimilar Competition in Europe, highlighted the critical role that biosimilar medicines will play in the future as many more biological medicines are set to lose market (IP) exclusivity.</p>
<p>This should compel the European Union and member states to implement efficient, goal-oriented biosimilar medicine policies to improve patient access and healthcare sustainability. This should be based on highly successful benefit-sharing models that have proven the ability to stimulate competition and uptake.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the Biosimilar Market Review, Kelly Burke, chair of the biosimilar market access committee of Medicines for Europe said: &ldquo;The Biosimilar Market Review is an important resource for stakeholders and policy-makers interested in improving access to biological therapies. While progress has been made, it is clear much more can be done to leverage benefit-sharing for better access for patients and for a more sustainable healthcare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kazia has entered into a licensing agreement with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (HK: 2096) to develop and commercialize paxalisib in Greater China, that could earn the firm nearly $300 million.</p>
<h2><strong>Key Points of the accord</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Simcere will assume responsibility for the development, registration, and commercialization of paxalisib in Greater China - a territory which includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.</li>
<li>Kazia retains rights to the development and commercialization of paxalisib in all other territories and will continue to drive forward the GBM AGILE pivotal study as planned, including in China.</li>
<li>Under the terms of the agreement, Kazia will receive an upfront payment of $11 million, comprising $ 7million in cash and a $4 million equity investment, priced at a 20% premium to recent trading. Kazia will also receive contingent milestone payments of up to $281 million for glioblastoma, with further milestones payable for indications beyond glioblastoma. Simcere will additionally pay to Kazia mid-teen percentage royalties on commercial sales.</li>
<li>The transaction proceeds will be applied directly to the further development of paxalisib.</li>
<li>Paxalisib is currently the subject of six additional studies in other forms of brain cancer beyond glioblastoma.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Analyst sees advantages for both companies</strong></h2>
<p>This is a key development for Kazia because not only does this payment help alleviate the near-term financing needs of the company, but the deal illustrates the potential value of this asset to partners, noted Dr Nathaniel Calloway, an analyst at Edison Group.</p>
<p>Paxalisib, by virtue of being in the Phase II/III GBM AGILE study, will be the most advanced development asset Simcere has in licensed, as its other clinical programs are in Phase I or earlier, commented Dr Calloway, who forecasts peak sales of paxalisib in the glioblastoma indication of $450 million.</p>
<p>Kazia chief executive Dr James Garner commented: &ldquo;China is one of the world&rsquo;s largest pharmaceutical markets, with specific requirements and opportunities for innovative oncology products. We are delighted to partner with Simcere to secure the commercial success of paxalisib in this critical territory.

<p>Merck is reviewing the letter and will discuss next steps with the FDA. An anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda is by far Merck&rsquo;s biggest-selling drug, generated sales of $14.4 billion last year.</p>
<p>The application was based on pCR data and early interim event-free survival (EFS) findings from the Phase III KEYNOTE-522 trial, which is continuing to evaluate for EFS. Ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the application, the FDA&rsquo;s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 10-0 that a regulatory decision should be deferred until further data are available from KEYNOTE-522. The next interim analysis is calendar-driven and will occur in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Backing data seen as &ldquo;questionable&rdquo; by FDA</strong></h2>
<p>Keytruda&rsquo;s chances as a monotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer were always a longshot after the FDA offered a stinging rebuke of the drug&rsquo;s pivotal dataset, which it called &ldquo;questionable&rdquo; given immature overall survival data and some wishy-washy efficacy numbers, according to ODAC briefing documents at the time, noted Kyle Blankenship, writing on EndPoints News.</p>
<p>However, a spekesperson for Merck clarified that&nbsp;the study design of KEYNOTE-522 tested Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant (pre-operative) treatment, then as a single agent as adjuvant (post-operative treatment) after surgery.</p>
<p>This CRL does not impact any current approved indications for Keytruda, including the indication for the drug in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] &ge;10), as determined by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on progression-free survival.

<p>Kesimpta is a targeted B-cell therapy being developed and marketed worldwide by Novartis under a license agreement with Genmab.</p>
<p>The therapy has shown superior efficacy with a similar safety profile compared with teriflunomide, an oral multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy sold by Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) as Aubagio.</p>
<p>Uniquely, Kesimpta is the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home, using a special autoinjector pen.</p>
<h2>Kesimpta development</h2>
<p>EU approval for Kesimpta has been granted for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features.</p>
<p>The regulatory nod was based on data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II trials, which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The decision comes more than six months after the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the treatment in this indication.</p>
<p>Novartis hopes that the novel, patient-friendly mode of administration will help it to differentiate the offering from another anti-CD20 antibody on the market, the intravenous therapy Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), from fellow Swiss firm Roche (ROG: SIX).</p>
<p>With Ocrevus boasting impressive levels of efficacy, Novartis will face stiff competition. Roche&rsquo;s offering - which also has a lower wholesale acquisition cost - is expected by analysts to be the market leader by 2026.</p>
<p>Commenting on the EU approval, Genmab chief executive Jan van de Winkel said: &ldquo;We are extremely pleased that Kesimpta is now approved in both Europe and in the USA, providing RMS patients with a convenient, efficacious and safe treatment option as demonstrated in the study findings from the ASCLEPIOS trials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also known as cholangiocarcinoma, the rare type of cancer is often diagnosed at a late or advanced stage when the prognosis is poor.</p>
<p>It affects between 6,000 and 8,000 people in Europe.</p>
<p>The decision was widely anticipated, after a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s scientific body in January 2021.</p>
<p>The firm has secured conditional marketing authorization (CMA), and may be required to provide confirmatory data in the future.</p>
<h2>Breakthrough option</h2>
<p>The decision from the European regulator comes around a year after the US Food and Drug Administration gave the green light under the similar Accelerated Approval scheme, making it the first and only FDA-approved treatment for this indication.</p>
<p>At the same time, the US FDA approved FoundationOne CDx, a companion diagnostic for Pemazyre which is designed to help identify people with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements who may be eligible for treatment with Pemazyre.</p>

<p>In an official letter sent to the Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin by members<em> Infarma</em>, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading pharma trade association which unites some global producers - among which are Bayer (BAYN: DE), Roche (ROG: SIX), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Novartis NOVN: VX) - those measures taken by Russian authorities to minimize the ongoing patent disputes in the domestic pharmaceutical market are still imperfect, while new tools should be designed.</p>
<h2><strong>Major problems with existing drug register</strong></h2>
<p>According to producers, perhaps one of the major problems for their business in Russia is associated with the existing drug register, which is formed by the Russian Federal Service for Intellectual Property (Rospatent).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As producers believe, the register is created to reduce the illegal production of generics during the lifetime of patents for original drugs. However, according to them, in its original form, the register was created as a formal list of drug names without linking them to patents.</p>
<p>The Association in its letter asks PM Mishustin to make a number of changes to the existing regulations, particularly those which regulate the design of a register and public procurement mechanisms by Rospatent.</p>
<p>In addition, the association asks the Prime Minister to initiate the process of recognizing the formal status of the register by other countries of the Eurasian Economic Space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the initiative of pharmaceutical companies has already been opposed by patient organizations in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sergei Golovin, head of the Medicines Accessibility Department at the Treatment Preparedness Coalition, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading patent public associations, said in an interview with local <em>Kommersant</em> business paper, this is an excessive measure that can negatively affect the current range of drugs available in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to him, strict patent linkage, which is demanded by producers, can lead to a sharp reduction in the production of generics, as the Russian Ministry of Health may stop accepting applications for registration of such drugs before the expiration of patents for original ones.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Restrictive measures rarely imposed</strong></h2>
<p>At present, restrictive measures are rarely imposed on the release and sale of contested generic drugs in Russia. For example, in 2020, 4.860 packages of Bayer&rsquo;s cancer drug Nexavar (sorafenib) were sold on the local market for a total sum of 569 million roubles ($7.5 million). This, however, was significantly lower than the 11.700 packs of ""Sorafenib-nativ"" (worth 1.3 billion roubles) - a generic drug based on Nexavar produced by the Russian pharmaceutical company Nativa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, Bayer has refused to localize the production of the drug in Russia. As for Nativa, the company currently remains a leader in Russia in terms of number of judicial proceedings with foreign drugmakers due to the release of generics before the expiration of patents for original drugs.</p>","2021-03-30 12:03:00","Global drugmakers again demand better protection of patent rights in R","Patents, Protection, Rospatent, Register, Infarma, Bayer, Nexavar, Nativa","Global drugmakers again demand better protection of patent rights in Russia",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-30 12:02:06","2021-03-30 12:09:42",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/global-drugmakers-again-demand-better-protection-of-patent-rights-in-russia,,,,,,russia_li.jpg,russia_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Generics, Pharmaceutical",,"Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Patents & Trademarks, Russian market",Russia,"Bayer, Nativa","Nexavar, Sorafenib",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The FAP assets were originally developed at the University of Heidelberg. The agreement also includes co-exclusive rights for Novartis to develop imaging applications for these assets. Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Novartis has established global expertise and specialized supply chain and manufacturing capabilities across its network of four radioligand therapy production sites, and is further increasing capacity to ensure delivery of radioligand therapies such as <sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-617, which came to Novartis with its $2.1 billion acquisition of Endocyte in 2018.</p>
<p>Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell-surface protein expressed at low levels in most normal adult tissues, but over-expressed in common cancers, particularly on cancer-associated fibroblasts that form the tumor stroma, which is essential for growth. High FAP expression on cancer-associated fibroblasts is generally associated with worse prognosis in solid tumors due to promotion of tumorigenesis and progression.</p>
<h2><strong>FAP is an &lsquo;exciting target&rsquo;</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to invest in radioligand therapy as one of the four unique platforms of Novartis Oncology. We believe working across multiple approaches is the key to reimagining cancer care,&rdquo; said Susanne Schaffert, president, Novartis Oncology. &ldquo;FAP is an exciting target and these agents are a great fit with our radioligand therapy pipeline, which we are actively investigating across multiple tumor types. We believe this technology has the potential to transform many patients&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Targeted radioligand therapy is a type of precision medicine combining two key elements: a targeting compound, or ligand, and a radioactive isotope, causing DNA damage that inhibits tumor growth and replication. These targeted drugs bind to markers or proteins over-expressed by certain tumors, or tumor-associated tissue, such as stroma. Due to the high-affinity of these agents for specific tumor cells or associated tumor tissue, surrounding healthy tissue is less affected.</p>","2021-03-30 11:11:00","Novartis Oncology expands radioligand pipeline with exclusive worldwid","Novartis Oncology, Agreement, Rights, iTheranostics, Radioligands, 177Lu-PSMA-617","Novartis Oncology expands radioligand pipeline with exclusive worldwide rights",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-30 11:10:36","2021-03-30 11:20:14",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-oncology-expands-radioligand-pipeline-with-exclusive-worldwide-rights,,,,,,novartis_sign_large.jpg,novartis_sign_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Deals, Licensing, Research","Switzerland, USA","iTheranostics, Novartis, Sofie Biosciences",177Lu-PSMA-617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The petition notes bedaquiline and delamanid, together with repurposed drugs linezolid and clofazimine, provide opportunities to cure people with MDR TB.</p>
<p>Through their counsel Anand Grover, the petitioners said if the government authorizes other manufacturers by giving them the patents, the shortage problem could be resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The petitioners told the court that, in 2019 alone, 44,724 MDR-TB patients eligible to receive bedaquiline did not get the drug and 830 patients with XDR-TB did not receive delamanid.</p>
<p>The Court has asked the Ministry of Health and other departments to explain if it is feasible to invoke compulsory licensing (CL) to prevent big pharma from monopolizing production of these drugs.</p>
<p>The move for CL has been seconded by activists fighting for expanded access to these drugs, as they are concerned at the lack of transparency with which the Indian government has procured the drug and the government&rsquo;s reliance on a donation program, where patients must depend on the generosity of a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<h2><strong>Drug donations</strong></h2>
<p>Senior advocate Anand Grover said after the World Health Organization (WHO) had approved bedaquiline and delamanid as essential drugs for treating MDR and XDR TB, the patent for the medicines had been given to individual nations. After India received the patent, the same was given to two different pharmaceutical companies to undertake the manufacturing of the drugs.</p>
<p>The petitioners have said the government is currently relying on donations from patent holders - the US-based Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals for bedaquiline and Japan&rsquo;s Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (TYO: 4578) for delamanid - and procure a ""miniscule quantity"" of the drugs compared to what India needs.</p>
<p>As the cost of the drugs was high and generic drugs were not allowed to be imported, the companies were asked to give the drugs as donations to the government to be used to treat patients. However, due to the high number of patients in India, the government was also forced to procure the medicines at a high price, the petition noted.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Indian government received 600 courses of bedaquiline from Janssen followed by 22,000 courses from USAID (US Agency for International Development). Similarly, the program received 400 courses of delamanid as donation from Otsuka.</p>
<p>A six-month course of bedaquiline costs around $358.15 and delamanid costs up to $1259.34 per course, according to the petition, implying that the government would have to shell out huge amounts for the treatment for a single patient being treated under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) also now known as the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) in India.</p>
<p>Grover said that as generic drugs are available for $8.25 to $17.54 per month for both medicines, the government should issue CL so that other manufacturers can get patents and the burden on the government is reduced.</p>
<p>The petition noted the Subject Expert Committee of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has also approved their use under programmatic conditions, and the NTEP has included them in the guidelines for the programmatic management of MDR TB in India. However, due to the high cost and procurement problems, TB patients have been facing shortage of these drugs.</p>
<p>A team of UK researchers have estimated that generic production could slash the price of both drugs to below $137.62 per patient for a six-month course.</p>
<h2><strong>Generic capability&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Each year nearly two million people in India develop TB, of which around 0.87 million are infectious cases. This has led to an increase in the production and marketing of TB drugs in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indian pharma major Lupin (BSE: 500257) has been the trail blazer and remains the undisputed global heavy weight in the anti-TB drugs space. Apart from India, where the company has close to 50% market share (according to IMS Health), India is also a global leader in drugs like rifampicin, where the country has close to 80% global market share.</p>
<p>Commenting on the generic TB drugs availability in the Indian market, an analyst said R-Cinex (isoniazid/rifampin) manufactured by Lupin, and Forecox (ethambutol + Isoniazid) manufactured by Macleods are two of the most widely prescribed anti-TB drugs in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, they capture close to 15% of the market share in India. Other brands like AKT-4, Combutol, Akurit -4, Pyzina are also prescribed, and together these four brands capture more than 20% of the market sales of anti-TB drugs. They are all manufactured by Lupin.</p>
<p>Though several manufacturers in India have said they have the capacity and technology to make generic versions of both the patented drugs, no licensing pacts have emerged yet, the petitioners have pointed out.</p>
<h2><strong>Political cries</strong></h2>
<p>Political parties too have added their voice. Congress MP TN Prathapan has said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that there is an urgent need to start domestic production of generic medicines required to treat MDR TB.</p>
<p>""Instead of taking steps to start domestic generic production of these essential medicines, the RNTCP is depending on donations and charity pricing from the originator companies to treat patients,"" Mr Prathapan said.</p>
<p>""The dependency on donation is one of the important barriers in the scaling up of treatment. If the status quo remains, India will not achieve the target of ending TB by 2025,"" Mr Prathapan said, adding the two medicines should be made available to all patients of MDR TB, and that the medicines should be a part of the national list of essential medicines.</p>

<p>More than &pound;830 million ($1.14 billion) in fresh capital was raised in the three months to the end of February, almost topping the &pound;894 million raised in the first six months of 2020, which itself was a record-breaking year.</p>
<p>Global investors continue to recognise the high potential of UK science, with both public and private companies securing large investments to finance their R&amp;D programs and accelerate the delivery of innovative medicines to patients.</p>
<p>Highlights from the data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;336 million was raised in venture capital between December 2020 and February 2021, up from &pound;123 million in the same period a year ago;</li>
<li>&pound;215 million was raised through initial public offerings (IPOs), up from &pound;0 a year ago; and</li>
<li>&pound;279 million was raised through follow-on financings, up from &pound;186 million a year ago</li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to the news, BIA chief executive Steve Bates noted: &ldquo;This strong start to 2021, with investments outpacing the record setting year of 2020, shows the incredible appetite amongst international and some domestic investors for the UK&rsquo;s world leading biotech and life sciences companies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been reinforced by the recent announcement that &pound;1 billion will be invested in the sector through a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uae-investment-a-boost-for-uk-life-sciences"">UAE-UK Sovereign Investment Partnership.</a> This quarter has also seen significant private sector investments into UK medicine manufacturing capability and clinical development pipelines, which has fuelled increased confidence in the sectors outlook for 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Globally, &pound;7.2 billion venture capital has been invested into private biotech companies, &pound;888m of it in Europe. The UK accounted for almost 38% of the European total.</p>
<p><strong>UK biotech is providing strong returns for investors</strong></p>
<p>Alongside the high levels of investment, the UK&rsquo;s maturing biotech sector is providing strong returns for its financial backers.</p>
<p>An analysis by Radnor Capital Partners on behalf of the BIA found that biotech companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange have out-performed the FTSE-All Share by 256% in the past year (unweighted), with listed collective investment vehicles, which are favored by retail investors because they diversify risk, rising 60.4% compared to the FTSE All-Share.</p>
<p>As markets have started to rebound as the pandemic in the UK eases, the sector has continued to outperform, with the FTSE All-Share rising by only 4% against 24% for the quoted biotech sector (unweighted, or 14% on a market cap weighted basis).</p>
<p>With the new UK financial tax year soon to begin, sector experts are confident that UK biotech and life sciences companies, as well as funds dedicated to investing into the sector, will be a more popular location for retail investors.</p>","2021-03-30 10:27:00","UK biotech set for another year of record-breaking investment","BioIndustry Association, BIA, Clarivate, Fundraising, IPOs, Venture capital, Investors, Returns","UK biotech set for another year of record-breaking investment",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-30 09:04:17","2021-03-30 10:27:33",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uk-biotech-set-for-another-year-of-record-breaking-investment,,,,,,bia_logo_large.jpg,bia_logo_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,,"Business Financing",UK,"BIA, Clarivate Analytics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>According to Mr Eder, over the past 15 years, STADA has invested over $1 billion in the Russian and CIS market, including a record $660 million on the purchase of Takeda's portfolio in 2020.</p>
<p>Mr Eder said in the next three years, the company plans to invest 13 million euros ($15.3 million) to increase the capacities of its local production sites of Nizhpharm and Hemofarm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, the level of localization of STADA in Russia is estimated at 70%, which is one of the highest figures among the other global drugmakers operating in the local market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Mr Eder has also noted, currently the company continues the transfer of technologies to Nizhpharm from its production sites in Serbia and the UK for the production of soft dosage forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drugs transferred from Serbia will be produced at a volume of more than 1 million units per year and will be delivered mainly to the Balkans and the CIS countries. The drugs transferred from the UK will be produced at almost 2 million units per year and will be supplied to the markets of seven countries, including the UK, UAE, Yemen.</p>
<p>Next year, the company will complete the transfer of the technology for the production of drugs that are now manufactured at Takeda factories in Ireland and Germany to the Russian Hemofarm. That will be six drugs with a production volume of up to 13 million packs per year.</p>

<p>uniQure today announced the results of a comprehensive investigation into the case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed in one patient in the HOPE-B pivotal trial of etranacogene dezaparvovec.</p>
<p>Multiple analyses conducted by an independent laboratory and reviewed by leading external experts in the field show that AAV vector integration in the patient&rsquo;s tissue sample was extremely rare and accounted for 0.027% of the cells in the sample. The integration events were distributed randomly across the genome, and there was no evidence of clonal expansion or any dominant integration event. Additionally, whole genome sequencing of the tumor confirmed that the patient had several genetic mutations that are characteristic of HCC and are independent of vector integration. Finally, gene expression analysis of the tumor and adjacent tissue suggested a precancerous state in the liver consistent with several risk factors that predispose this patient to HCC.</p>
<h2><strong>Follows FDA clinical hold in December</strong></h2>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration placed a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clinical-hold-on-uniqure-s-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-program"">clinical hold on uniQure&rsquo;s hemophilia B program</a> following the submission of a safety report in mid-December 2020 of a possibly related serious adverse event associated with a preliminary diagnosis of HCC in one patient in the HOPE-B trial. The patient has multiple risk factors associated with HCC, including a twenty-five-year history of hepatitis C (HCV), history of hepatitis B (HBV), evidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, history of smoking, familial history of cancer and advanced age. Chronic infections with hepatitis B and C have been associated with approximately 80% of HCC cases.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><em>Data from investigation was submitted to the FDA on March 26, 2021 ~</em></p>
<p>Dr David Lillicrap, Professor of the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen&rsquo;s University, Kingston, Canada, stated: &ldquo;The investigations that have been performed have shown no evidence to suggest that the AAV vector delivered in the HOPE-B study has played a pathogenic role in the hepatocellular cancer that has now been diagnosed in the patient,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The external lab analyzed more than 220,000 cells from the tissue sample and identified 60 cells with random integration events that have no known association with the development of HCC,&rdquo; stated Ricardo Dolmetsch, president of R&amp;D at uniQure. &ldquo;Moreover, whole genome sequencing of the tumor showed that this patient had large abnormalities on chromosomes 1 and 8 that are commonly associated with HCC, as well as mutation of TP53 and several other potentially oncogenic genes,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken together, the findings from this investigation strongly suggest that etranacogene dezaparvovec did not contribute to this case of HCC,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We have now shared these data with the FDA and are prepared to have further communications regarding the status of the clinical hold in the second quarter of 2021. We also expect to submit the data for presentation at an upcoming industry conference yet to be determined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the results from this very thorough investigation involving an independent lab and several expert reviews, we believe it is very unlikely that etranacogene dezaparvovec is related to the HCC event in the HOPE-B study,&rdquo; stated Matt Kapusta, chief executive of uniQure. &ldquo;Patient safety will always be our top priority, and we are prepared to discuss with the FDA the recently submitted analyses and the status of the clinical hold as expeditiously as possible. As stated previously, we do not anticipate any impact to the HOPE-B pivotal study or our regulatory submission timeline as a result of the clinical hold,&rdquo; he added.</p>","2021-03-29 14:51:00","New uniQure findings likely to diffuse hemophilia B gene therapy scare","uniQure, Etranacogene dezaparvovec, HOPE-B trial, Investigation, HCC, FDA, Clinical hold, Hemophilia B","New uniQure findings likely to diffuse hemophilia B gene therapy scare",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-29 14:51:03","2021-03-29 14:57:50",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-uniqure-findings-likely-to-diffuse-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-scare,,,,,,uniqure_hq_big.jpg,uniqure_hq_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology","Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA","Netherlands, USA",uniQure,"etranacogene dezaparvovec",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<h2><strong>What is amyloidosis?</strong></h2>
<p>Amyloidosis represents a group of disorders characterized by deposition of insoluble protein fibrils (amyloid) into the patient&rsquo;s organs, leading to dysfunction. Although technically classified as a rare disease, amyloidosis has three distinct subtypes &ndash; AL (primary), AA (secondary), and ATTR. About 4,000 new cases are believed to be diagnosed annually in the United States alone.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The most common subtype of amyloidosis, the AL type, has an estimated prevalence rate of 40.5 cases per million person years, and the incidence has been steadily increasing at the rate of 12% per year.<sup>2</sup> With rising statistics, the disease remains poorly understood, and concerns remain about the current methods of managing this condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How is amyloidosis diagnosed?</strong></h2>
<p>Amyloidosis diagnosis can be challenging. Indeed, 20% of AL amyloidosis patients experience a delay in diagnosis by as much as two years, while the wait is around 42% in patients suffering from the cardiac ATTRwt subtype of amyloidosis.<sup>3 </sup>While case history and clinical evaluation are taken into account, diagnosis is primarily made through a tissue biopsy. Once diagnosed, clinical subtyping of the disease is necessary, as this forms the basis of the management strategy. Another factor to be considered is the severity of amyloid-related organ dysfunction, especially advanced cardiac complications.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Once identified, the focus of treatment is to rescue organ function by suppressing the production of amyloidogenic free light chains (FLCs) and to minimize treatment-related mortality and morbidity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What is the current state of AL amyloidosis management?</strong></h2>
<p>For AL amyloidosis, a risk assessment is usually performed at the outset to inform management. The risk assessment primarily takes cardiac status into account, but also considers peripheral neuropathy, renal status and lung disease. A decade ago, the mainstay of treatment for patients was chemotherapy with high dose melphalan and dexamethasone (Mdex). At least 33% of patients receiving this therapy were known to recover completely, while organ function improved in 48% of patients and hematologic response improved in 67% of patients.<sup>5</sup> However, this therapy was associated with high morbidity rates, including the development of leukemia.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, low risk patients, who comprise about 20% of all AL amyloidosis patients, are managed with Autologous Stem Cell transplantation (ASCT). While initially associated with high mortality rates, careful risk assessment and patient selection has decreased mortality. ASCT can produce complete response in 35-37% of all patients, and hematological response in 71% of patients.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Are there any novel treatments for AL amyloidosis?</strong></h2>
<p>ASCT is highly dependent on patient selection. Novel treatments are emerging for patients who do not meet the selection criteria, as well as for intermediate or high-risk patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Velcade (bortezomib; from Millennium/Takeda (TYO: 4502) and Janssen, a Johnson &amp; Johnson [NYSE: JNJ] company), a proteasome inhibitor, is becoming increasingly common as a pre-induction therapy before ASCT, or for &lsquo;consolidation&rsquo; after ASCT treatment. Bortezomib is also effective as monotherapy, but combinations with dexamethasone have shown better rates of progression-free survival.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Novel treatments have also looked at replacing the use of Alkeran (melphalan) in intermediate risk patients, who form about 65% of all AL amyloidosis patients. Bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone can provide a hematological response rate of 81%, which is comparable to bortezomib and Mdex, and superior to Mdex alone.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent studies have evaluated Darzalex (daratumumab; from Janssen Oncology), an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody originally used for multiple myeloma, for intermediate risk patients. Daratumumab has shown high rates of hematologic response (76 to 78%), a good response time, and a toxicity that is similar to that seen in multiple myeloma patients.<sup>10 </sup>High risk patients, who form the remaining 15 to 20% of patients, have limited treatment options that improve their long-term prognosis. Low-dose treatment with bortezomib is preferred and, if tolerated, newer therapeutic agents may be introduced.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Several novel drugs have been introduced for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Thalidomide derivatives, including Revlimid (lenalidomide; Bristol Myers Squibb [NYSE: BMY]) and Imnovid (pomalidomide; Celgene) have demonstrated reasonable hematologic response rates. However, lenalidomide has been associated with renal dysfunction at higher doses.<sup>12 </sup>A new, oral proteasome inhibitor, Ninlaro (ixazomib; Millennium Pharmaceuticals/Takeda), has shown promise in relapse-refractory AL. It has also been shown to achieve a hematologic response in 52% and an organ response in 56% of patients.<sup>12</sup></p>
<h2><strong>Are there any investigational treatments for AL amyloidosis?</strong></h2>
<p>A proteasome inhibitor, Kyprolis (carfilzomib; from Amgen [Nasdaq: AMGN]), is currently being evaluated for AL amyloidosis patients who have peripheral neuropathy (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02545907"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT02545907). Another monoclonal antibody, Empliciti (elotuzumab; from Bristol Myers Squibb), is already approved to treat relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. In a single case report, elotuzumab achieved both hematologic and organ responses in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.<sup>13</sup> An ongoing clinical trial is evaluating the efficacy of elotuzumab and cyclophosphamide in relapsed AL amyloidosis (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT03252600).</p>
<p>Venetoclax (VCL) is a selective oral antineoplastic, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor agent, approved for use in leukemia and multiple myeloma. VCL has produced promising findings in a single-center, retrospective study of 8 patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis with heart complications.<sup>14</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup>However, a Phase I trial (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT03000660) examining VCL in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed AL amyloidosis has been suspended due to the availability of data from another study indicating an increased risk of death with the agent (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: BELLINI trial: NCT02755597).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A newer monoclonal antibody being evaluated is CAEL-101, which can directly bind to human light chain amyloid fibrils to break down deposits. CAEL-101 has shown encouraging organ responses in Phase I trials, with cardiac function improving in 9 out 10 patients.<sup>15</sup> A Phase II multicenter study of CAEL-101, in combination with CyBorD (Cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone), in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis, is in the pipeline (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT04304144). &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What is the current status of the management of AA and ATTR amyloidosis?</strong></h2>
<p>In the hereditary ATTR subtype of amyloidosis, the amyloid (transthyretin) is largely produced by the liver. Therefore, liver transplantation has been the treatment of choice. Conversely, since AA amyloidosis is associated with chronic inflammatory disease, the focus of management is the suppression of underlying inflammation. However, both of these standard therapies do not always prevent disease progression in other organ systems. Therefore, novel treatments are being sought that aim to retard or halt disease progression by preventing amyloid deposition or removing deposits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vyndaqel (tafamidis; from Pfizer [NYSE: PFE]) prevents amyloid deposition by binding to the transthyretin tetramer and preventing its dissociation (which is the first step in amyloid deposition). The drug has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular related hospitalizations in ATTR patients by about 30%.<sup>16</sup> Tafamidis is now Food and Drug Administration approved to treat both wild-type and mutated TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, has transthyretin binding capabilities and has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of neurological impairment and improve quality of life.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two recently approved drugs, Onpattro (patisiran; from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals [Nasdaq: ALNY]) and Tegsedi (inotersen; Akcea), are &lsquo;gene silencers.&rsquo; which prevent the synthesis of amyloid at the molecular level. In patients with hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy, an 18-month patisiran therapy was shown to significantly improve neuropathy, quality of life, and cardiac complications.<sup>18 </sup>Inotersen has also been shown to slow disease progression and improve quality of life.<sup>19</sup> However, inotersen is associated with adverse effects, including glomerulonephritis and thrombopenia in about 3% of all patients; hence, regular laboratory monitoring may be required.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Eprodisate is the only clinically proven drug to inhibit AA amyloid fibrillogenesis. It has been shown to reduce the risk of renal dysfunction by about 42%, but does not appear to reduce risk of end stage renal failure or mortality.<sup>20</sup></p>
<h2><strong>Are there any investigational treatments for ATTR and AA amyloidosis?</strong></h2>
<p>Tasmar (tolcapone; Meda Pharmaceuticals), primarily used as an adjunctive treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, has higher affinity for transthyretin than tafamidis and is also a better inhibitor of transthyretin aggregation. Since it can cross the blood-brain barrier, its efficacy is currently being evaluated for leptomeningeal amyloidosis (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT03591757).&nbsp;</p>
<p>An upcoming promising &lsquo;gene silencer&rsquo; is vutrisiran (Alnylam), which, in comparison with patisiran has shown better hepatic uptake despite a lower administration volume, promising better efficacy and stability<strong>. </strong>Vutrisiran also has a good safety profile.<sup>21</sup> Currently, two randomized Phase III trials are underway comparing the efficacy and safety of vutrisiran and patisiran in ATTRv patients with neurological (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03759379"">ClinicalTrials.gov HELIOS-A</a>: NCT03759379) and cardiac manifestations (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04153149"">ClinicalTrials.gov HELIOS-B</a>: NCT04153149).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For AA amyloidosis, a specially designed new drug, NC-503, is undergoing Phase II/III trials for efficacy and safety (<a href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00035334"">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>: NCT00035334). This drug binds to amyloidogenic precursor proteins and prevents tissue deposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another potential method of treatment is to use therapies that would degrade amyloid deposits after they are formed. Doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has been shown to disrupt ATTR amyloid in mouse models. Further clinical trials testing doxycycline along with plasma cell-directed treatment are in progress.</p>
<h2><strong>Biologics &ndash; an era of hope for amyloidosis&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Systemic amyloidosis has long presented a challenge to patients and physicians, both for diagnosis and optimal modes of management. The recent introduction of targeted biologics for all subtypes of amyloidosis promises new hope to patients living with amyloidosis. While earlier treatments were focused on removing the source of amyloid synthesis and lowering amyloid precursor proteins, newer classes of drugs being developed are targeting interference with amyloid deposition and degradation of existing deposits. This offers hope not only for improved survival, but also improved organ functioning and better quality for life for patients.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy endpoint was met with an exceptionally high statistical significance and there were no treatment related safety events.</p>
<p>Destiny&rsquo;s shares shot up 57%to 250 pence in pre-market trading following the news.</p>
<p>There is a global need for better treatments such as XF-73, which has been awarded Qualifying Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track status by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical study results highlights</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Met primary endpoint: XF-73 reduced the mean nasal burden of <em> aureus </em>in patients undergoing open heart surgery by 2.5 log (CFU/ml) in the 24 hours immediately before surgery in the micro-ITT (Intend to Treat) population, a statistically highly-significant result, (p&lt;0.0001). This equates to a 99.5% reduction in <em>S. aureus</em> bacterial nasal carriage which is a very effective reduction by accepted clinical measures.</li>
<li>XF-73 showed 2.1 log, (&gt;99%), greater reduction than placebo in the same patient population and this difference in reduction of nasal burden of <em> aureus </em>was statistically highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) in both the micro-ITT and per protocol populations. The effect was maintained during surgery, considered the period when the risk for infections is the highest.</li>
<li>Initial analysis of secondary endpoints shows a higher reduction of burden of nasal <em> aureus </em>in the XF-73 arm compared to placebo arm in the 24 hours before surgery, and this was also observed when the data was analyzed by area under the curve (AUC) and percentage of patients reaching a specific log reduction.&nbsp;</li>
<li>These positive results were achieved with just four doses of 0.2% (w/w) XF-73 nasal gel in the 24 hours before incision and the start of surgery.</li>
<li>There were no treatment related adverse events.</li>
<li>Full results will be published in due course in a peer reviewed journal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Destiny Pharma now plans to discuss possible Phase III clinical study designs with regulatory bodies including the US FDA.

<p>For several years, European officials have debated a proposal for European Union level collaboration on joint clinical assessments, and negotiations with the European Parliament have now been initiated.</p>
<p>The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) said that the decision to begin negotiations with lawmakers implies &ldquo;a common position of the member states on the file and the willingness to start trialogue negotiations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the proposals have been received &ldquo;with an abundance of caution by member states,&rdquo; the EFPIA said.</p>
<p>The original proposal was for an efficient process for joint clinical assessments, including a reliable commitment on the part of EU member states to &ldquo;actually use the assessments that were jointly established at EU-level as the basis of national decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In contrast, the compromise text going into negotiations provides &ldquo;a maximum of flexibility for member states in how they intend to use the joint assessment,&rdquo; the EFPIA said.</p>
<p>The trade body, which represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry operating across Europe, is concerned about a lack of predictability for all parties, leading to suboptimal use of limited capacity for such assessments.</p>
<p>Director general Nathalie Moll said: &ldquo;We are at an important point in the legislative negotiations of the European HTA Regulation and we find ourselves still coming up short on one of the most important ingredients for a well-functioning system of joint clinical assessments: trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;As such, it is important to give ourselves the tools and time to achieve that trust. One tested method is to foresee enough opportunities to evaluate and adjust the work being carried out and learn together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, what we all want is a system that improves the availability of innovative technologies for patients.&rdquo;</p>

488175,,"FDA approves first CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma","The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel), a first-in-class B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically-modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","<p>The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel), a first-in-class B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically-modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>Abecma is the first cell-based gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the agency pointed out.</p>
<p>News of the approval saw shares of the product&rsquo;s developers - US pharma major Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and biotech firm bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE) - edge up 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively, and also marks a significant milestone for BMS, making the latter the only company with two approved CAR-T cell therapies with two distinct targets; last month<a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-breyanzi-new-treatment-for-b-cell-lymphoma""> Breyanzi</a> (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cell) was approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer. Despite advancements in treatment, most patients relapse after initial therapies, and with each successive treatment, the depth and duration of response as well as survival outcomes decrease. Patients who have been exposed to three classes of treatment (triple-class exposed) have even poorer survival outcomes. As the first and only approved anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy, Abecma addresses a critical unmet need and offers patients a new, personalized therapeutic option, the companies noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Provides a new treatment option</strong></h2>
<p>Dr Peter Marks, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, commented: &ldquo;While there is no cure for multiple myeloma, the long-term outlook can vary based on the individual&rsquo;s age and the stage of the condition at the time of diagnosis. Today&rsquo;s approval provides a new treatment option for patients who have this uncommon type of cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CAR-T cell therapies have shown transformational potential for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, and we, with our partners at bluebird bio, are proud to bring the first CAR-T cell therapy to appropriate triple-class exposed patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, offering the chance for durable response,&rdquo; said Dr Samit Hirawat, chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb, adding: &ldquo;As our second FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, Abecma underscores our commitment to deliver on the promise of cell therapies for patients who are battling aggressive and advanced blood cancers with limited effective treatment options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our journey to today&rsquo;s approval of Abecma started nearly a decade ago with pioneering research at bluebird bio and has been driven ever since by our mission to provide patients with multiple myeloma a new approach to fight this relentless disease,&rdquo; said Nick Leschly, chief bluebird, bluebird bio. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement represents an important milestone for bluebird bio, marking both our first approved treatment in oncology and our first approved treatment in the United States,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>A network has been created to support rapid and dependable manufacturing of Abecma and ensure capacity to accommodate patient demand. Abecma&nbsp;will be manufactured for each individual patient using the patient&rsquo;s own T cells at Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s state-of-the-art cellular immunotherapy manufacturing facility in Summit, New Jersey. The lentiviral vector, which is used to engineer the CAR-T cells, was developed by bluebird bio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eleven gene sequences s howed deletions (loss of genetic material) in the initial region of the protein and in four there was some amino acids insertion. The Spike protein is associated with the pathogen's ability to enter human cells and is one of the main targets of the neutralizing antibodies produced by the body to block the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The institution says that one of the effects of this change is contributing to maintaining the critical scenario in the occupation of hospital beds. The greater presence of young people admitted to hospitals is reported by health professionals from different regions. This week's Fiocruz bulletin translates this impression into numbers, notes a report by The Rio Times. Cases in Brazil among young people has increased sixfold, the newspaper stated.</p>
<h2><strong>Necessary to continue monitoring</strong></h2>
<p>The scientists point out that, so far, few genomes show the changes and that it is not yet characterized as the formation of a Sars-CoV-2 new strain. However, they warn that it is necessary to continue monitoring to see if viruses with these changes will not increase in frequency.</p>
<p>""We can say that this is an early discovery, which emphasizes the importance of actions in genomic surveillance, such as the one carried out by the Fiocruz network,"" explains the head of Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses and Measles at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC/Fiocruz), researcher Marilda Siqueira. The Laboratory acts as a National Reference Center for respiratory viruses for the Ministry of Health and as a reference for the World Health Organization (WHO) in COVID-19 in the Americas.</p>
<p>The Fiocruz Genomics Network researchers warn that the findings highlight the urgent need to scale up vaccination and implement effective non-pharmacological measures to mitigate community transmission and the more transmissible variants emergence.

<p>Among last week&rsquo;s notable news, AstraZeneca released long-waited data from the US Phase III trial of its COVID-1 vaccine, AZD1222, which pave the way for US regulatory approval and restore confidence in Europe, but this was not without further controversy. Roche and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals reported strong Phase III data for their REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pfizer and Eli Lilly suffered a setback on their osteoarthritis pain drug tanezumab, with a negative Food and Drug Administration advisory committee vote. Dutch rare diseases firm ProQR Therapeutics announced encouraging early-stage results for its QR-421a in Usher syndrome, a rare blindness disorder.</p>
<h2><strong>AstraZeneca silences its COVID-19 vaccine doubters</strong></h2>
<p>If the previous pivotal studies of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (AZD1222) were confusing, the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strong-data-clear-path-for-new-covid-19-vaccine-in-usa"">results from its US Phase III trial</a> are clear: the vaccine works and does not increase the risk of blood clots, noted Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>AZD1222 showed efficacy of 79% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, rising to 100% against severe disease and hospitalisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AstraZeneca plans to file AZD1222 in the US in the first half of April, its head of biopharmaceuticals, Ruud Dobber, said on a media call Monday. An emergency use authorization looks like a foregone conclusion given that Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s one-shot version of JNJ-78436735 got the go-ahead on apparently weaker data, although the usual caveats about cross-trial comparisons apply.</p>
<p>There will also be pressure on the agency to push AZD1222 through quickly as the USA has pre-ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca jab, on a par with the contribution from Pfizer and Moderna. If and when AstraZeneca&rsquo;s shot gets the green light, the company is ready to deliver 30 million doses immediately, with another 20 million to follow later the same month, Mr Dobber said.</p>
<p>The biggest unanswered question, though, concerns AZD1222&rsquo;s efficacy against emerging variants. AstraZeneca had no data to share here today, but the trial is sequencing confirmed Covid-19 cases to determine which variant is responsible, with data to be reported &ldquo;in due course,&rdquo; a spokesperson told <em>Evaluate Vantage</em>.</p>
<p>The real significance of the results may lie beyond the USA, according to Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University&rsquo;s School of Public Health, quoted by EndPoints News.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have a fourth vaccine here in the US, but by the time this is authorized, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna be looking for a lot more vaccines here. We&rsquo;ll have plenty. But it may add to our stockpiles,&rdquo; he said on the Today show. &ldquo;I think the bigger issue is global. This vaccine &mdash; there are hundreds of millions of doses of this being made around the world, and we really need to vaccinate the world. Remember, this is a global pandemic, and it will come to an end when the world is vaccinated. This is our best ticket toward vaccinating the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Much ado about nothing</strong></p>
<p>Later in the week, AstraZeneca released an <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/more-positive-data-clarify-picture-on-astrazeneca-jab"">updated analysis of the data</a>, on which Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Jacob Plieth commented, noting that the storm over a US pivotal trial of the Covid-19 vaccine AZN1222 could be fizzling out. AstraZeneca said the study&rsquo;s final primary analysis yielded vaccine efficacy of 76% &ndash; only slightly below Monday&rsquo;s disputed 79% interim figure.</p>
<p>If 76% efficacy is accurate the obvious question is what would have moved the NIAID to start its extraordinary row with the company. The spotlight is on AstraZeneca&rsquo;s revelation of an extra 14 possible Covid-19 cases in the trial that have yet to be adjudicated. However, even if all occurred on AZN1222 &ndash; a highly unlikely worst-case scenario &ndash; the numbers do not change hugely, <em>Evaluate Vantage </em>calculates.</p>
<p>Certainly, the pressure is now on the NIAID to spell out its case to avoid further undermining confidence in the vaccine. That confidence has been shaken in no small part by Astra&rsquo;s own evasiveness and lack of clarity at several points in AZN1222&rsquo;s development.</p>
<h2><strong>REGN-COV2 looks better and better, giving insurance against vaccine failure</strong></h2>
<p>Last Tuesday Regeneron and Roche announced positive <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roche-cocktail-stops-coronavirus-and-key-variants"">top-line results from their REGN-COV2</a> Phase III trial (n=4,567) in high-risk non-hospitalized patient setting, commented SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges. The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% and 71% with 1200mg and 2400mg, respectively, versus placebo. We believe the conclusive results that show REGN-COV2, even at the lower dose, can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in the outpatient setting is important since it could increase both utilization and supply.</p>
<p>The positive results also move the company one step closer to prophylaxis for high risk or exposed individuals, which is likely to be even more useful in responding to the endemic or pandemic cases of COVID. The confirmation that the lower 1,200mg dose has comparable efficacy to 2400mg is also meaningful for supply. In the government purchase agreement in January, REGN expects to supply 750,000 finished doses by the end of June based on the 2400mg dose; this could expand to 1.25 million doses when the 1,200mg dose is authorized and could double the expected revenue (the contract was per dose, not per mg). Mr Porges also believes that REGN-COV2 is well positioned to play a complementary role to vaccines as it appears to be the most effective antibody against emerging immuno-resistant variants.</p>
<p>Regeneron clarified that it expects revenue from REGN-CoV2 of approximately $321 million in the first quarter of this year, which is the remainder of the $466 million initial government contract, and now expect most of the revenue from the sale of 1.2 million doses of the 1,200mg dose in the second quarter, presumably at the same government contracted price of $2100/dose. This suggests that revenue in the second quarter could be as high as $2.6 billion, which compares to our estimate of $1.5 billion and consensus of $1.3 billion. Depending on the trajectory of the pandemic, further revenue could accrue in third and fourth quarter this year and will almost certainly be generated by international markets where vaccine uptake has been slower and case loads are therefore likely to be higher for longer.</p>
<h2><strong>FDA panel slaps down Pfizer&rsquo;s storied osteoarthritis drug</strong></h2>
<p>On Thursday, the FDA&rsquo;s joint meeting of the Arthritis and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (AdCom) <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-joint-adcom-returns-negative-vote-on-tanezumab-for-osteo-pain"">issued a resounding rejection</a> (19 &ldquo;No&rdquo;, 1 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;) of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for Pfizer/Eli Lilly&rsquo;s NGF antibody, tanezumab, for the treatment of osteoarthritis, noted SVB Leerink&rsquo;s Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>While the AdCom did not vote for or against approval, this resounding vote and the FDA&rsquo;s comments and briefing document suggest that the members and reviewers see the benefit from the drug as modest and the risk as significant. In this context, we believe it is sensible to push out the timing for the approval and launch of tanezumab by two years (to 2023) and to reduce its probability to 35% (from 65% previously). Leerink has made similar changes to its timing and probability estimate for Regeneron&rsquo;s fasinumab (partnered with Teva), but its Regeneron forecast is adjusted to account for increased sales of their COVID antibody medicine, REGN-COV2, which now seems likely to generate greater revenue, from its lower dose and better competitive position, than we had previously forecast. These changes reduce Mr Porges&rsquo; price target for Pfizer by $1 to $39 and increase his price target for Regeneron by $2 to $657.</p>
<p>At the very least, Pfizer and its partner Lilly will need to demonstrate longer-term safety, and propose a more practical REMS solution, to secure approval, which he expects to take at least another two years. The voting outcome is a disappointment for Pfizer and Lilly and a general blow to other nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors in development (Regeneron/Teva&rsquo;s fasinumab), but he believes investor expectations are already modest for tanezumab with consensus peak sales of $520 million in 2030 (Leerink&rsquo;s current estimate is $268 million).</p>
<p>Adding his voice, EndPoints News&rsquo; Zachary Brennan notes that outside experts advising the FDA voted 19 to 1 against Pfizer&rsquo;s potential osteoarthritis drug tanezumab, saying the proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) will not ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. One of the two consumer reps voted yes. He cites examples of the panalists&rsquo; comments.</p>
<p>Edward Cheng, professor of reconstructive surgery at the University of Minnesota, said tanezumab &ldquo;does not fill&rdquo; the unmet need for an effective drug for osteoarthritis and chronic arthritis pain, explaining that it&rsquo;s no better than aspirin or ibuprofen, or even placebo.</p>
<p>Panelist Lewis Nelson, chief of the division of medical toxicology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said: &ldquo;I have serious concerns with the proposed REMS being effective&hellip;We don&rsquo;t know what happens behind closed doors, and even iron-clad REMS with strict guardrails have failed. And this one is a little bit looser than those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasvinder Singh, committee member and professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, called for a longer-term study with much larger samples, and there would have to be additional insights with regards to the understanding of the pathophysiology and biology of what leads to this rapidly progressing osteoarthritis, which the REMS is meant to help mitigate.</p>
<h2><strong>ProQR hopes to &lsquo;usherin&rsquo; a new ophthalmic therapy</strong></h2>
<p>Mixed mid-stage data on <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rna-therapy-shows-positive-trial-results-for-rare-blindness-disorders"">ProQR&rsquo;s exon skipper QR-421a</a> in the rare ophthalmic disorder Usher syndrome were released early on Wednesday morning to widespread apathy. The day after, however, the company&rsquo;s stock shot up 61%. It is not clear why this reaction was delayed, commented Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Elizabeth Cairns.</p>
<p>Neither is it clear that it was justified. The Phase I/II Stellar trial data are apparently enough for ProQR to push ahead with pivotal studies, but they are not wildly positive, and the number of patients is small. There is one thing in the company&rsquo;s favor, however: should Phase III show a more definite benefit, ProQR looks likely to have the Usher&rsquo;s market to itself for some time, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Evercore ISI analysts, a three-line gain on the standard chart used for BCVA is considered clinically meaningful by the FDA. Since there are five letters in each line on the chart, Stellar appears to have missed this threshold. It is close to meeting the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s requirement for meaningfulness, however, at least in the advanced patient cohort: the EU agency has set this at a gain of two lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other project in active clinical development specifically for Usher syndrome &ndash; excluding lapsed trials, natural history studies and academic work &ndash; appears to be a form of N-acetylcysteine amide under investigation by the Texan group Nacuity Pharmaceuticals. The Slo-RP trial compares an oral therapy, NPI-001, versus placebo in 48 patients with retinitis pigmentosa associated with Usher syndrome.</p>","2021-03-28 13:37:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 26, 2021","News review, AstraZeneca, AZD1222, US trial, Roche, Regeneron, REGN-COV2, COVID-19, Cocktail, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Tanezumab, Osteoarthritis, ProQR, QR-421a.","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 26, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-28 13:33:56","2021-03-28 13:52:17",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-26-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Infectious diseases, Ophthalmics, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche","AZD1222, COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, QR-421a, REGN-COV2, tanezumab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The FDA EUA submission is based on an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase III COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which evaluated VIR-7831 as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization.</p>
<p>Results of the interim analysis, based on data from 583 patients enrolled in the trial, demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalization or death in those receiving VIR-7831 compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. As a result, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped for enrollment due to evidence of profound efficacy.

<p>The approval is based on efficacy and safety from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 trial in patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and the TRANSCEND WORLD trial in patients with R/R aggressive B-cell NHL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large B-cell lymphoma comprises several disease types including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Japan, accounting for 30%-40% of all B-cell cases diagnosed, and is especially prevalent among people in their 60&rsquo;s. There is currently no established standard-of-care treatment for patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma, which underscores the need for new treatments for in this disease area. Follicular lymphoma accounts for 10%-20% of all B-cell NHL cases in Japan. Patients initially respond to chemotherapy, but relapse is common, especially in advanced-stage patients. There is also no established standard-of-care treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma grade 3B.</p>
<h2><strong>Pricing still to be agreed</strong></h2>
<p>The company has not said how much the drug will cost in Japan, where prices are negotiated with the government and, only after that has been agreed, can a drug be launched. However, in the USA, Bristol Myers set a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-breyanzi-new-treatment-for-b-cell-lymphoma"">list price of $410,300 for Breyanzi</a>, about 10% more than the $373,000 price set by both Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Novartis (NOVN: VX) Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) when they launched their respective treatments in the USA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yescarta was approved in Japan in January this year. Kymriah on May 22, 2019 was cleared for listing with a National Health Insurance (NHI) with a price tag of some 33.5 million yen ($305,800).</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe Barland, president and chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb KK and Celgene KK, said: ""I am pleased that we have received regulatory approval in Japan for Breyanzi, our first CAR-T cell therapy, which will allow us to provide a new treatment option for patients fighting relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. In addition, we are filing an application for a further CAR-T cell therapy to address more unmet medical needs. As a game-changer committed to 'innovation with heart', Bristol Myers Squibb will continue on its journey to help patients prevail over serious diseases.""</p>
<p>Breyanzi was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 5, 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B.</p>

<h2><strong>New manufacturing site for AstraZeneca&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>
<p>A new manufacturing site has been approved for the production of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca active substance. The Halix site is located in Leiden, the Netherlands, and will bring the total number of manufacturing sites licensed for the production of the active substance of the vaccine to four.</p>
<h2><strong>New site and more flexible storage conditions for BioNTech/Pfizer&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>
<p>A new site has also been approved for the production of Comirnaty, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The facility, which is in the German city of Marburg, will produce both active substance and the finished product. There are currently three active substance manufacturing sites supplying the EU included in the marketing authorization.</p>
<p>In addition to the new manufacturing facility for this vaccine, the CHMP has also given a positive opinion to allow transportation and storage of vials of this vaccine at temperatures between -25 to -15˚C (ie, the temperature of standard pharmaceutical freezers) for a one-off period of two weeks. This is an alternative to the long-term storage of the vials at a temperature between -90 to -60˚C in special freezers. It is expected to facilitate the rapid roll-out and distribution of the vaccine in the EU by reducing the need for ultra-low temperature cold storage conditions throughout the supply chain.</p>
<h2><strong>New manufacturing site and scaled-up for Moderna&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>
<p>Already last week, the CHMP recommended approving the addition of a new manufacturing site for the production of active substance and finished product intermediates for Moderna&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine. The addition of the new manufacturing lines at the Lonza facility, located in Visp, Switzerland, together with other changes to the manufacturing processes that were greenlighted by the Committee are intended to scale-up production capacity and increase supply of the vaccine for the EU market.</p>
<p>The changes described will be included in the publicly available information on these vaccines on EMA&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>The EMA is in continuous dialogue with the marketing authorization holders of COVID-19 vaccines as they seek to expand their production capacity for the supply of vaccines in the EU. As for any medicine in the EU, COVID-19 vaccines can only be manufactured in approved sites that are included in the marketing authorization following regulatory assessment.</p>

<p>There was a single voting question focused on whether the proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for tanezumab will ensure its benefits outweigh its risks, and the Committee voted 1 in favor and 19 against, the companies noted.</p>
<p>Tanezumab 2.5mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every eight weeks is being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) pain in adult patients for whom use of other analgesics is ineffective or not appropriate. Tanezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody in a new class of medicines called nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors, which work in a different manner than currently available treatments such as opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other analgesics. In studies to date, tanezumab has not demonstrated a risk of addiction, misuse or dependence.</p>
<p>Tanezumab has been under development for more than a decade and dogged by safety issues. The anti-nerve growth factor&rsquo;s past has been blighted by incidences of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis that led to a partial clinical hold.</p>
<h2><strong>Will continue to work with FDA</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;While we are disappointed with today&rsquo;s outcome, we continue to believe that tanezumab has a positive benefit-risk profile for patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain for whom current treatments are ineffective or not appropriate. Many of these patients have exhausted available therapies, have not had a new class of medications available to them in more than a decade and are eager for new, non-opioid options,&rdquo; said Ken Verburg, tanezumab development team leader, Pfizer global product development. &ldquo;We will continue to work with the FDA as the agency continues its review of our application.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee&rsquo;s discussions were based on the Biologics License Application (BLA) currently under review by the FDA. The BLA includes data from 20 Phase I-III clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of tanezumab administered intravenously or SC in patients with OA, including three pivotal Phase III SC studies involving more than 4,500 patients with moderate-to-severe OA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dialogue during the open public forum of this week&rsquo;s Advisory Committee meeting reinforced the urgent need for innovation for people living with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain &ndash; many of whom cycle through three to four therapies each year without adequate relief.

<p>US biotech major Gilead Sciences&rsquo; (Nasdaq: GILD) MAA is now under accelerated review by the EMA, in recognition of the product being considered of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation</p>
<p>SG is a first-in-class therapy targeting Trop-2, a protein frequently expressed in multiple types of epithelial tumors, such as TNBC, where high expression is associated with poor survival and relapse. Currently, in the European Union, there is no authorized standard treatment regimen with proven benefit in overall survival (OS) for patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC.</p>
<h2><strong>Blockbuster potential</strong></h2>
<p>Gilead gained rights to Trodelvy through its $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics in September last year, as part of its bid to expand in oncology. At that time, Cowan analyst Phil Nadeau said Trodelvy is expected to have $4 billion in peak sales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive and life-threatening cancer. Unfortunately, for many people with this cancer, there are not enough effective treatment options and their prognosis is extremely poor,&rdquo; said Dr Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer,&nbsp;Gilead Sciences. &ldquo;The validation of our EU marketing application is an important step toward addressing the significant unmet medical need for people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>Immunomedics won accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for Trodelvy in April 2020, to treat adult patients with metastatic TNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.

488157,,"Europe’s pharma has the innovations, but now to deliver for patients?","Medicines to treat infectious diseases and inflammatory disorder, as well as cancers, Alzheimer’s and rare diseases that collectively affect millions of people are under development by pharma and biotech, but the problem now is to deliver them to patients.","<p>Medicines to treat infectious diseases and inflammatory disorder, as well as cancers, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and rare diseases that collectively affect millions of people are under development by pharma and biotech, but the problem now is to deliver them to patients.</p>
<p>This is the question posed by a new study released today by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).</p>
<p>The new EFPIA Pipeline Review reveals that these disease areas are among the top priorities of researchers running clinical trials today to investigate new medicines and vaccines. The comprehensive report found that in 2020 alone, around 5,000 clinical trials were launched &ndash; despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the volume of trials has increased over the past five years.</p>
<p>The Review paints a picture of a healthy innovative pipeline, focused on major unmet needs: 40% of trials are on substances targeting rare diseases, while ground-breaking cell and gene therapies continue to grow in importance, notes EFPIA director general Nathalie Moll.</p>
<p>The example of gene therapies is particularly inspiring. By replacing defective or missing genes, scientists aim to cure life-long and highly debilitating diseases such as haemophilia. CAR-T treatments, a type of cell therapy which are already transforming the lives of people with blood cancers, are now being studied also against solid tumors. This could be a future game-changer for many forms of cancer.</p>
<p>The report also points to progress on Alzheimer&rsquo;s treatments which researchers hope will delay the onset and progression of dementia; remyelinating therapies with the potential to restore mobility and vision in people with multiple sclerosis; and curative therapies for HIV and hepatitis B. And let&rsquo;s not forget breakthrough mRNA technologies which have given us the first COVID-19 vaccines and could one day be used to treat aggressive brain cancer, said Ms Moll.</p>
<h2><strong>Preparing for the future</strong></h2>
<p>The Pipeline Review surely inspires optimism about the overall trajectory of medical innovation and comes with a caveat. Our capacity to continue to develop and deploy the results of these research efforts requires fresh thinking about Europe&rsquo;s research ecosystem and healthcare infrastructure. Many times, however, clinical trials which are both vital for the research eco-system as well as the first chance for many patients to get access to ground-breaking therapies, do not take place in Europe, but in the USA, China and other regions. While it is clear that past innovations have improved patient outcomes, and the coming wave of advances can go much further, now is the moment for preparation as well as celebration.</p>
<p>The report identifies areas where industry can work with other stakeholders to pave the way for the new therapies and vaccines that the pipeline can deliver. It is a recipe for making Europe a global leader in medical innovation while ensuring that our patients have access to interventions that could improve &ndash; or save &ndash; their lives.</p>
<p>For a start, we need to adapt our regulatory processes to better suit the kinds of therapies coming down the track. The clinical development and production of the new advanced therapies on the horizon require new approval pathways.</p>
<p>Equally, today&rsquo;s approaches to Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and pricing and payment may be ill-suited to tomorrow&rsquo;s therapies. New approaches to funding truly innovative treatments will be essential to their use, as well as robust systems for data capture to monitor the effectiveness of new treatments in real life.</p>

<p>The approval is for CF patients aged 12 years and older who have at least on F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, the most common CF-causing mutation worldwide. Up to 90% of people living with CF worldwide have at least one F508del mutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted the TGA has approved Trikafta for eligible people living with CF in Australia and will continue working with the Australian government to bring this important medicine to patients as quickly as possible,&rdquo; said Dr Reshma Kewalramani, chief executive and president of Vertex. &ldquo;It is our goal to develop and provide treatments for all people with CF around the world, and today is another significant milestone on that journey,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>CF affects approximately 3,500 people in Australia. It is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene.</p>
<p>Trikafta is already by far the best-selling drug for Vertex, generating revenues of $3.86 billion for full-year 2020.</p>
<h2><strong>Trikafta targets underlying cause of the disease</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Cystic fibrosis is a complex, progressive, devastating disease that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. It is a condition that significantly affects not only the patient, but also those who care for them, with people living with cystic fibrosis spending multiple hours every day on treatment and requiring daily care from a family member or loved one,&rdquo; said Professor John Wilson AM, head of Cystic Fibrosis Service, Alfred Health. &ldquo;The approval of any new treatment option for people living with cystic fibrosis is always welcome news. This new treatment is for patients ages 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation and means more patients can potentially benefit from a medicine that targets the underlying cause of the disease, for the first time.&rdquo;</p>

488152,,"ABPI calls for ambitious UK cancer strategy","The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) wants the UK government to make improving cancer outcomes a priority funding focus.","<p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) wants the UK government to make improving cancer outcomes a priority funding focus.</p>
<p>An ABPI report says that the UK must be more ambitious with its cancer strategy if it is to compete with the leading nations across Europe &ndash; from improving early diagnosis, reducing variations in care to using of the latest medicines and treatments.</p>
<p>While cancer incidence has been rising in the UK, deaths have been declining and survival rates increasing pre-pandemic.</p>
<h2>Level up with comparative countries</h2>
<p>However, COVID-19 is widely thought to have significantly impacted every aspect of cancer care &ndash; from diagnosis and patients' willingness to present for treatment through to service delivery and follow-up care.</p>
<p>The report &ndash; Cancer in 2020 and beyond: Cross-sector insights into improving outcomes for cancer patients &ndash; is based on interviews with 14 high-profile UK cancer stakeholders from across the National Health Service (NHS), academia, industry, and patient-facing charities.</p>
<p>It makes a number of recommendations which, if implemented, the contributors say, would lead to meaningful improvements for NHS cancer patients far beyond pandemic recovery.</p>
<p>The first recommendation is that the Department of Health and Social Care should set ambitious timelines with appropriate funding to deliver care on a par with other European and G7 countries and work with the cancer community on a strategy to deliver this goal.</p>
<p>Other recommendations are to improve early diagnosis and treatment, reduce variation in care and speed up adoption and innovation.</p>
<h2>Better research than development</h2>
<p>Paul Catchpole, director of value and access policy at the ABPI, said: &ldquo;There seems to be overwhelming agreement from those working in cancer services that we need to look at how to improve patient pathways and bring these more in line with other countries. As we look to cautiously and safely restart services that were restricted due to COVID-19, there is an opportunity to now do things differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take the combined effort of every person in the cancer community working together to deliver high-quality, consistent care to NHS patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the charity Breast Cancer Now, said: &ldquo;When it comes to research and development, we&rsquo;re good at the &lsquo;R&rsquo; but not at the &lsquo;D&rsquo; in the UK and a large part of the reason for that is due to workforce and funding restraints. The government needs to have ambition to improve cancer outcomes through the implementation of research innovations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shared concern among interviewees was the greater need for investment in the health service if the UK is to achieve better quality care for people with cancer. In 2018, the UK spent &pound;159 ($218) per person per year on cancer care, which is below the European average of &pound;176 and considerably less than countries of comparable size and wealth such as Germany and France.</p>","2021-03-25 12:46:00",,"cancer, care, ABPI, improving, outcomes, funding, ambitious, strategy, industry, patients, government, countries, diagnosis, calls, priority, Pharmaceutica","The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) wants the UK government to make improving cancer outcomes a priority funding focus.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-25 12:37:56","2021-03-25 13:56:36",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abpi-calls-for-ambitious-uk-cancer-strategy,,,,,,uk_london-1-.jpg,uk_london_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Cancer,Pharmaceutical,Oncology,"Government Affairs, Health Medical Pharma",UK,ABPI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>After cohort 1 of the study provided the clinical proof of concept for derazantinib monotherapy in the treatment of iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene fusions, cohort 2 is enrolling iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene mutations or amplifications. The efficacy data obtained in the interim analysis met the pre-specified threshold so that the study will proceed to the next stage as planned.</p>
<p>The interim analysis of cohort 2 is based on 14 evaluable patients who had at least one post-baseline tumor assessment. The pre-specified criterion that at least eight patients met the primary endpoint of obtaining progression-free survival (PFS) of at least three months was successfully achieved. The positive interim analysis allows the study to advance to its next stage and enrol a total of 43 patients. As a number of patients are still ongoing with treatment the median PFS was not yet mature at the time of the interim analysis and will be defined at a later time point.</p>
<h2><strong>Candidate in-licensed from ArQule</strong></h2>
<p>Basilea acquired <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/basilea-buys-rights-to-cancer-candidate-from-arqule"">rights to derazantinib</a> in 2018 from US biotech firm ArQule (Nasdaq: ARQL for an upfront payment of $10 million and up to $326 million in regulatory and commercial milestones).</p>
<p>The disease control rate (DCR), reflecting the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease, was 79%, including one patient with a confirmed complete response, one patient with an unconfirmed partial response and nine patients with a best response of stable disease at the time when the interim analysis was conducted.</p>
<p>According to analysts at goetzpartners securities, although still not fully mature, this data continues to support the case for the development of derazantinib in iCCA and in other fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) driven solid tumor indications such as urothelial carcinoma (UC) and gastric cancer where Basilea is currently investigating derazantinib as both a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Marc Engelhardt, Chief Medical Officer, said: &ldquo;We are very pleased with the positive interim results for this cohort of iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene mutations or amplifications. The clinical benefit with derazantinib is similar to that reported for iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene fusions earlier this year. This supports the relevance of derazantinib in a group of patients with iCCA where there has been very limited clinical evidence of successful treatment with other FGFR inhibitors and confirms the broad potential of derazantinib as a monotherapy for the treatment of iCCA patients with diverse FGFR2 genetic aberrations. This outcome is very encouraging and further strengthens the evidence for the differentiation of derazantinib versus other FGFR inhibitors both from the efficacy and safety perspective. We are now progressing the study to the next stage and expect top-line results for cohort 2 in the first half of 2022.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-25 12:20:00","Basilea provides more evidence of derazantinib's potential in iCCA","Basilea Pharmaceutica, Derazantinib, Phase II, iCCA, Cholangiocarcinoma, Cancer, Bile duct, ArQule","Basilea provides more evidence of derazantinib's potential in iCCA",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-25 12:20:02","2021-03-25 12:27:39",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/basilea-provides-more-evidence-of-derazantinib-s-potential-in-icca,,,,,,basilea_large.png,basilea_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Drug Trial, Research",Switzerland,"ArQule, Basilea Pharmaceutica",derazantinib,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The UK and EU said they have been &ldquo;discussing what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In February, with the vaccine rollout proceeding slowly in Europe, officials threatened to block exports from the 27-nation trading bloc, raising concerns over so-called &ldquo;vaccine nationalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), whose coronavirus jab is at the center of the dispute, said that it was fulfilling all contractual obligations, and was supplying the UK based on an earlier agreement which gave the country priority.</p>
<p>The EU, which ordered supplies of the product much later in 2020, wants to tap into the UK supply chain to speed up the pace of its vaccination program.</p>
<h2>High-level discussion</h2>
<p>Set against a background of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union and the often fractious negotiations over trade which have ensued, Anglo-European relations have been made worse by vaccine tensions.</p>
<p>European officials have been under pressure from individual nations, which have criticised the relatively scarce availability of vaccines.</p>
<p>To date, the EU has delivered enough vaccines to cover 6.9% of its population, while the UK has covered 23.3% of its population.</p>
<p>British lawmakers note that the UK reached a supply agreement with AstraZeneca months before the EU, funding development of the vaccine in return for early and exclusive access to supplies.</p>

488149,,"Manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan for Joyclu","Japanese firms Ono Pharmaceutical and Seikagaku Corp have announced that Seikagaku has obtained manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for Joyclu (diclofenac etalhyaluronate sodium; ONO-5704/SI-613) 30mg Intra-articular Injection for the indication of osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint).","<p>Japanese firms Ono Pharmaceutical (TYO: 4528) and Seikagaku Corp (TYO: 4548) have announced that Seikagaku has obtained manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for Joyclu (diclofenac etalhyaluronate sodium; ONO-5704/SI-613) 30mg Intra-articular Injection for the indication of osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint).</p>
<p>The approval is based on the results of three Phase III clinical studies conducted with ONO-5704/SI-613 in Japan. In the confirmatory study in patients with knee osteoarthritis, ONO-5704/SI-613 group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in WOMAC pain scores (a knee pain evaluation index, 100 mm VAS scale) over 12 weeks after the initial injection (three injections every four weeks), the primary endpoint of the study, compared to an inactive placebo group. Further, the safety profile of ONO-5704/SI-613 has shown no clinically-significant concerns in the study.</p>
<p>Joyclu is a formulation in which hyaluronic acid and diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory drug) are chemically bound using Seikagaku&rsquo;s own proprietary technology. It is designed to release diclofenac by hydrolysis in the joint. Further, since Joyclu is administered directly into the joint cavity as an injectable treatment, systemic exposure to diclofenac is low, and the risk of systemic adverse drug reaction is thought to be low. Joyclu is the first joint function improvement agent in Japan indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip joint.</p>
<p>IN 2017, Ono and Seikagaku entered the co-development and marketing collaboration on the osteoarthritis candidate in Japan, which could be worth 12 billion yen ($110 million [then exchange rates]). The companies aim to contribute to improvement of quality of life (QOL) in patients by providing a new treatment option for osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint).</p>
<p>Seikagaku will manufacture and market Joyclu, and Ono will be responsible for distribution. The companies say they will announce the launch date of Joyclu following the National Health Insurance drug price listing. There is no change in the forecast of consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 for either Ono or Seikagaku in connection with this matter.</p>

<h2>Italian stockpiling allegations</h2>
<p>Meantime, the European Commission has called on AstraZeneca to explain the origin and intended destination of a stockpile identified by Italian authorities at the Anagni finishing plant.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Swedish pharma major responded, aiming to clarify a number of inaccurate statements relating to COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (AZD1222) at that manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>There are no exports currently planned other than to COVAX countries, it stated. There are 13 million doses of vaccine waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to COVAX as part of the company&rsquo;s commitment to supply millions of doses to low-income countries. The vaccine was made outside the European Union (EU) and brought to the Anagni plant to be filled into vials. The EU fully supports supplying low-and middle-income countries through the COVAX facility, AstraZeneca pointed out.</p>
<p>There are another 16 million doses waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Europe. Approximately 10 million doses will be delivered to EU countries during the last week of March, and the balance to be delivered in April as the doses are approved for release after quality control.</p>
<p>It is incorrect to describe this as a stockpile, AstraZeneca stressed. The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed.</p>","2021-03-25 10:27:00","India delays exports of AstraZeneca shot; Italian situation explained","AstraZeneca, COVID-19, Vaccine, Exports, Hold, Indiam government, Serum Institute of India, Stockpiling, Italy, AZD1222","India delays exports of AstraZeneca shot; Italian situation explained",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-25 10:26:13","2021-03-25 10:35:30",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-delays-exports-of-astrazeneca-shot-italian-situation-explained,,,,,,covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_large.png,covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Production","Europe, India, Italy, UK","AstraZeneca, Serum Institute of India","AZD1222, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The termination follows the receipt of a letter containing allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct towards an employee of GSK by Dr Slaoui, which occurred several years ago when he was an employee of GSK. Upon receipt of the letter, the GSK board immediately initiated an investigation with an experienced law firm to investigate the allegations. The investigation of Dr Slaoui&rsquo;s conduct substantiated the allegations and is ongoing.</p>
<p>Dr Slaoui&rsquo;s behaviors are wholly unacceptable. They represent an abuse of his leadership position, violate company policies, and are contrary to the strong values that define GSK&rsquo;s culture, the UK pharma major stressed. The company expects everyone at GSK to behave in accordance with its values, especially its leaders where its standards are the highest. Sexual harassment and any abuse of leadership position are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Also, Dr Slaoui was swiftly fired from the chairman&rsquo;s role he held at Vaxcyte. And soon after that he also lost his role as CSO/advisor of Centessa, the big new startup out of Medicxi.</p>
<p>After retiring from GSK, where he was chairman of global vaccines, in March 2017, Dr Slaoui joined the board of US biotech firm Moderna (Nasdaq: RMNA), which has been at the forefront of COVID-19 treatment with the company&rsquo;s investigational mRNA vaccine candidate mRNA-1273. In May last year former US President Donald Trump appointed Dr Slaoui as chief scientist of Operation Warp Speed, the objective of which is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Christopher Corsico, senior vice president development at GSK and a current member of the Galvani board, has been appointed as the new chairman of Galvani. In addition, Amy Altshul, SVP Legal, R&amp;D and global commercial franchises at GSK, has also been appointed to the board.</p>
<p>Galvani Bioelectronics is a medical research company dedicated to the development of bioelectronic medicines to treat chronic diseases. Formed through a partnership between two global healthcare companies, GSK and Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences), a subsidiary of Alphabet in 2016, Galvani Bioelectronics combines life science knowledge with expertise in software and electronics for clinical applications.</p>","2021-03-24 18:07:00","GSK fires Moncef Slaoui from Galvani board","GlaxoSmithKline, Galvani, Moncef Slaoui, Fired, Chairmanship, Terminated, Sexual harassment","GSK fires Moncef Slaoui from Galvani board",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-24 18:07:02","2021-03-25 11:52:21",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gsk-fires-moncef-slaoui-from-galvani-board,,,,,,glaxosmithkline_gsk_large.jpg,glaxosmithkline_gsk_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Boardroom, Management",UK,"Galvani Bioelectronics, GlaxoSmithKline",,,,,,,,"Moncef Slaoui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488145,,"RNA therapy shows positive trial results for rare blindness disorders",,"<p>Dutch rare diseases biotech firm ProQR Therapeutics (Nasdaq: PRQR) saw its share rise as much as 11% in early trading today, after it announced encouraging results from a planned analysis of its Phase I/II Stellar trial of QR-421a in adults with Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (nsRP) due to&nbsp;USH2A&nbsp;exon 13 mutations.</p>
<p>In the trial, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal Phase II/III trials by year end 2021 &ndash; one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.</p>
<p>Early last year, the US Food and Drug Administration awarded a Rare Pediatric disease designation for QR-421a, designed to address the underlying cause of vision loss related to this type of genetic abnormality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the Stella trial, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the Phase II/III pivotal trials,&rdquo; said Dr Aniz Girach, chief medical officer of ProQR.</p>
<h2><strong>Plan to advance pivotal testing</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision. As expected, we saw benefits in both advanced and early-moderate patients in this slow progressing, debilitating eye disease, allowing us to advance this important investigational therapy for all patients with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to USH2A exon 13 mutations. Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal trials, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through clinical development,&rdquo; Dr Girach noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,&rdquo; said Dr Robert Koenekoop, a clinical-scientist from the Montreal Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surger, adding: &ldquo;Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to USH2A exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients&rsquo; biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal trial development.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

All of its businesses contributed positively to net sales and operating income.</p>
<p>Boehringer recorded net sales of 19.57 billion euros ($23.23 billion), a 3% increase compared to the previous year. Foreign currency headwinds had a considerable impact; adjusted for currency effects, net sales rose by 5.6% year on year.</p>
<p>Operating income at group level rose 22.2% to 4.62 billion euros. One-time gains from divestitures supported the operating income. Income after taxes saw a 12.5% year-on-year increase to 3.06 billion euros (2019: 2.72 billion euros).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boehringer says it stepped up its investments in R&amp;D significantly in 2020 in pursuit of innovative medicines and therapies for diseases for which no satisfactory treatments are available. In particular, efforts to research potential COVID-19 related therapies were accelerated. The company spent 3.7 billion euros on R&amp;D, 7% more than in the previous year. This represents the highest annual investment in R&amp;D in the 136-year history of the research-driven biopharmaceutical company.</p>
<h2><strong>Outlook for 2021</strong></h2>
<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a more challenging industry environment with increasing price pressure in several key markets is expected to have an impact on Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s results in 2021. Assuming that the approved vaccines and other medicines currently undergoing the approval process help curb the COVID-19 pandemic, the company expects strong general market growth for prescription pharmaceuticals. For 2021, Boehringer Ingelheim expects to achieve a slight year-on-year increase in net sales on a comparable basis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the results we achieved in 2020, considering the challenging conditions we faced,&rdquo; said Michael Schmelmer, the member of the board of managing directors responsible for Finance and Group Functions. &ldquo;We met our ambitious targets, both in terms of our contribution to the wellbeing of humans, pets and livestock, and our business performance. This allows us to continue to invest even more in R&amp;D, as well as in the long-term opportunities we have identified, most notably in the fields of oncology as well as digital and data technologies,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Human Pharma &ndash; Strong growth across all regions&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>At 14.42 billion euros, net sales of human pharmaceuticals grew strongly by 5.8% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects) and accounted for 74% of total net sales. All regions contributed to the strong results in Human Pharma. The USA remains the largest market for Boehringer Ingelheim with the highest regional net sales in the Human Pharma business, the company noted. The unit generated net sales of 5.66 billion euros in the USA, up 3.4% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects). In the EUCAN region (Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), net sales rose by 6.0% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects) to 4.59 billion euros. In Emerging Markets, including the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, Boehringer registered net sales of 2.84 billion euros, a 10.4% increase (year on year and adjusted for currency effects). In Japan, net sales increased by 6.2% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects) to 1.33 billion euros.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Top-four pharma product performances </strong></h2>
<p>Medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as well as respiratory diseases, remain the most important contributors to net sales.</p>
<p>Jardiance (empagliflozin), used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, remains the biggest revenue contributor in Human Pharma, generating net sales of 2.48 billion euros, up 15.3%. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ofev (nintedanib) was the company&rsquo;s second-strongest revenue contributor for the first time, with net sales of 2.06 billion euros and growth of 41% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects).

<p>In a criminal information previously filed in federal court in the District of Nevada, the United States charged FKOL with violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by failing to provide certain records to FDA investigators. As part of a criminal resolution with the Department of Justice, FKOL agreed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor offense.</p>
<p>US District Judge Jennifer Dorsey accepted the company&rsquo;s guilty plea and sentenced FKOL to pay a criminal fine of $30 million, forfeit an additional $20 million, and implement a compliance and ethics&nbsp;program designed to prevent, detect, and correct violations of US law relating to FKOL&rsquo;s manufacture of cancer drugs intended for terminally ill patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intelligence from the data and analytics provider shows that there have been some 340 licensing agreements since 2004 in head and neck cancer, amounting to an approximate total value of $35 billion.</p>
<p>Aarohi Rede, oncology analyst at GlobalData, said: &ldquo;The past few years have seen several licensing deals globally for clinical development in head and neck cancer. Merck KGaA&rsquo;s (MRK: DE) collaboration with Debiopharm has the potential to transform the current treatment paradigm for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by combining xevinapant, a new molecular entity, with Merck KGaA&rsquo;s strong commercialization capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the total licensing agreements signed, the highest recorded licensing agreements took place in North America, followed by Asia-Pacific, while the lowest recorded number of deals belonged to South and Central America. This is detailed in the table below.</p>
<p><img title=""unnamed-3.png"" src=""/media/project_tpl/image/unnamed-3.png"" alt=""unnamed-3.png"" width=""800"" height=""429"" /></p>
<p>Dr Rede added: &ldquo;Head and neck cancer is largely a chemotherapy-dominated market, but the past few years have seen effective use of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo (nivolumab) in the recurrent or metastatic settings. The current clinical development pipeline has around 20 late-stage agents in the immuno-modulating therapy or cell inhibitor classes, thus revealing a robust late-stage pipeline that is highly conducive to future partnerships for licensing and commercialization, and is expected to contribute to significant market growth over the next ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of these licensing deals involve strategic partnerships between Asia-Pacific, namely Chinese manufacturers, and US pharmaceuticals for joint clinical and commercial development of oncology assets, with the purpose of gaining market access in the USA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the currently marketed agents are patent protected, the introduction of drugs through these alliances poses competition for some of the premium-priced therapies, both from a market share and price perspective,&rdquo; Dr Rede said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While licensing agreements have been one of the key business development tactics in oncology, venture financing ($8.6 billion valuation), asset transactions ($4 billion valuation), and contract service agreements ($30 million valuation) are some of the other investment approaches considered in recent years to advance drug development science in the head and neck space by way of investment capitalism.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-24 12:20:00",,"head, neck, cancer, licensing, clinical, deal-making, late-stage, agreements, development, GlobalData, years, start, yielding, dividends, patients, market","A frenzy of deal-making activity in head and neck cancer is bringing late-stage clinical candidates into view, according to GlobalData.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-24 12:15:42","2021-03-24 12:46:26",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/deal-making-in-head-and-neck-cancer-to-start-yielding-dividends-for-patients,,,,,,medicines_money_stock_large.jpg,medicines_money_stock_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Head and neck cancer",Biotechnology,Oncology,"Deals, Licensing, Markets & Marketing",Global,"Bristol-Myers Squibb, Debiopharm, GlobalData, Merck & Co, Merck KGaA","Keytruda, Opdivo, xevinapant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In the STEP 4 trial, study participants who reached the maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.4mg during a 20-week run-in period were randomized to either continue treatment with semaglutide 2.4mg or switch to placebo for 48 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full results of the STEP 4 trial were presented Tuesday by Danish diabetes care giant Novo Nordisk (NOV: N) at the virtual Endocrine Society (ENDO) 2021 Annual Meeting and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>In December last year, Novo Nordisk filed for regulatory of the obesity indication in the USA and European Union for semaglutide, which, at a different oral dosage, is marketed as Rybelsus for diabetes and generated sales of 1,837 million kroner ($296 million) last year.</p>
<h2><strong>&lsquo;Obesity requires a long-term, individualized approach&rsquo;</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;For people with obesity, maintaining weight loss in the long term is challenging as both physiological and hormonal changes that occur following an initial weight loss can lead to weight regain. These changes, known as metabolic adaptation, result in lasting increased levels of hunger and desire to eat while reducing energy expenditure,&rdquo; said Dr Domenica Rubino, lead investigator of the STEP 4 trial and Director of Washington Center for Weight Management and Research. &ldquo;Like any other chronic disease, obesity requires a long-term, individualized approach to care, inclusive of medication and lifestyle components.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the 20-week run-in period, people who continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4mg for an additional 48 weeks continued to lose weight with a statistically -ignificant additional m<a id=""save"" class=""save"" title=""Save""></a>Saveean weight loss of 7.9% (8.8% for the trial product estimand) from week 20 to week 68. People who were switched to placebo following the 20-week run-in period regained 6.9% of their body weight from week 20 to 68 (6.5% for the trial product estimand. The estimated treatment difference [ETD] for the treatment policy estimand was -14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -16.0, -13.5; p&lt;0.0001).

<p>The Japanese approval is based on data including the results from a multicenter overseas Phase Ib/II clinical study (GO29365) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Polivy in combination with BR therapy compared to BR therapy alone, and a multicenter, single-arm Japanese phase II study (JO40762/P-DRIVE study) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in R/R DLBCL.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of Polivy and BR therapy (40 patients) compared with BR therapy alone (40 patients) was studied in the randomized phase II part of the GO29365 study in 80 patients with R/R DLBCL not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The primary endpoint of the complete response rate (CRR) at the time point of primary response assessment (PRA; six to eight weeks after last dose of Polivy) as evaluated by an independent assessment committee using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was 40% (16/40 patients; 95% CI: 24.9-56.7%) in the Polivy + BR therapy group, and 17.5% (7/40 patients; 95% CI: 7.3-32.8%) in the BR therapy group (data cut-off: April 30, 2018).</p>
<p>Adverse reactions occurred in 36 (92.3%) patients out of 39 patients who received Polivy. The most common adverse reactions were neutropenia 53.8% (21/39 patients), thrombocytopenia 41.0% (16/39 patients), diarrhea and anemia 33.3% (13/39 patients) each, fatigue and nausea 23.1% (9/39 patients) each, and pyrexia and peripheral neuropathy 20.5% (8/39 patients) each.</p>","2021-03-23 16:57:00","Chugai gains Japanese nod for Polivy as lymphoma therapy","Chugai Pharma, Polivy, Approval, MHLW, Lymphoma, B-cell, DLBCL, Roche","Chugai gains Japanese nod for Polivy as lymphoma therapy",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-23 16:56:59","2021-03-23 17:04:31",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chugai-gains-japanese-nod-for-polivy-as-lymphoma-therapy,,,,,,chugai_kamakura_large.jpg,chugai_kamakura_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Hematology, Oncology","Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation",Japan,"Chugai, Roche",Polivy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The decision was based on the results of a pre-planned review of the data from the Phase III study conducted by an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The iDMC made its recommendation based on the investigational therapy&rsquo;s potential benefit/risk profile for study participants.</p>
<h2><strong>Drug licensed from Ionis</strong></h2>
<p>Tominersen (RG6042) was originally developed by USA-based Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: IONS) and licensed to Roche for $45 million in 2017. It was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Association in 2018. Roche&rsquo;s shares were hardly changed by the news, but Ionis was down more than 18% at $45.25 by mid-morning trading.</p>
<p>No new or emerging safety signals were identified for tominersen in the review of the data from this study. Roche intends to continue following participants for safety and clinical outcomes, without the dosing of the investigational medicine or placebo. Once full data from the Phase III study are available and analyzed, Roche will share learnings and future plans with the HD community.<br /> <br /> Dosing will be paused in the open-label extension study (GEN-EXTEND) of tominersen while data are carefully analysed to inform next steps on this study.</p>

488116,,"Amazon: threat or opportunity for pharmaceuticals?","Debbie Bowen-Heaton, partner at Oliver Wight, provides an Expert View on how companies can prepare for the disruption Amazon's arrival in Europe's pharmaceutical space will bring.","<p><em>Debbie Bowen-Heaton, partner at Oliver Wight, provides an Expert View on&nbsp;how companies can prepare for the disruption Amazon's arrival in Europe's pharmaceutical space will bring.</em></p>
<p>Following its successful launch in the USA, Amazon applied for &lsquo;Amazon Pharmacy&rsquo; trademarks in the UK and European Union (EU) last year.</p>
<p>Together with Amazon&rsquo;s partnership with the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, to offer medical advice on its platform Alexa, this is systematic of the way in which Amazon is looking to disrupt and revolutionize the sector.</p>
<p>If its approach to other industries is any indication, Amazon will change the way consumers access pharmacy care and exert pressure on the 'vertical' supply chain, from the factory floor to the customer's door.</p>
<p>While this presents a huge risk to UK and EU pharmacies, whether it presents a threat or an opportunity for pharmaceutical manufacturers is up for debate. Companies need to ask themselves the question &ndash; do they embrace Amazon or not, and what will be the impact of either option?</p>
<h2>Better option for smaller manufacturers?</h2>
<p>The clients I am speaking to are rightly concerned about how much control they will have in any relationship with the disruptor. If you look at Amazon&rsquo;s behavior across other sectors, you will see a company that not only owns the customer relationship and therefore data, but is also not afraid of predatory pricing to acquire market share, applying access fees to sellers and dictating terms of business.</p>
<p>For some smaller manufacturers, even if they relinquish some control, the opportunity with Amazon could level up their playing field with an increased exposure to a huge customer base and greater access.</p>
<p>However, for larger players, Amazon is a more powerful and potentially less accommodating partner. Ultimately, Amazon would be in control. Certainly for over-the-counter and generic drugs, it will be Amazon that decides whether to stock a particular product and woe betide any manufacturer who can&rsquo;t keep up with demand or falls short of expected service levels. Amazon will not be forgiving.</p>
<p>In addition, manufacturers could end up commoditized by an algorithm driven e-commerce model which would force them to compete on price in reverse auctions. This will be felt particularly keenly if Amazon starts manufacturing its own brand of generic products through acquisitions in this sector. The whole market for competing non-Amazon products could be stripped away overnight in a move which would be in line with Amazon&rsquo;s previous actions in areas such as electronics and office supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What other channels are available?</h2>
<p>The right decision will also depend on the type of product. For example, for over-the-counter medicines (many of which are already sold on Amazon), this may be the right strategy (after all, if they don&rsquo;t, their competitors will). And yet, for larger companies with a strong market share, excellent supply chain logistics and with branded and specialist products that need a degree of customer service and specialist knowledge, it may not be.</p>
<p>It is also worth asking what other channels, if you do not embrace Amazon, are available to you. For example, is there an opportunity to collaborate more closely with the large pharmacy chains and explore potential partnerships to create a better online seamless service for patients and customer?</p>
<p>Companies that have withstood the Amazon threat in other industries, such as Music Magpie, are those that have turned to innovation alongside capitalizing on a more customer-centric model as a strategy, and the pharmaceutical sector is no exception.</p>
<p>For those companies that decide to embrace Amazon, there are three key pillars that need to be put in place to ensure your company is able to withstand the disruptor&rsquo;s arrival and subsequently emerging market power:</p>
<h2>Agility of supply chain</h2>
<p>This is the number one priority and companies must make sure that they can respond to the opportunities and demand that comes alongside any partnership with Amazon. Amazon is potentially the &lsquo;Gorilla&rsquo; in the supply chain as the company will reduce margins and put pressure on any system that isn&rsquo;t able to deliver according to customer demand. The challenge will be the ability to keep up with new demand without ramping up costs. Companies should invest now in getting full control of their supply chain to minimize potential crisis and drive improvement in performance and optimal cost. Then focus on how to ensure they have the agility to be able to respond to opportunities.</p>
<p>It is also worth looking at how this will work with Amazon&rsquo;s logistics which tend to be centralized and not country specific, potentially causing further pressure to a company&rsquo;s supply chain. Free movement of goods across Europe means that Amazon could potentially sell across Europe and will easily be able to buy a product from one country at a cheaper price and distribute to other countries at this reduced cost. Regulation prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from doing this but what is to stop Amazon? Companies need to predict this well in advance and decide on the best solution such as where savings can be made throughout the supply chain or on product costs ...</p>
<h2>Demand Planning Management</h2>
<p>If companies can predict demand they will be in a strong position to partner with Amazon. While pharmaceutical companies have been excellent at applying technology for developing and manufacturing drugs, demand planning is often manual and overseen by the logistics department. They may use IT systems to help but these are often legacy systems which lack sufficient data and interoperability between departments. This means information cannot be processed and used efficiently by health professionals. I have seen some senior management teams that are ambivalent about new technology as they don&rsquo;t yet see the urgency of ensuring their demand planning process is robust. This is something that needs to happen regardless of Amazon&rsquo;s entrance into the market place but becomes increasingly important for companies who wish to use Amazon Pharmacy as a distribution channel.</p>
<p>By having the best data, pharmaceutical companies will be able to predict Amazon&rsquo;s demand or utilize this information to sell more effectively through other channels. Companies will need to make sure that they have the tools in place, such as an integrated process, patient and customer insights, key leading analytics, modelling and foresight, to shift to a more consumer-centric model and one that understands demand. While this is not happening enough in this sector, I have seen other clients in sectors such as retail use a hybrid model of AI technology and insight teams to ensure they have excellent demand planning capabilities.</p>
<p>Anticipate how you will collaborate with Amazon &ndash; this will give you the competitive edge as ultimately Amazon owns the customer relationship but they are not yet experts in the pharmaceutical sector. Although Amazon is very protective of its own data it could potentially benefit from additional insight and knowledge from pharmaceutical experts. When I worked with Nestle, for example, they invested heavily in category teams which gave them relevant and important customer behavioural information which ultimately helped both Nestle and the end retailer.</p>
<p>This could be further explored with Amazon. Management teams should ensure that collaborative planning forecasting and replenishing plans are shared and this should be done at the highest level with the top teams or CEOs from each company in regular dialogue. A good example of this collaboration with Amazon is Pharmapack, e-retailer of pharma and persona; hygience products. Its CEO has been quoted as saying that &lsquo;a big part of our business is our partnerships with Amazon, Walmart and eBay. Those are our three big partnerships that we&rsquo;re really focused on.&rsquo;. The company is on track to a &pound;1 billion ($1.38 billion) turnover so it is clearly a strategy that is working.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s arrival into the pharmaceutical market place heralds the emergence of a new dawn.</p>
<p>Whether companies embrace it or not needs to be a strategic decision where the challenges and threats are continually reviewed. More resource, planning and onus on the commercial team will be needed as the whole industry will be forced to adopt a more customer-centric model.</p>","2021-03-23 13:39:00",,"Amazon, companies, pharmaceutical, demand, customer, supply, chain, Amazons, market, opportunity, partner, manufacturers, Europe, arrival, sector, threat","Debbie Bowen-Heaton's, partner at Oliver Wight, provides an Expert View on how companies can prepare for the disruption Amazon's arrival in Europe's pharmaceuti",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-23 09:21:58","2021-03-25 10:43:37",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amazon-threat-or-opportunity-for-pharmaceuticals,,,,,,amazon_big.jpg,amazon_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"All therapy areas","Digital Pharma, Expert View, Focus On, Health Medical Pharma, In Depth","Europe, UK","Amazon, Oliver wight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>One of such drugs is vero-vincristine, a drug, which is used to treat blood cancer in children and is produced by Veropharm, part of the USA&rsquo;s Abbott (NYSE: ABT). In recent months, the company has almost completely suspended its supplies to the domestic market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As some Russian media reported, citing the company, the main reason for interruption of supplies is the change in production technology.</p>
<p>In the meantime, representatives of the Russian Ministry of Health said there is currently no shortage of the drug in the local market due to the presence of its another analogue - vincristine-RONC, which is produced by the Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that most of local oncologists consider the drug inconvenient for treating children, since the form of release does not allow accurate dosage the drug, which leads to increase of toxicity of therapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the ways to solve the problem is the beginning of procurements of another generic from Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA).&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Teva set to supply vincristine-teva</strong></h2>
<p>In a letter the Israeli company has recently notified the resumption of supplies of vincristine-teva starting from April. The drug disappeared from the Russian market in 2019, as deliveries under state contracts for the company became impossible due to the &ldquo;extra third&rdquo; rule. Another reason for the suspension of supplies was the low maximum selling price for vincristine, fixed by the Ministry of Health back in 2010.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in addition to vincristine, there is a high possibility of a shortage of some other drugs used for the treatment of blood cancer in children. An example is Oncaspar (pegaspargase), which lost its Russian registration in 2019 due to the transfer of rights to it by the French drugmaker Servier. In 2020, after complaints from patients and doctors, 1,500 bottles of the drug were purchased. However, further purchases are in question.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Servier to register Oncospar</strong></h2>
<p>A spokesman of Servier told the Russian Kommersant business paper that it intends to register Oncaspar under the new EAEU regulations, specifying that in March 2020 it submitted the corresponding dossier to the Ministry of Health.</p>

488121,,"CohBar discoveries ""a shocker to scientists” says CEO","Californian aging specialist CohBar is using mitochondrial science to treat diseases, but chief executive Steven Engle doesn’t rule out offering a “cure for ageing” at some point.","<p>Californian aging specialist CohBar (Nasdaq: CWBR) is using mitochondrial science to treat diseases, but chief executive Steven Engle doesn&rsquo;t rule out offering a &ldquo;cure for aging&rdquo; at some point.</p>
<p>Asked whether the firm could find itself developing products for healthy people to take, with the specific purpose of extending healthy lifespan, he says: &ldquo;Yes, I think that's possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He points to the example of metformin, a commonly used compound for diabetics, which he says &ldquo;actually has positive effects on things like cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patients who take metformin and are diabetic have a dramatic reduction in their cancer rate, on the order of 30%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Engle explains: &ldquo;What you have to do is to think about how to define aging. For a lot of people, aging is defined as a sum of all these different problems.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Breakthrough science</h2>
<p>For now, the firm has a traditional disease-focused approach, targeting indications with the goal of preparing regulatory submissions, based around the science of mitochondria - small cells involved in the production of energy.</p>
<p>When there are problems linked to the body&rsquo;s mitochondria, serious diseases can result, making them an ideal although still not fully understood target for research.</p>
<p>CohBar was founded around some unique research discoveries, including the fact that there are peptide sequences in the mitochondria genome, which Mr Engle describes as &ldquo;a shocker to scientists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second was the fact that &ldquo;the peptides that are put out by these sequences regulate multiple organs and systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s scientists have published research showing the impact of these peptides from the mitochondria in areas of metabolism like diabetes, oncology and even longevity.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like if you discovered a whole new set of hormones that nobody knew existed - if somebody announced that tomorrow, people would go bonkers - I mean how could we not know this? That&rsquo;s the level of this discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What differentiates the firm&rsquo;s approach is that, while other companies are seeking to fix the mitochondria themselves, CohBar is the only firm taking these sequences and seeking to create drugs from them.</p>
<p>So far, the science has paved the way for an exciting pipeline with a huge amount of potential in multiple therapy areas.</p>
<h2>Pipeline development</h2>
<p>The company recently crowned CB5138-3 as its lead candidate for advancement into Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling activities.</p>
<p>The candidate is a CB5138 analog, a novel class of molecules derived from a natural, mitochondrially encoded peptide source, with potential for treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and other fibrotic diseases.</p>
<p>The company is targeting 2022 for clinical studies, building on positive pre-clinical data which show its potential as an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic for IPF, an unmet medical need with few treatment options.</p>
<p>Mr Engle says the firm is &ldquo;funded through to the first quarter of next year and before then we expect to get results out of our Phase Ib as well as a few of the other key milestones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company was able to raise funds last year and is &ldquo;building up the awareness on the investment side as we go,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>With an initial focus on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity, CohBar has a clinical strategy driven by both scientific and commercial considerations.</p>
<p>Analysts have forecast that there could be tens of billions of dollars in untapped revenues in treating NASH, an area of significant unmet medical need in which there are very few treatment options.</p>
<p>Asked about taking the pipeline forward, and whether CohBar has considered partnering with big pharma, he says: &ldquo;In my previous companies we've built portfolios with multiple products, and once you have multiple products then some them you keep and some of them you partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that's exactly what's going to happen with CohBar,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;A year ago people mostly saw us focused on NASH and obesity, but in the last year we made big strides in the other programs, bringing them forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s breakthrough science looks likely to open up a meaningful therapeutic approach which, in the end, could be the most effective way to extend healthy lifespan.</p>","2021-03-23 11:46:00",,"CohBar, ageing, diseases, Engle, mitochondria, mitochondrial, firm, people, treating, focused, discoveries, shocker, scientists”, multiple, point, Nasdaq","Californian ageing specialist CohBar (Nasdaq: CWBR) is focused on treating mitochondrial diseases, but chief executive Steven Engle doesn’t rule out offering a ",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-23 11:46:07","2021-03-23 17:16:52",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cohbar-discoveries-a-shocker-to-scientists-says-ceo,,,,,,cohbar_big.jpg,cohbar_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Nephrology and Hepatology, Oncology","CEO Interviews, Drug Trial, Focus On, In Depth, Interviews, Management, One to Watch Companies, Research",USA,CohBar,CB5138-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In accordance with the initiative, registration of drugs will be conducted on the basis of their pre-clinical studies (ie, animal tests) and a summary report of their safety and efficacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, temporary preferences for producers were introduced in 2020 and were primarily applied for drugs against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Scheme already used, as for Sputnik V approval</strong></h2>
<p>Such scheme has already been applied for registration of Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine as well as favipiravir, which is a drug, recommended in Russia for the treatment of the novel coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a single initiative, which was put forward by the state. As part of its plans is providing additional preferences for producers that develop a full-cycle production within the territory of Russia and other countries of the Eurasian Economic Union. Most of such producers will receive additional benefits during public procurements in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation of these plans is considered as very important by the Russian government as, according to press-service of the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, from the beginning of 2021, for a significant part of 215 drugs, which have the status of vital in Russia, there was a lack of production of active ingredients and finished dosage forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the so-called &ldquo;extra third&rdquo; rule, (which does not allow a foreign drug manufacturer to bid if at least two producers from the EAEU countries enter the auctions) already exists in Russia.</p>
<p>Some local analysts believe the latest state proposals will create additional obstacles for foreign pharmaceutical companies during state tenders in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, most Russian pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors also opposed the latest state initiatives as, according to them, there are only a few pharmaceutical companies in Russia that operate on a full cycle basis, and it is unclear why such preferences should be provided to them.</p>","2021-03-23 11:29:00","Russia to speed registration of new drugs; favoring domestic drugmaker","Registration, New drugs, Procedure, Speeding-up, Preferences, Domestic drugmakers","Russia to speed registration of new drugs; favoring domestic drugmakers",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-23 11:28:07","2021-03-23 11:34:21",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-to-speed-registration-of-new-drugs-favoring-domestic-drugmakers,,,,,,russia_li.jpg,russia_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"All therapy areas","Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Regulation",Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488115,,"Marriage of private equity and healthcare has a bright future, specialist investor says","There has never been a better time to raise money for companies in the life sciences sector, according to Ben Long, partner at UK-headquartered private equity firm Inflexion.","<p>There has never been a better time to raise money for companies in the life sciences sector, according to&nbsp;Ben&nbsp;Long (pictured), partner at UK-headquartered private equity firm Inflexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything with healthcare on it is going to receive a lot of demand from private equity, in particular, because there&rsquo;s a set pool of capital out there which needs to be invested and, for the last 12 months, really the only sectors where you&rsquo;ve been able to find certainty, or something close to certainty, have been healthcare and technology,&rdquo; Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;explained.</p>
<p>A rare positive from the pandemic is that it has provided a reminder of the societal value of healthcare, but Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said that the sector&rsquo;s attractiveness as an investment opportunity had already become evident for firms like his before COVID-19 came along.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""We look at businesses that are generating strong growth, have high margins and have really ambitious management teams""</span>At the moment, Inflexion is invested in five healthcare businesses out of a total portfolio of 52, and Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said that there was an appetite to do more in this space.</p>
<p>One deal that showed Inflexion&rsquo;s preparedness to make a substantial investment when the right opportunity comes along was last year&rsquo;s &pound;156 million ($217 million) acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, the UK's leading liquid pharmaceuticals business. The business was carved out from US-listed drugmaker Perrigo (NYSE: PRGO), which was seeking to focus on its over-the-counter operations.&nbsp;Inflexion has since invested a further &pound;15 million in business development and the facilities in Leeds.</p>
<p>Other healthcare companies in Inflexion&rsquo;s portfolio include Pharmaspectra, a provider of medical affairs data to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, and European LifeCare, which provides travel clinics and public vaccination programs and has had its hands full in recent months delivering parts of the COVID-19 vaccine in Denmark.</p>
<p>So what is it that Inflexion looks for when seeking healthcare companies to invest in?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take it case-by-case,&rdquo; Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said. &ldquo;We look at businesses that are generating strong growth, have high margins and have really ambitious management teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The areas we&rsquo;re interested in are niche pharma, pharma services such as companies supplying into the R&amp;D clinical journey and beyond like Pharmaspectra, medical devices, software into the life sciences industry &ndash; typically work-flow management tools &ndash; and animal health.""</p>
<p>Software in life sciences is the hottest area from a private equity perspective at the moment, Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will continue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The pandemic has forced the hands of quite a few stakeholders in the industry to adapt more to digital technologies. If you think about virtual trials and how the regulation has changed around that and how protocol has evolved to take that into account.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Adding value on top of investment</h2>
<p>Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;would not be surprised to see plenty of money flooding into the generics sector, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect many economies have had a bit of a wake-up call on the fact that they&rsquo;re under-investing in healthcare or, at least, the investment&nbsp;should be reallocated to different parts of the healthcare services that they&rsquo;re providing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean there&rsquo;s any more money to fund healthcare, so there will be some reallocations and I would have thought that the generics market will be a major beneficiary of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In what is a competitive market, private equity firms have to persuade companies that they can add value to the business when they become a shareholder.</p>
<p>Inflexion, for example, helps companies to expand technologically and geographically through its in-house digital teams and international offices, and employs former headhunters to build on the personnel front.</p>
<p>Also important to what Inflexion does are its sector experts within healthcare and a commercial specialist to advise on improving companies&rsquo; sales operations, and it helps firms to grow through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).</p>
<h2>'Huge opportunity'</h2>
<p>Examples of this input include, on the human resources side, Inflexion sourcing a chief financial officer for Rosemont to help structure the business for rapid growth, and supporting on the technology elements of the carve out. There may also be opportunities to drive digital marketing, including through improving its remote communications with healthcare practitioners.</p>
<p>Being able to make changes and wanting to grow rapidly is something that Inflexion looks for when assessing investment opportunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inflexion is an organization that is run by some extremely ambitious individuals; that seeps all the way down through the team, and we like to see that mirrored in the teams that we&rsquo;re working with,"" Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>The fact that healthcare is such a booming space at the moment, coupled with the growing realization that it can be a good match with private equity, can only be good news for both.</p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;Long&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Private equity, as a percentage of total deals &ndash; the number of transactions in M&amp;A markets in Europe &ndash; is about 8% within healthcare, and across all sectors, it&rsquo;s about 25%. So there&rsquo;s a huge penetration opportunity that means if you&rsquo;re an Inflexion or another specialist investor in the healthcare space, there are plenty of companies to invest in.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-23 11:09:00",,"healthcare, Inflexion, equity, private, companies, sciences, life, sector, money, business, MrLongsaid, teams, specialist, investment, businesses, ambitiou","There has never been a better time to raise money for companies in the life sciences sector, according to Ben Long, partner at UK-headquartered private equity f",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-22 18:00:56","2021-03-23 11:10:32",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/marriage-of-private-equity-and-healthcare-has-a-bright-future-specialist-investor-says,,,,,,ben_long_large.jpg,ben_long_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Business Financing, Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Feature, In Depth",UK,"Inflexion, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The data from MPOWERED showed that Mycapssa, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in June last year for acromegaly, improved clinical symptoms and other patient-reported outcomes compared to long-acting injectable somatostatin receptor ligands (iSRLs) in patients with acromegaly. In addition, Mycapssa met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin compared to long-acting iSRLs in maintenance of biochemical response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new encouraging data from all five late-breaking poster presentations further expand our understanding of oral octreotide capsules&rsquo; potential positive impact for patients with acromegaly who would otherwise need monthly, frequently burdensome SRLs injections,&rdquo; said Dr Maria Fleseriu, FACE, lead investigator of the MPOWERED study, Professor of Medicine and Neurological Surgery, Director of the Pituitary Center at Oregon Health and Science University&nbsp;in&nbsp;Portland, Oregon, and Immediate Past President of the&nbsp;Pituitary Society. &ldquo;As a practicing endocrinologist, I believe that these data provide valuable insights to physicians on the potential benefit of a twice daily oral drug versus long-acting injections for most patients,&rdquo; she noted.</p>
<p>Raj Kannan, chief executive of Chiasma, added: &ldquo;We are pleased to characterize further the Mycapssa product profile with the positive results from Chiasma&rsquo;s MPOWERED study at ENDO 2021 for the medical community. This is the first head-to-head large, non-inferiority Phase III trial in acromegaly that has been done to assess safety and efficacy, including the effect on acromegaly symptoms, and on patient satisfaction. Based on these data, we remain focused on submitting a marketing authorization application for Mycapssa to the European Medicines Agency planned for mid-2021.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Phase III REGN-COV 2067 study met its primary endpoint, comparing treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab with placebo.</p>
<p>The trial also met all key secondary endpoints, including the ability to reduce symptom duration from 14 to 10 days.</p>
<h2>Effective coronavirus treatment</h2>
<p>Developers Roche (ROG: SIX) and Regeneron (Nasdaq: REGN) have already been granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration to offer the treatment for high-risk patients with confirmed COVID-19.</p>
<p>The antibody combination has now been shown in clinical trials to be effective both as a therapeutic and as a passive vaccine against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Importantly, according to guidance from the US FDA, the combination is the only monoclonal antibody treatment to retain potency against key emerging variants.</p>
<p>The European regulator kicked off a rolling review of the treatment at the start of February, while the US government recently upped its order of the product from 300,000 to 1.5 million doses, at a cost of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest results, Roche chief medical officer Levi Garraway said: &ldquo;New infections continue to rise globally with over three million reported cases last week, so this investigational antibody cocktail may offer hope as a potential new therapy to high-risk patients - particularly in light of recent evidence showing that casirivimab and imdevimab together retain activity against key emerging variants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have rated Provention Bio with an Outperform rating, and a key opinion leader (KOL) in medicine is cited in a RBC report as expressing mixed views about the prospects of teplizumab.</p>
<h2>Approval 'would not be surprising'</h2>
<p>While the KOL referred to her own skepticism, she said that among colleagues there was excitement at the data from a Phase II trial. The conclusion reached by the KOL was that a US Food and Drug Administration approval would not be surprising, along with meaningful clinical acceptance.</p>
<p>Her concerns center on aspects of the data including the small sample size of the study, meaning long-term follow-up data and additional studies of larger sample size may be needed to demonstrate clinical significance of the treatment.</p>

<p>PH94B is designed with potential to provide rapid-onset acute treatment of anxiety for millions of individuals suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD) without directly activating gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA-A) receptors. PH94B&rsquo;s MOA is, therefore, fundamentally differentiated from the MOA of benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, diazepam and lorazepam, which are direct GABA-A receptor positive modulators.</p>
<p>Among VistaGen&rsquo;s core goals is for PH94B - rights to which it acquired from Pherin Pharmaceuticals in 2018 - to displace these and other widely-used but highly-addictive benzodiazepines in the acute treatment paradigm for SAD and other anxiety disorders and phobias.</p>
<h2><strong>Key results in the recent ADAA poster presentation include the following:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>PH94B had no significant effect on GABA potentiation at doses up to 10 micromolar, compared to the 300% potentiation induced by diazepam, a commonly-prescribed benzodiazepine.</li>
<li>The concentration of PH94B that gives the half-maximal response (EC50) could not be calculated for PH94B, whereas diazepam&rsquo;s half-maximal response (EC50) was 72 nanomolar.</li>
<li>PH94B had no agonist or antagonist effects on GABA receptors compared to the effect of GABA (EC50= 4.7 micromolar) and bicuculline (EC50= 1.6 micromolar), respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The results are in agreement with PH94B&rsquo;s lack of benzodiazepine-like side effects and safety concerns reported in PH94B clinical studies &ndash; for example, lack of sedation, cognitive impairment or abuse liability potential,&rdquo; said Dr Louis Monti, vice president, translational medicine of VistaGen. &ldquo;This study demonstrated that PH94B&rsquo;s mechanism of action is through neural regulation of forward inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the limbic amygdala and is differentiated from benzodiazepines&rsquo; mechanism of action, which is through a direct local potentiating effect on GABA receptors. These data are key in understanding PH94B&rsquo;s overall potential effectiveness and safety for individuals suffering from SAD and many other anxiety disorders,&rdquo; he noted.</p>

<p>Ivermectin first came to prominence as a treatment for patients who had contracted the novel coronavirus last Spring, when researchers at Australia&rsquo;s Monash University famously declared that the anti-parasitic drug already available around the world &lsquo;kills the virus within 48 hours.&rsquo; Ivermectin is the active ingredient of Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) Mectizan and Stromectil brands, but is also availabe as a generic.</p>
<p>In the European Union, ivermectin tablets are approved for treating some parasitic worm infestations while ivermectin skin preparations are approved for treating skin conditions such as rosacea. Ivermectin is also authorised for veterinary use for a wide range of animal species for internal and external parasites.</p>
<p>Ivermectin medicines are not authorized for use in COVID-19 in the EU, and the EMA has not received any application for such use.</p>
<p>Following recent media reports and publications on the use of ivermectin, the EMA reviewed the latest published evidence from laboratory studies, observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses.</p>
<h2><strong>Active at higher than approved concentrations</strong></h2>
<p>Laboratory studies found that ivermectin could block replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), but at much higher ivermectin concentrations than those achieved with the currently authorized doses.</p>
<p>Results from clinical studies were varied, with some studies showing no benefit and others reporting a potential benefit. Most studies the EMA reviewed were small and had additional limitations, including different dosing regimens and use of concomitant medications. The EMA therefore concluded that the currently available evidence is not sufficient to support the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 outside clinical trials.</p>","2021-03-22 14:22:00","EMA says ivermectin should not be used for COVID-19","Ivermectin, COVID-19, Prevention, Treatment, EMA","EMA says ivermectin should not be used for COVID-19",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-22 14:21:56","2021-03-22 14:31:51",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-says-ivermectin-should-not-be-used-for-covid-19,,,,,,ema-logo-large.jpg,ema_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Antibiotics, Infectious diseases","European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation",Europe,,Ivermectin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Faron provided an update from its ongoing Clevegen (bexmarilimab) MATINS study, indicating significant efficacy signals among a number of patients in Part II of the trial, alongside a recommendation from the study's data monitoring committee (DMC) to increase the dosing frequency in all cohorts showing early clinical benefits.</p>
<p>The Phase I/II MATINS clinical trial is investigating the tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy of bexmarilimab, Faron's wholly-owned novel precision cancer immunotherapy targeting Clever-1, a receptor known to be expressed on immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. In this trial bexmarilimab is being investigated as a potential monotherapy in patients with solid tumors who have exhausted all treatment options.</p>
<p>Analysts at Peel Hunt said this is &ldquo;intriguing&rdquo; data for bexmarilimab&rsquo;s potential across a range of hard-to-treat cancers while the committee&rsquo;s advice can potentially increase the number of patients that might benefit from the treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>
<p>As previously communicated, the first expansion stage (Part II) of the study has progressed significantly with strong patient recruitment across the 10 different hard-to-treat solid cancers under investigation. The latest data includes data from 67 Part II patients, and shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong survival benefit following four bexmarilimabtreatment cycles among the 10 responding patients (partial response or stable disease as best response according to the RECIST 1.1 classification). The overall risk of death among these bexmarilimab<em>-</em>responding patients was reduced by 88% (with a hazard ratio for death of 0.119, CI 0.016-0.863) compared to non-responding patients.</li>
<li>Within that 100-day treatment period, non-responding patients (57) continued to show progressive disease and 85% of these patients died (48).</li>
<li>Within the same period, only 10% of bexmarilimab<em>-</em>responding patients died (1/10) and median overall survival was not reached among these responders.</li>
<li>Responding patients showed a clear prolongation of progression free survival (PFS), with a 93% reduction in the risk of disease progression (with a hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.068, CI 0.016-0.290) compared to non-responding patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>""This is very exciting data supporting bexmarilimab's unique mechanism of action and adding to the accumulating evidence of bexmarilimab&rsquo;s broad potential across a range of hard-to-treat cancers. The early observations of survival benefit and the stark contrast in progression of disease among patients who do not respond to bexmarilimab therapy show the clinical significance of Clever-1 as immunotherapy target and the potential patient benefit when its immune-suppressive control is removed. We look forward to gathering further data from these patient cohorts to support the design of our pivotal trials for bexmarilimab,"" said Faron&rsquo;s chief executive Dr Markku Jalkanen.</p>","2021-03-22 12:02:00",,"Faron Pharmaceuticals, Clevegen, Bexmarilimab, Phase I/II, Tumors, Solid","Faron Pharma leaps on new data for Clevegen",,1,"Faron Pharma leaps on new data for Clevegen",3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-22 11:59:29","2021-03-22 12:07:33",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/faron-pharma-leaps-on-new-data-for-clevegen,,,,,,faron-big-1.png,faron-small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Drug Trial, Research",Finland,"Faron Pharmaceuticals","bexmarilimab, Clevegen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In the study, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) coronavirus vaccine was 79% effective at preventing symptomatic disease and 100% effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization.</p>
<p>Importantly, results from the large trial show vaccine efficacy was consistent across different ethnic and age groups, with 80% effectiveness in the over-65s.</p>
<p>The vaccine has already been approved and is in use in multiple countries, including the UK and in Europe.</p>
<h2>European confusion</h2>
<p>While real-world evidence has shown the vaccine&rsquo;s efficacy in older people, there has until now been a lack of clinical data from large trials confirming efficacy for this at-risk group.</p>
<p>This had led some European regulators to advise against its use in older people, with French President Emmanuel Macron even stating it was likely &ldquo;quasi-ineffective on people older than 65.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commentators have now questioned whether the approach of European countries could have dented public confidence in the vaccine.</p>
<p>The positive outcome from the American trial should help counter that effect, adding to subsequent affirmations of safety and efficacy from the European Medicines Agency and others.</p>
<p>This was deemed necessary after several European countries paused their use of the product in order to investigate reports of blood clotting events.</p>
<p>These suspensions came despite safety data from more than 17 million people vaccinated in the EU and the UK showing no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p>In the USA-based trial, independent data safety monitors conducted a specific review of thrombotic events and found no increased risk of thrombosis or similar events in those who received the vaccine.</p>
<p>Executive vice president of R&amp;D for biopharma, Mene Pangalos, said: &ldquo;These results add to the growing body of evidence that shows this vaccine is well tolerated and highly effective against all severities of COVID-19 and across all age groups.&rdquo;</p>

With the registration, the expectation is that ANVISA will authorize the release of the first batches, so that Fiocruz can deliver to the PNI the first one million Covid-19 vaccines produced by the institution.</p>
<p>""Just six months after signing the Technology Order Agreement, we have already started production of a COVID-19 vaccine, based on one of the most advanced technologies at the moment, and obtained its registration for wide distribution in the country. The urgency imposed on us by the seriousness of this pandemic has made everyone involved work tirelessly and be able to accomplish in months a process that normally takes years.

The first line in operation was already producing about 300,000 doses per day. The expectation is to reach the end of March with production of about one million doses per day.</p>
<p>With this, the Foundation expects to deliver 3.8 million doses to the Ministry of Health by the end of March. In April, the delivery estimate will increase to about 30 million doses, and by July Fiocruz should complete the delivery of the 100 million doses resulting from the technology order agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN).&nbsp;</p>

488101,,"Hungarian patients have ever better chances, but still work to be done, says trade group","According to a summary published by the Hungarian Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (AIPM) on the occasion of the Rare Disease Day, increasingly effective innovative therapies present a new opportunity for patients.","<p>According to a summary published by the Hungarian Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (AIPM) on the occasion of the Rare Disease Day, increasingly effective innovative therapies present a new opportunity for patients.</p>
<p>Diseases that affect one in more than 2,000 people are considered rare diseases. Their significance is well illustrated by the fact that 300 million people worldwide have some kind of rare disease, about half of whom are children. In the European Union, almost 30 million people is directly affected and 100 million indirectly affected, including family members. Four-fifths of rare diseases are of genetic origin, while the remaining ones are caused by bacterial and viral infections or environmental factors.</p>
<h2><strong>Hungary at the forefront of the region</strong></h2>
<p>The AIPM says that Hungary is a leader in the treatment of rare diseases in its region, as almost 40% of the latest therapies approved by the European Medicines Agency for rare hematological, oncological, neurological and metabolic diseases, among others, are available with domestic funding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is particularly important because rare diseases affect about 600,000 people in Hungary, for whom access to innovative, effective therapies offers a new chance to either recover or alleviate or prevent the deterioration of their complaints.</p>
<p>Hungary&rsquo;s achievements in this field are due to the supportive and helpful attitude of the National Health Insurance Fund, which provides funding, as well as the constructive cooperation of the innovative pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The AIPM expects that access to innovative medicinal products for rare diseases will become even smoother in the future, and that newly-developed therapies for other, more frequent, but serious diseases will reach patients in Hungary faster and more widely than before, as this would not only reduce the burden on the healthcare system, but it would offer a new opportunity for even more Hungarian patients,&rdquo; commented AIPM director Dr Peter Holchacker.</p>

<p>Among last week&rsquo;s notable research news, Eli Lilly presented updated results on its Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease candidate donanemab which, though touted as promising in a disease area that has been filled with failures, is seen as disappointing by some. Meantime, strong Phase III results saw Sanofi and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals halt their trial of Libtayo in cervical cancer. On the deal-making front, rivals in the HIV space Gilead Sciences and Merck &amp; Co signed a pact last Monday to trial a combination of their respective candidates &ndash; lenacapavir and islatravir. Regulatory news saw AbbVie suffer a setback last Wednesday, when the US Food and Drug Administration extended the review period for its Rinvoq in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis.</p>
<h2><strong>Lilly&rsquo;s donanemab has much to prove</strong></h2>
<p>Those with high hopes heading into today&rsquo;s presentation of Eli Lilly&rsquo;s Phase II <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mixed-but-encouraging-results-for-lilly-s-donanemab-in-alzheimer-s"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study</a> will be disappointed to learn that the primary endpoint was only just met, and that the key secondary measure failed to reach significance, commented Amy Brown on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>True, the trial was technically a success and the data overall seemed to move in the right direction, something that is rarely seen in the Alzheimer&rsquo;s field. But it seems certain that the FDA will want to see results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial, due in 2023, before it reviews the project; any expectations of a swift filing will be snuffed out by these data. (</p>
<p>Still, Biogen is seeking approval for its similarly acting beta-amyloid MAb, aducanumab, on questionable data and what many believe to be a marginal effect. Should that project be approved in June &ndash; an outcome that is far from assured &ndash; a low bar would be set for donanemab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is notable how Lilly&rsquo;s bullish claims for the outcome contrast starkly with the much more moderate conclusions of the full paper, said Ms Brown. The authors conclude that donanemab resulted in &ldquo;modestly less cognitive and functional decline than placebo.&rdquo; Slowing disease progression by half, which the trial was powered to show, was not achieved.</p>
<p>The significance of the hit on the primary endpoint is lessened somewhat by the use of a measure not well known in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease research, iARDS. Lilly had already disclosed that donanemab slowed clinical decline on iARDS by a statistically significant 32% relative to the control arm. Today a 0.04 p value was disclosed, and an absolute benefit of 3.20 points on the scale.</p>
<p>Amber Tong, writing on EndPoints Weekly, noted that nothing drums up excitement and controversy quite as instantly and intensely as Alzheimer&rsquo;s &mdash; as Eli Lilly has once again demonstrated with the presentation of mixed results &nbsp;&nbsp;from its Phase II trial of donanemab. While the pharma giant heralded a statistically-significant result for the unconventional primary endpoint it chose, even the optimists were cautious to jump to conclusions while critics homed in on the meh numbers on the secondary endpoints (which represented more traditional metrics used in previous studies) and side effects. Lilly, though, maintained the data were &ldquo;tremendously important&rdquo; and is upbeat about its upcoming pivotal before heading to regulators &mdash; by which time they may also have a precedent in Biogen&rsquo;s aducanumab.</p>
<h2><strong>Libtayo advances with positive Phase III cervical cancer data</strong></h2>
<p>Regeneron announced positive top-line data for the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/trial-of-libtayo-stopped-early-on-strong-phase-iii-data"">Phase III Libtayo</a> (cemiplimab) monotherapy study in advanced cervical cancer. The trial was stopped early due to positive overall survival (OS) benefit in the Libtayo arm compared to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>SVB Leering Research analyst Geoffrey Porges believes the results are compelling and should support a regulatory approval for Libtayo in advanced cervical cancer as a monotherapy. Based on the trial design, which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 status, he believes Libtayo could potentially have a broader label versus Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda, which requires PD-L1 testing for tumors that have a combined positive score (CPS) of &ge;1.</p>
<p>Regeneron anticipates that the data will support regulatory submission in 2021, which if approved would be Libtayo&rsquo;s fourth indication to receive approval behind cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He believes the indication is relatively small, with a 2020 global market of ~$60 million (Keytruda comprising ~$17 million), but expected to grow to $1 billion in 2026 driven by the entrance of new checkpoint inhibitors such as Agenus&rsquo; balstilimab (PD-1) and zalifrelimab (CTLA4). Mr Porges believe Libtayo could be competitive in this emerging indication if the approved label forgoes PD-L1 testing, but ultimately, he expects significant revenue growth to be driven by success from Regeneron&rsquo;s pipeline I/O combination treatments such as the costim-bispecifics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Lenacapavir and islatravir finally hooking up but not exclusive</strong></h2>
<p>Gilead Sciences and Merck &amp; Co last week announced they will co-develop Gilead&rsquo;s lenacapavir and Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s islatravir as <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-and-gilead-partner-on-hiv-treatment-combo"">long-acting HIV therapies</a>. Analysts at SVB Leerink Research view the collaboration as ideal from a risk- and capital management perspective, bringing together two assets that seem highly complementary and could meaningfully improve on treatment adherence and disease control. The terms appear to have required significant negotiation and compromise, with Gilead investors likely to be concerned about mid-term cannibalization of Gilead&rsquo;s highly profitable HIV product sales.</p>
<p>Development costs will be split 60/40 with Gilead taking the larger share of the expenses. Revenue will be split 50/50 up to $2 billion or $3.5 billion (global net product sales) for the LOA and LAI injectable products, respectively. Above those hurdle rates the split becomes 65/35 for Gilead/Merck. Gilead disclosed they believe the oral combination product could reach the market in 2025 at the earliest, with the injectable formulation following in 2027. The first clinical trials of the combinations are expected in second half 2021.</p>
<p>Merk is also evaluating islatravir with its wholly-owned doravirine (Pifeltro), an approved once-daily non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and MK-8507, a more potent investigational NNRTI intended for once-weekly administration. Islatravir alone is also being developed for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), with a PK profile that supports once-monthly oral administration or protection for a year when delivered as part of a subdermal implant, as suggested by Phase I data recently presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI).</p>
<p>These product profiles could improve the compliance seen with approved once-daily options for PREP (Truvada, Descovy), and appear more convenient than promising long-acting injectables in development (cabotegravir every eight weeks). The Leerink analysts currently model $1.4 billion in peak sales for islatravir but are reviewing this estimate following recent updates.</p>
<p>Adding her voice, Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage noted that long-acting HIV therapies are shaping up to be competitive. But Gilead and Merck are calling a truce &ndash; at least in part &ndash; to develop combinations of their respective projects lenacapavir, a capsid inhibitor, and islatravir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal also covers an option for either company to license the other&rsquo;s oral integrase inhibitors, which are currently preclinical, for combination. But outside the agreement the groups remain fierce rivals in HIV, the Merck execs stressed.</p>
<h2><strong>FDA crackdown: JAK Rinvoq PDUFA in PsA extended</strong></h2>
<p>AbbVie announced that the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-extends-review-period-for-rinvoq"">FDA has extended the target date for Rinvoq</a> in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) after responding to an information request earlier, and AbbVie said that a similar request had been received for Rinvoq&rsquo;s pending application in atopic dermatitis, commented SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>He presumes this means that the action date for atopic dermatitis (AD) is extended as well. This is another example of what is clearly a new regulatory approach from the FDA &ndash; every potentially questionable or uncertain approval event seems to be pushed out, or re-evaluated, whereas investors may have had a high degree of confidence in their approval in the prior administration. This is likely to increase the perceived level of risk to the industry&rsquo;s outlook, and add more pressure on what are already discounted multiples compared to the market.</p>
<p>While two events don&rsquo;t make a trend, three events do start making the case for a tougher posture from the FDA under the new administration, said Mr Porges . However, &ldquo;tougher&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean good drugs won&rsquo;t get approved, and Rinvoq&rsquo;s strong efficacy data and tolerable safety profile support approval, in his view, even if AbbVie has to weather a three-month delay before a decision. This regulatory dynamic may have read-through to any drugs with target action dates in the first half of 2021, with potentially more review delays likely until the industry and investors become accustomed to the standards and practices of regulatory reviews in the new administration.</p>
<p>Also commenting, Lisa Urquhart on Evaluate Vantage noted that Rinvoq has long been touted as one of AbbVie&rsquo;s get-out-of-jail-free cards once biosimilar competition to the group's bestseller, Humira, hits in 2023. However, Rinvoq&rsquo;s saviour status depends on the JAK inhibitor&rsquo;s ability to extend its approved indications beyond rheumatoid arthritis. So, news that the US FDA is extending Rinvoq&rsquo;s review in psoriatic arthritis by three months, and also has questions about another label extension into atopic dermatitis, did not play well; AbbVie shares slumped 6% in morning trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AbbVie had been hoping to challenge the market leader, Sanofi&rsquo;s Dupixent, in atopic dermatitis, and the signs had looked good, with Rinvoq comprehensively beating Dupixent head-to-head last year. But success was tempered by toxicity issues and one reported death. While there are arguments that Rinvoq is one of the safest JAK inhibitors on the market, the class as whole has been dogged by safety concerns, and <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/snippets/what-could-xeljanzs-new-safety-scare-cost-jak-inhibitors"">a recent scare from Xeljanz</a> could have prompted more caution from the regulator, Ms Urquhart noted.</p>","2021-03-21 11:25:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 19, 2021","News review, Eli Lilly, Donanemab, Regeneron, Sanofi, Libtayo, Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co, Lenacapavir, Islatravir, AbbVie, Rinvoq","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 19, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-21 11:23:54","2021-03-21 11:38:59",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-19-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Anti-virals, CNS Diseases, Neurological, Oncology","Deals, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research, US FDA",,"AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi","donanemab, islatravir, lenacapavir, Libtayo, Rinvoq",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

The stock was still up 47.7% at $7.86 by close of trading.</p>
<p>Presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Virtual Annual Meeting on Women&rsquo;s Cancer (SGO), the ARIEL 4 study data demonstrate that Rubraca significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, among patients with advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer and a deleterious BRCA mutation who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Data from the ARIEL4 study meaningfully enhance our understanding about the role of Rubraca among women with BRCA mutation-positive relapsed ovarian cancer, as well as the clinical relevance of BRCA reversion mutations,&rdquo; said Dr Rebecca Kristeleit, co-coordinating Investigator of ARIEL4 and Consultant Medical Oncologist, Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. &ldquo;This is important because women with more advanced disease have fewer treatment options, and it is increasingly important to understand how specific mutations affect treatment outcomes,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>
<p>The ARIEL4 study (NCT02855944) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized study evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in fully platinum-sensitive, partially platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed PFS, with a step-down analysis from the primary efficacy population (if significant) to the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ARIEL4 data add to the growing scientific understanding about the clinical utilization of Rubraca compared to chemotherapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, for women diagnosed with BRCA mutation-positive advanced ovarian cancer,&rdquo; said Patrick Mahaffy, president and chief executive of Clovis. &ldquo;We remain committed to expanding treatment options for patients living with cancer and are pleased to share these data with physicians and their patients to help improve outcomes for women with ovarian cancer,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Ovarian cancer market</strong></h2>
<p>According to industry analytics firm GlobalData, the ovarian cancer market was valued at $1.8 billion in 2018 across the seven major markets (7MM: USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan), and it is expected to grow to $6.7 billion in the next 10 years with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.4%.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration first granted accelerated approval to Rubraca to treat women with a certain type of ovarian cancer in 2016, and has since cleared the drug as maintenance treatment option for recurrent ovarian cancer as well as BRCA1/2-mutant castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Clovis reported global net product revenues for Rubraca of $43.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, which included US product revenues of $36.4 million and ex-US product revenues of $6.9 million, respectively.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-20 15:08:00","Clovis Oncology soars as Rubraca scores in ovarian cancer trial","Clovis Oncology, Rubraca, Ovarian cancer, Phase III, PFS","Clovis Oncology soars as Rubraca scores in ovarian cancer trial",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-20 15:07:04","2021-03-20 15:14:10",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clovis-oncology-soars-as-rubraca-scores-in-ovarian-cancer-trial,,,,,,clovis_large-1-.jpg,clovis_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Ovarian cancer",Biotechnology,Oncology,"Drug Trial, Research",USA,"Clovis Oncology",Rubraca,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488096,,"Weekly HGH jabs rushing to China","China has been relying on daily human growth hormone (HGH) injections to treat growth hormone deficiency (GHD), but this is likely to change, if not soon.","<p>By Wang Fangqing</p>
<p>China has been relying on daily human growth hormone (HGH) injections to treat growth hormone deficiency (GHD), but this is likely to change, if not soon, writes The Pharma Letter's local correspondent.</p>
<p>For example, Denmark&rsquo;s Novo Nordisk (NOV: N) in December gained approval of its investigational new drug (IND) application in China for its Sogroya (somapacitan-beco/somatropin analog), a long acting HGH weekly injection that received Food and Drug Administration clearance in September 2020 for adult with GHD in the USA.</p>
<p>In China, the studies will be conducted among children, according to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). The Danish pharma in 2018 launched its daily therapy Norditropin (somatropin/rHGH) for children and adults in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aim of developing Sogroya is to reduce the&nbsp;treatment burden for patients by reducing injection frequency and potentially improving treatment adherence,&rdquo; a Novo Nordisk spokesman told the Pharma Letter. Daily injection, he said, is not something patients want for a lifetime treatment and does not encourage adherence.</p>
<p>Indeed, China has about 7 million patients with the rare disease aged between four and 15, but fewer than 30,000 are going through therapies, according to Chinese Medical Association.</p>
<p>Currently, there is only one major weekly HGH therapy in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Approved in 2014, Jin Sai Zeng is a polyethylene glycol (PEGlyed) rHGH weekly injection supplied by Changchun, Jilin province-based GeneScience. The company&rsquo;s daily treatment Sai Zeng dominates the HGH sector with a market share of nearly 70%, according to 2018 research carried out by the NMPA&rsquo;s research arm PICO.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Current daily options</strong></h2>
<p>Other daily rHGH options include Pfizer&rsquo;s (NYSE: PFE) Genotropin (somatropin), LG Chem&rsquo;s Eutropin, and Ansomeone from Hefei-based Anke Bio, but Norditropin is the only treatment that can be stored at room temperature.</p>
<p>HGH therapies are covered by China&rsquo;s national reimbursement list under category B, meaning patients will have to bear the most cost. It may explain why Jin Sai Zeng&rsquo;s market share was just 11%, according to the 2018 PICO research, despite its privilege as the only weekly treatment in China.</p>
<p>Priced at about 5,600 renminbi ($860.2) per unit (54IU/9mg/1ml), Jin Sai Zeng typically costs about 190,000 renminbi per year for a patient, compared with 42,000 renminbi for liquid HGH injections and CNY20,000 for power HGH injections, according to government procurement prices.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk is not the only one in the long-acting HGH game. In mid-March, China gave IND approval to a weekly rHGH from Yifan Pharma, a Lin&rsquo;an, Zhejiang province-based company.</p>
<p>There is also Visen, a Shanghai-based biotech start-up backed by the Danish biotech Ascendis Pharma (Nasdaq: ASND), and a group of investors including Vivo Capital. Visen is carrying out Phase III studies in China among children for lonapegsomatropin, a weekly rHCH from Ascendis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The asset, using transient conjunction to control drug release, has gained orphan drug designation for GHD in the USA and Europe. It is in Phase III studies among adults in the USA and is expected to get FDA approval as soon as in June 2021.</p>
<p>Visen&rsquo;s rival I-Mab Biopharma (Nasdaq: IMAB) is also conducting Phase III studies in China among children for its asset eftansomatropin, a weekly rHGH injection developed by an I-Mab&rsquo;s early investor - the Korean biotech Genexine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Facing the upcoming competition, Novo Nordisk is confident</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We have more than three decades of dedication and commitment to the pediatric and adult growth hormone communities. Our solid understanding of the GHD communities enables us to reduce patients&acute; burden of therapy and meet their lifestyle needs,&rdquo; said the company spokesman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk in November signed an agreement with the local government in Shanghai to invest 200 million renminbi building a facility in the city that covers drug imports, distribution, marketing and R&amp;D to speed up bringing its novel drugs into the country.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-19 16:07:00","Weekly HGH jabs rushing to China","Human growth hormone, GHD, Weekly, Developments, Novo Nordisk, Sogroya, Pfizer, Genotropin, I-MAB, Eftansomatropin","Weekly HGH jabs rushing to China",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-19 16:04:18","2021-03-19 16:18:43",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/weekly-hgh-jabs-rushing-to-china,,,,,,china_beijing_big.jpg,china_beijing_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Growth hormones",Pharmaceutical,"Endocrinology, Rare diseases","Asia Pacific, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Markets & Marketing, Research",China,"I-Mab Biopharma, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer","eftansomatropin, Genotropin, Sogroya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The firm is testing its investigational immunotherapy tilsotolimod, in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Yervoy (ipilimumab), in refractory advanced melanoma.</p>
<p>Spying a high level of unmet medical need in anti-PD1 refractory patients, Idera estimates that peak US sales for the product could reach $500 million in this indication, if approved.</p>
<p>The firm, which is hoping to make the synthetic Toll-like receptor 9 agonist its first approved medicine, saw its shares fall back over 60% in pre-market trading on Friday.</p>
<h2>Development setback</h2>
<p>Results show ILLUMINATE-301, which pits the combo against treatment with Yervoy alone, did not meet its primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR).</p>
<p>Idera said it was mulling whether to continue the trial toward its overall survival (OS) endpoint, and that it would evaluate the full data set when it is available.</p>
<p>The company also plans to continue its ILLUMINATE-206 Phase II study of tilsotolimod in a triplet combination with both Yervoy and Opdivo (nivolumab), in colorectal cancer.</p>

<p>The FDA granted the approval of Arcalyst to Bermuda-headquartered Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: KNSA), whose shares were up more than 7% at $23.28 in pre-market trading. The company said commercial launch is expected in April 2021.</p>
<p>Recurrent pericarditis is characterized by a remitting-relapsing inflammation (or symptoms that fluctuate in severity) of the pericardium, a thin tissue sac surrounding the heart. Pericarditis often causes chest pain, which can be sharp. This chest pain worsens when patients take a deep breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The approval of Arcalyst in recurrent pericarditis offers patients the first and only FDA approved therapy for this devastating disease and also represents a transformational event for Kiniksa,&rdquo; said Sanj Patel, chief executive and chairman of Kiniksa. &ldquo;We look forward to launching Arcalyst for recurrent pericarditis with the support of our experienced commercial and medical affairs teams and, importantly, providing this breakthrough therapy to patients suffering with this debilitating disease as quickly as possible,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of Arcalyst were0 evaluated in a double-blind, randomized study enrolling 86 patients with symptomatic pericarditis recurrence. Everyone first received Arcalyst for 12 weeks. After that point, one half of patients continued to receive Arcalyst 160 mg weekly and the other half received a placebo. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the time to first pericarditis recurrence. Results showed that 23 (74%) patients in the placebo arm had a recurrence compared to two (7%) patients on Arcalyst, both of whom had temporarily stopped treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Drug, discovered by Regeneron, gained earlier approvals</strong></h2>
<p>Arcalyst was discovered by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: REGN), and received initial FDA approval in February 2008 for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome, and subsequent approval for the maintenance of remission of deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) in December 2020</p>
<p>Kiniksa licensed Arcalyst from Regeneron in 2017 for evaluation in diseases believed to be mediated by both interleukin (IL)-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta;, including recurrent pericarditis. Upon this approval by the FDA for recurrent pericarditis, Kiniksa takes responsibility for sales and distribution of Arcalyst for all the approved indications in the USA, including CAPS and DIRA, and will evenly split profits with Regeneron, as described in the Arcalyst license agreement.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-19 12:39:00","FDA approves first treatment for recurrent pericarditis","Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Arcalyst, Rilonacept, FDA, Approval, Pericarditis, Regeneron","FDA approves first treatment for recurrent pericarditis",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-19 12:38:39","2021-03-19 12:47:03",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-first-treatment-for-recurrent-pericarditis,,,,,,kiniksa_big.png,kiniksa_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Cardio-vascular, Rare diseases","Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation, US FDA","Bermuda, USA","Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals","Arcalyst, Rilonacept",,,,"Recurrent pericarditis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Incyte&rsquo;s shares closed down 2.4% at $78.25 on Thursday.</p>
<p>While results indicate a trend towards an improvement in mortality in the overall study population (N=211), the DEVENT study did not meet its primary endpoint - mortality due to any cause through day 29 - adjusted for ARDS severity between the two treatment arms versus placebo (55.2% versus 74.3% [Odds Ratio (OR): 0.42 (95% CI: 0.171-1.023)], P=0.0280 in the 5mg arm and 51.8% vs 69.6% [OR: 0.46 (95% CI: 0.201-1.028)], P=0.0292 in the 15mg arm).</p>
<p>In December, Incyte and Novartis (NOVN: VX), which has licensed rights to Jakafi outside the USA, released results from the Phase III RUXCOVID study, showing that there was no significant reduction in the proportion of COVID-19 patients on ruxolitinib plus standard therapy experiencing severe complications, compared to standard care alone.</p>
<p>In the DEVENT study, the safety profile was generally consistent with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and consistent with treatment with ruxolitinib. The most common adverse events on the ruxolitinib arms, regardless of dose, compared to placebo were anemia (20.7% vs 22.2%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 14.6% vs 13.3%), increased aspartate transaminase (AST, 14.0% vs. 8.9%) and hypertension (11.6% vs. 11.1%), respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Will make drug available free under EAP</strong></p>
<p>Given the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, Incyte plans to make ruxolitinib available to eligible patients in the USA at no cost via an Expanded Access Program (EAP) pending agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration. The protocol will allow eligible patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS with disease severity requiring mechanical ventilation to receive ruxolitinib.</p>

<p>The PRAC has concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in combating COVID-19, which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal, continue to outweigh the risk of side effects.</p>
<p>The vaccine was found not to be associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots in those who receive it and there is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites.</p>
<p>However, the PRAC did find that the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are rare cases &ndash; around 20 million people in the UK and European Economic Area had received the vaccine as of March 16 and the EMA had reviewed only seven cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels and 18 cases of CVST,&rdquo; an EMA statement reads. &ldquo;A causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and deserves further analysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PRAC involved experts in blood disorders in its review, and worked closely with other health authorities including the UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, which has experience with administration of this vaccine to around 11 million people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overall, the number of thromboembolic events reported after vaccination, both in studies before licensing and in reports after rollout of vaccination, was lower than that expected in the general population,&rdquo; the EMA statement adds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This allows PRAC to confirm that there is no increase in overall risk of blood clots. However, in younger patients there remain some concerns, related in particular to these rare cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steps are being taken to update the product information for the vaccine to include more information on these risks, and PRAC is continuing to investigate, including looking at the safety of other COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>Takeda has entered into as strategic collaboration with USA-based small-molecule mRNA translation specialist Anima Biotech to discover and develop a new class of medicines for genetically-defined neurological diseases.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Anima will use its Translation Control Therapeutics platform to discover novel mRNA translation modulators against the collaboration targets. The parties will collaborate to advance the molecules to clinical candidates, which Takeda has the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize.</p>
<p>The pre-clinical research collaboration will initially include Anima&rsquo;s early Huntington&rsquo;s disease program against the HTT target, selectively inhibiting the mutated protein with small molecules and two additional targets named by Takeda, related to neurological diseases.</p>
<p>This partnership builds on <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lilly-inks-1-billion-plus-deal-for-translation-inhibitors-of-several-protein-targets"">Anima&rsquo;s previous collaboration with Eli Lilly</a> in July 2018 that could exceed more than $1 billion for the discovery and development of translation inhibitors for several target proteins using Anima&rsquo;s Translation Control Therapeutics platform.</p>
<p>For Takeda, it is a second bet in the Huntington&rsquo;s space, as it adds to the $230 million <a href=""/content/article/edit/id/V"">deal with Wave Life Science</a> consummated in February 2018.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial terms of the deal</strong></h2>
<p>Takeda will pay Anima up to around $120 million in upfront and pre-clinical research milestone payments and up to $1.1 billion in clinical and commercial milestones, assuming success of the three programs. Anima is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of each product resulting from the collaboration.

<p>They will conduct a Phase IIb double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and a fixed-dose combination of Gilead&rsquo;s investigational FXR agonist cilofexor and investigational ACC inhibitor firsocostat, alone and in combination in people with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH.</p>
<p>The four-arm study in approximately 440 patients will evaluate the treatments&rsquo; impact on liver fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution and will begin recruitment in the second half of 2021.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This collaboration represents successful execution of our overarching corporate strategy to marry in-house organic growth with strategic in-licensing and partnerships to develop our multi-asset multi-platform portfolio,&rdquo; said Dr Lara Sullivan, chief executive of Pyxis, adding: &ldquo;We look forward to advancing these candidates to the clinic and ultimately achieving the company&rsquo;s vision to bring new treatment options to patients with difficult-to-treat cancer.""</p>
<p>Dr Sullivan was the former founder and president of the Pfizer spinout SpringWorks Therapeutics, and was previously an executive at Pfizer itself.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the licensing accord, Pfizer will provide Pyxis with a worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize two innovative ADC candidates, PYX-201 and PYX-203. Pfizer will receive an upfront payment and equity in Pyxis and is eligible to receive development and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties on potential sales.</p>
<h2><strong>Also gains license to Pfizer&rsquo;s ADC platform</strong></h2>
<p>As part of this agreement, Pyxis also was granted a license to Pfizer&rsquo;s ADC platform, including various payload classes, linker technology and site-specific conjugation techniques for the future development of additional ADCs. Pfizer will also continue to support the development and advancement of this portfolio through an equity investment made by Pfizer Ventures.</p>
<p>Ronald Herbst, chief scientific officer of Pyxis, said: &ldquo;The early generations of ADCs demonstrated significant potency, but considerable room remains for innovation to generate highly effective ADCs with an improved safety profile. PYX-201 and PYX-203 represent the next generation of ADCs that use innovative conjugation technologies. By combining highly specific antibodies targeting clinically validated tumor markers with established linkers and both novel and proven payloads, we are excited to translate the extensive validating preclinical studies conducted by Pfizer to an improved clinical profile for patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff Settleman, Pfizer&rsquo;s chief scientific officer of oncology research and development, added: &ldquo;The Pyxis team of industry veterans led by Dr Sullivan and Dr Herbst has the experience needed to maximize the clinical potential of these therapeutics. This agreement underscores our commitment to ensure these molecules reach patients as quickly as possible. We look forward to the team&rsquo;s advancement of these therapeutics based on the promise of ADC technology to significantly impact the treatment landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PYX-201 is a first-in-class non-internalizing ADC that targets a tumor-restricted antigen that is overexpressed in several solid tumor types to selectively kill tumor cells while enhancing a robust anti-cancer immune response. PYX-203 is an ADC that targets an antigen expressed in certain hematologic malignancies. PYX-203 utilizes a highly potent DNA-damaging agent designed to reduce the potential development of drug resistance and disease relapse.</p>

<p>The firms are developing a synthetic peptide, pegcetacoplan, which regulates a key part of the body's immune system.</p>
<p>Top-line data for the targeted C3 therapy, announced in December 2020, showed it led to sustained hematological and clinical improvements for people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).</p>
<p>The trial showed Sobi and Apellis&rsquo; option was superior in reducing hemoglobin levels compared with eculizumab, which is marketed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; (Nasdaq: ALXN) as Soliris.</p>
<p>In addition, 85% of pegcetacoplan-treated patients were transfusion free over 16 weeks versus 15% of eculizumab-treated patients.</p>
<p>The results could be significant, given that Alexion&rsquo;s blockbuster therapy generated over $4 billion in revenues last year.</p>
<p>Spying an opportunity across treatment settings, the firms plan to jointly advance five parallel registration programs including two new registrational programs in hematology this year.</p>
<p>As well as in PNH, Sobi and Apellis plan to test pegcetacoplan as an option for cold agglutinin disease (CAD) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA), plus indications in nephrology and neurology.</p>

<p>Arun Krishna, Head of Oncology at AstraZeneca UK, said: &ldquo;Until recently, standard treatment for less fit, treatment na&iuml;ve, non-high risk CLL patients was chemo immunotherapy that is administered in hospital,&rdquo; commented Arun Krishna, head of oncology at AstraZeneca UK, adding: &ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic made even more acute the need for effective treatments that can be taken at home. In response, AstraZeneca enabled early access to acalabrutinib in April 2020 for patients within this at-need population. Today&rsquo;s welcome news from NICE means that this medicine will now become routinely available to CLL patients within the NHS, helping to improve the outcomes of patients living with this disease.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acalabrutinib was licensed for use in Europe and the UK in November 2020 as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.</p>
<p>Anna Schuh, associate professor and honorary consultant hematologist at Oxford University, noted: &ldquo;This NICE recommendation has the potential to improve disease outcomes for thousands of patients with CLL in the UK. There has been a significant unmet need for effective, targeted treatments that are well tolerated and that do not require multiple hospital visits, especially for patients in need of treatment for the first time. Acalabrutinib is generally well-tolerated and therefore represents a welcome new treatment option for older and frail patients. The NICE recommendation is therefore excellent news for the CLL community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-18 10:08:00","NICE backing for AstraZeneca’s Calquence in CLL","AstraZeneca, Calquence, Leukemia, CLL, NICE, NHS use","NICE backing for AstraZeneca’s Calquence in CLL",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-18 09:53:38","2021-03-18 10:08:17",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nice-backing-for-astrazeneca-s-calquence-in-cll,,,,,,astrazeneca_big.jpg,astrazeneca_small-1.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Hematology, Oncology","Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access",UK,"AstraZeneca, NICE",Calquence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

The rising costs of raw materials from China has pushed the NPPA to take this decision.","<p>India's drug pricing regulatory agency, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), has extended the revised ceiling price of Heparin Injection up to September 2021. The rising costs of raw materials from China has pushed the NPPA to take this decision.<br /> <br /> Earlier in the year, the NPPA had hiked the price of the essential blood thinner by 50% and extended the price hike till March 31, 2021. This has now been further extended.<br /> <br /> The price revision was based on a Union Health Ministry committee report which noted a 211% increase in the price of heparin&rsquo;s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as compared to the base year of September 2018.<br /> <br /> Some of the brands of heparin are Hep and Hep-Lock by Gland Pharma, Lofh by Abbott Laboratories, and Celparin by Celon Laboratories. Other companies like Biological E, Samarth Lifesciences and Troikaa Pharmaceuticals also market heparin products in India.</p>
<h2><strong>Drugmakers reached out to govt last year</strong></h2>
<p>Several drugmakers had reached out to the government early last year with a proposal to bring a law under which price hikes could be made possible due to unforeseen factors.<br /> <br /> The NPPA had extended the ceiling prices of heparin injection 1000IU/ ml and heparin injection 5000IU/ ml fixed under Para 19 of the Drugs Prices Control Order (DPCO) and had invoked its extraordinary powers in the public interest to ensure consistent availability of the drug, in view of the increase in API costs from China in the COVID-19 scenario.<br /> <br /> The Federation of Pharmaceutical Entrepreneurs, a lobbyist body, has been alleging that China is increasing the prices of some key raw materials. As an official pointed out, an organic compound used in making paracetamol, para-aminophenol, cost around $3.2 to $3.5 per kilogram last year. Its price now is around $7.3 to $7.5 per kg.<br /> <br /> The regulator noted manufacturers&rsquo; concern that, over the years, the regulated price has decreased, while that of the API imported from China has consistently increased, which made production of the drug commercially unviable.</p>","2021-03-18 10:07:00","Rising Chinese prices cause India’s NPPA to hike heparin ceiling price","NPPA, Heparin, Ceiling price, APIs, Chinese","Rising Chinese prices cause India’s NPPA to hike heparin ceiling price",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-17 18:18:37","2021-03-18 10:07:41",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rising-chinese-prices-cause-india-s-nppa-to-hike-heparin-ceiling-price,,,,,,india_big.jpg,india_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Heparins, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority",Generics,Hematology,"Focus On, Government Affairs, Pricing, reimbursement and access","China, India",,heparin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>AbbVie recently received an information request from the FDA for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for its upadacitinib in psoriatic arthritis. AbbVie responded to the request and the FDA will require additional time for a full review of the submission.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli wrote that peak yearly sales hopes of $8 billion for Rinvoq would be &ldquo;severely hampered&rdquo; if the medicine gets a strict warning for the threat of blood clots as has Pfizer&rsquo;s (NYSE: PFE) Xeljanz (tofacitinib).

<p>Bronchitol is the first and only dry powder inhaled mucoactive agent providing a compact, portable option for patients that was approved in this formulation by the US Food and Drug Administration in November last year.</p>
<p>Additionally, data from the global Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of inhaled dry powder mannitol in adults with CF has been published online in the <a href=""https://www.cysticfibrosisjournal.com/article/S1569-1993(21)00046-1/fulltext"">Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</a>. In the multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study of 423 adults with CF, subjects received either mannitol 400mg or mannitol 50mg (control), twice-daily via dry powder inhaler for 26 weeks. Authors concluded that mannitol 400mg inhaled twice-daily via a dry powder inhaler statistically significantly improved lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) compared with control, with this improvement supported by sensitivity analyses. Most common adverse reactions (&ge;3%) include cough, hemoptysis, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, bacteria sputum identified, pyrexia and arthralgia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiesi USA has a longstanding commitment to advancing treatments and patient care programs among the CF community, and we are thrilled to add Bronchitol to our comprehensive offering,&rdquo; said Jon Zwinski, general manager and chief executive of Chiesi USA. &ldquo;We are excited to bring the first dry powder inhaled mucoactive agent to the US for adults with CF, delivered by a portable device that doesn&rsquo;t require routine maintenance or cleaning,&rdquo; he noted.</p>

<p>Prof Pierluigi Nicotera, chairman of the DZNE&rsquo;s executive board, commented: &ldquo;We are pleased to have formed this collaboration with Eisai, which has an outstanding track record and a company-wide commitment to providing innovative treatments in the neurodegenerative disorders field. We think that this collaboration will be able to accelerate creation of new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, including those for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s. The DZNE will contribute knowledge and technical expertise in studying disease processes combined with our translational, patient-oriented approach that involves close interaction between fundamental and clinical research.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Teiji Kimura, vice president, chief discovery officer of the Eisai Neurology Business Group, commented: &ldquo;Neurodegenerative diseases including AD comprise a disease area with high unmet medical needs. DZNE has many world-leading scientists in this field and we expect to create new disease-modifying therapies for those suffering from neurodegenerative disorders by conducting research for immune and metabolic incompetence in neurons and glia cells.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-17 14:00:00","Eisai inks Alzheimer’s collaboration with DZNE","Eisai, Collaboration, DZNE, Neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's","Eisai inks Alzheimer’s collaboration with DZNE",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-17 13:58:27","2021-03-17 14:08:44",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eisai-inks-alzheimer-s-collaboration-with-dzne,,,,,,eisaibig.jpg,eisaismall.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Deals, Research","Germany, Japan",Eisai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488063,,"Vaccitech completes $168 million financing","UK-based Vaccitech said today it has raised $168 million in a Series B financing. This includes $43 million in convertible loan notes previously issued by Vaccitech that converted into Series B shares.","<p>UK-based Vaccitech said today it has raised $168 million in a Series B financing. This includes $43 million in convertible loan notes previously issued by Vaccitech that converted into Series B shares.</p>
<p>The Series B financing round was led by M&amp;G Investment Management (part of M&amp;G plc), with further participation from new investors including Tencent, Gilead Sciences, Monaco Constitutional Reserve Fund, and Future Planet Capital among others. The Series B financing round was also supported by existing investors, including Oxford Sciences Innovation.</p>
<p>Vaccitech, an Oxford University spin-out, was instrumental in the development of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, earlier dubbed AZD1222. AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) gained rights to the vaccine, which has been approved for the pandemic in the European Union, UK and many other countries, and has already been used in dozens of millions of patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect this financing to enable us to reach key value inflection points for our lead programs,&rdquo; said Bill Enright, chief executive of Vaccitech, adding: &ldquo;We now look forward to advancing key programs towards generating proof-of-concept data in indications with significant need of effective new treatments.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Use of the proceeds</strong></h2>
<p>The proceeds from the financing will support the continued development of three infectious disease and immuno-oncology programs. The programs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Phase I/II clinical trial of VTP-300 in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The first patient in the trial was dosed in February 2021.</li>
<li>A Phase I/II clinical trial of VTP-200 in patients with persistent, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.</li>
<li>A Phase I/II clinical trial of VTP-850 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in patients with prostate cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccitech&rsquo;s proprietary prime-boost platform combines modified simian adenoviral vectors (known as ChAdOx1 or ChAdOx2) to prime a targeted immune response with the Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA) to boost the targeted immune response against cells infected with a virus or tumor cells. Vaccitech&rsquo;s heterologous prime-boost approach has been demonstrated to drive powerful immune responses, including the leading CD8+ T cell stimulation profile in humans, to date.</p>
<p>In addition to the HBV, HPV and prostate cancer programs, Vaccitech&rsquo;s pipeline includes product candidates targeting infectious disease (including MERS coronavirus and Herpes Zoster) and cancer (including non-small cell lung cancer).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaccitech is aiming to address serious global public health challenges in both infectious disease and cancer with their T cell inducing immunotherapy platform,&rdquo; said Jack Daniels, chief investment officer of M&amp;G, adding: &ldquo;We believe their innovative approach, based on foundational research performed at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, could provide a solution for many serious diseases,&rdquo; he noted.0</p>","2021-03-17 11:32:00","UK-based Vaccitech said today it has raised $168 million in a Series B","Vaccitech, Financing, Series B, Research, Hepatitis B, HPV, Cancer, Prostate","UK-based Vaccitech said today it has raised $168 million in a Series B financing.

<p>Initiated by the FTC, the working group will include the Canadian Competition Bureau, the European Commission Directorate General for Competition, the UK&rsquo;s Competition and Markets Authority, the US Department of Justice Antitrust Division, and Offices of State Attorneys General.</p>
<p>This joint project taps expertise from competition authorities with whom the FTC cooperates frequently, as well as others with relevant experience, to ensure the most effective enforcement in these crucial markets. The goal of this initiative is to identify concrete and actionable steps to review and update the analysis of pharmaceutical mergers. This project will ensure that FTC investigations include fresh approaches that fully analyze and address the varied competitive concerns that these mergers and acquisitions raise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the high volume of pharmaceutical mergers in recent years, amid skyrocketing drug prices and ongoing concerns about anticompetitive conduct in the industry, it is imperative that we rethink our approach toward pharmaceutical merger review,&rdquo; said FTC Acting Chairperson Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. &ldquo;Working hand in hand with international and domestic enforcement partners, we intend to take an aggressive approach to tackling anticompetitive pharmaceutical mergers,&rdquo; she noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Among the questions to be considered:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>How can current theories of harm be expanded and refreshed?</li>
<li>What is the full range of a pharmaceutical merger&rsquo;s effects on innovation?</li>
<li>In merger review, how should we consider pharmaceutical conduct such as price fixing, reverse payments, and other regulatory abuses?</li>
<li>What evidence would be needed to challenge a transaction based on any new or expanded theories of harm?</li>
<li>What types of remedies would work in the cases to which those theories are applied?</li>
<li>What have we learned about the scope of assets and characteristics of firms that make successful divestiture buyers?</li>

<p>In the study of 159 patients, bintrafusp alfa demonstrated single-agent efficacy and durability with a manageable safety profile after more than nine months of follow-up, with an Independent Review Committee (IRC)-adjudicated objective response rate (ORR) of 10.1% (95% CI: 5.9% to 15.8%) per RECIST 1.1.</p>
<h2><strong>Did not meet pre-defined threshold</strong></h2>
<p>Though single-agent activity was observed, the study did not meet the pre-defined threshold that would have enabled regulatory filing for BTC in the second line setting. The results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting or publication.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly given the development, Merck&rsquo;s shares closed up 2.7% at 137.60 euros today.</p>
<p>Bintrafusp alfa (M7824), discovered in-house at Merck, is in clinical development through a strategic <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/germany-s-merck-enters-mega-billion-dollar-cancer-deal-with-gsk"">alliance with GlaxoSmithKline</a> (LSE: GSK), under which the UK pharma major pledged as much as $4.23 billion to the German firm.</p>
<p>In January, Merck also reported a Phase III setback in non-small cell lung cancer, leading the company to discontinue that program. Those results cast doubt on the future of the drug, and also meant that Merck is set to miss out on some hefty &ldquo;biobucks&rdquo; milestone payments due from GSK under the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the high unmet treatment need in BTC, where single agent immunotherapy in PD-L1 all comers has shown an ORR of 5.8%, we are encouraged by the single agent clinical activity of bintrafusp alfa in this study as a second-line treatment,&rdquo; said Dr Milind Javle, professor of GI medical oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and an investigator for the INTR@PID BTC 047 study. &ldquo;The bintrafusp alfa 047 study is one of the most important clinical investigations conducted for chemo-refractory biliary cancers, and I would like to thank the patients, families, and study team for their valuable participation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study demonstrates single-agent activity with bintrafusp alfa in locally advanced or metastatic BTC, a disease that has been historically difficult to treat,&rdquo; said Dr Danny Bar-Zohar, global head of development for the Healthcare business sector of Merck, adding; &ldquo;The data will contribute to our understanding of addressing both TGF-&beta; and PD-L1 inhibition in the tumor microenvironment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Phase II/III study of bintrafusp alfa in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for BTC (INTR@PID BTC 055), which is assessing a different hypothesis than the second-line monotherapy study, has completed enrollment in the Phase II portion and is currently ongoing, said Merck.</p>","2021-03-16 15:59:00","Merck takes another hit on bintrafusp alfa development","Merck KGaA, Bintrafusp alfa, Phase II, Cancer, Biliary tract, BTC, GlaxoSmithKline","Merck takes another hit on bintrafusp alfa development",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-16 15:58:40","2021-03-16 16:08:23",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-takes-another-hit-on-bintrafusp-alfa-development,,,,,,merck_kgaa_new_large.jpg,merck_kgaa_new_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,Oncology,"Drug Trial, Research","Germany, UK","GlaxoSmithKline, Merck KGaA","bintrafusp alpha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Japanese pharma major Takeda Pharmaceutical (TYO: 4502) presented the data during a Presidential Symposium at the annual meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).</p>
<p>Results from a subgroup analysis show greater than three times as many (62.8%) transplant recipients in the test group achieved clearance after eight weeks, compared with those who received investigator assigned treatment.</p>
<p>Transplant recipients in the subgroup receiving maribavir exhibited lower incidence of treatment-related toxicities common with conventional antiviral therapies, Takeda said.</p>
<p>Overall, 67% of those treated with maribavir experienced side effects, and serious adverse events including diarrhea and renal failure were much more common in this group, compared with those given Valcyte (valganciclovir).</p>
<p>However, given the severity of the condition and the lack of alternatives, regulators will likely not consider that an impediment to approval.</p>
<h2>Maribavir development</h2>
<p>The CMV virus is very widespread, and is normally safely controlled by a healthy immune system. For those who receive a transplant, immunosuppressants can result in a flare up of the virus, leading to serious disease.</p>
<p>Maribavir, an orphan drug-designated antiviral agent, is currently the only investigational therapy in development for this patient population.</p>
<p>Originally part of ViroPharma&rsquo;s pipeline, the therapy was picked up by Shire, and subsequently by Takeda via its $64 billion acquisition of the rare disease specialist.</p>
<p>The detailed results build on previously released top-line data showing the SOLSTICE trial met its primary efficacy endpoint.</p>
<p>Rafael Duarte, of Madrid-based Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, said: &ldquo;Transplant recipients with CMV infections resistant to conventional antiviral therapies are some of the hardest to treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;We believe these data are important as they build on previously presented results supporting the potential of maribavir, which, if approved, could transform the management of CMV in these patients.""</p>","2021-03-16 12:38:00",,"maribavir, results, disease, treatment, trial, SOLSTICE, transplant, candidate, orphan, drug, Japan, blossoms, generated, positive, TAK-, Phase, viremia","A novel treatment for the viral disease CMV viremia, TAK-620 (maribavir), has generated positive results in the Phase III SOLSTICE trial.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-16 11:57:16","2021-03-16 17:31:12",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/orphan-drug-candidate-blossoms-in-japan,,,,,,2020_biotech_lab_vials_big.jpg,2020_biotech_lab_vials_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Anti-virals, Infectious diseases","Conferences, Drug Trial, Research",Japan,Takeda,maribavir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Outside of Japan, Perception is developing PCN-101 for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression.&nbsp;Atai acquired a majority stake in Perception in 2019.</p>
<p>PCN-101 is a formulation of R-ketamine, a single isomer of ketamine that belongs to a new generation of glutamate receptor modulators, being developed as a rapid acting antidepressant (RAAD). In non-clinical depression models it possessed more durable and potent effects than S-ketamine, and potentially a more favorable safety and tolerability profile. A Phase I, single ascending dose study has been completed for PCN-101 and a Phase II proof-of-concept study in TRD is planned to be initiated by Perception in the first half of 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Terms of the deal</strong></h2>
<p>Under the terms of the license, Otsuka will have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products containing PCN-101 in Japan. Otsuka will undertake development, regulatory, and commercialization activities in Japan, with input and guidance from both companies. Perception will receive an upfront payment of $20 million, which will help fund the company&rsquo;s overall development of treatments. In addition, Perception will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered, double-digit royalties on future sales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otsuka is one of the world&rsquo;s premier pharmaceutical companies in the neuropsychiatric space.&rdquo; said Terence Kelly, chief executive of Perception, adding: &ldquo;To have such a strong collaborator at this early stage of development is a significant vote of confidence in the potential of PCN-101 for patients suffering from depression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Swiss cancer giant is testing the SMN2 splicing modifier as an option for people with Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 SMA.</p>
<p>The data suggests that gains in motor function after the first year are sustained for another 12 months, across primary and secondary endpoint measures.</p>
<p>These results add to recently published data from the FIREFISH trial, which showed that treatment with Evrysdi almost doubled levels of the SMN protein for the high-dose group.</p>
<p>Details from the SUNFISH study will be presented at the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Virtual Clinical &amp; Scientific Conference.</p>
<h2>More choice in SMA</h2>
<p>Marketed in the USA by Roche subsidiary Genentech, Evrysdi is the first at-home, orally administered treatment for SMA in adults and children over the age of two.</p>
<p>The treatment, which has been developed in collaboration with PTC Therapeutics (Nasdaq: PTCT) and the SMA Foundation, is expected to provide stiff competition for other options with a less patient-friendly mode of administration.</p>
<p>Rivals include Biogen&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BIIB) Spinraza (nusinersen) and Novartis&rsquo; (NOVN: V) Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec).</p>
<p>First approved in 2020, the therapy took in 55 million Swiss francs ($59 million) sales last year. Analysts have forecast peak sales potential of up to $2 billion.</p>
<p>Commenting on the most recent data, principal investigator Eugenio Mercuri said: &ldquo;These results build on the one-year findings from the SUNFISH trial and importantly show the durability of improvement or stabilization of motor function through two years of treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;In addition, with no new safety signals identified, these second year results may support the favorable benefit-risk profile of Evrysdi over a longer period of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) builds on an <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astrazeneca-bags-486-million-us-govt-award-for-its-covid-19-candidate"">agreement last October</a> for the support of the late-stage development of AZD7442 and for the supply of an initial 100,000 doses of the LAAB combination. It included the option to acquire additional doses in 2021. The company also has a separate agreement to supply the DoD with 100,000 doses, bringing potential US supplies of AZD7442 to 700,000 in 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial terms</strong></h2>
<p>The value of the extended agreement is $205 million and is contingent on AZD7442 receiving Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization in post-exposure prophylaxis - the ability to prevent COVID-19 in people who have confirmed exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p>Together, the total value of current agreements with the US government for the development and supply of AZD7442 in 2021 is about $726 million. The extended agreement is not anticipated to impact the company's financial guidance for 2021.</p>
<p>The news comes amid concerns that the Anglo-Swedish pharma major&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is linked to a small number of blood clots in people who have received the jab, though the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency the UK regulator have strongly supported its safety.</p>
<h2><strong>Potential to offer almost immediate protection</strong></h2>
<p>Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;The long-acting antibody combination has the potential to offer almost immediate protection to those who are not able to be vaccinated, to both prevent infection or treat the disease in patients already infected with the virus. The US government&rsquo;s support is critical in helping accelerate the development of AZD7442, which we believe will be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19<em>.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>AZD7442 is currently being evaluated for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in late-stage trials in more than 9,000 participants around the world. The two-LAAB combination has been engineered with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s proprietary half-life extension technology which triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies.

<p>The new strategy will be known as ""Pharma-2030,"" while among its priorities will be the increase of production of active ingredients and innovative drugs within the country as well as introduction of the drug insurance system in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new strategy should replace the previous one, dubbed &ldquo;Pharma-2020&rdquo;, which provided an opportunity to the Russian pharmaceutical industry to enter into a new stage of its development, although has not resulted in the solution of the majority of it most pressing problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Focus on development of biological and pathogenetic drugs</strong></h2>
<p>In the meantime, according to Alexander Petrov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Health Protection, the new strategy will pay more attention for the development of biological and pathogenetic drugs.</p>
<p>According to him, Russian patients need innovative medicines, but so far their production within the country has been limited. It is planned, the new strategy will create conditions for their more active production within the territory of the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to production, there are also plans to continue procurement of these pathogenetic drugs, particularly those that are primarily recommended to treat orphan diseases and that these will primarily be purchased by the recently-established Circle of Kindness state foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Stanislav Naumov, chairman of the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of the Eurasian Economic Union, it is also important to continue the development of the domestic production of active ingredients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Naumov comments: &ldquo;The pandemic, which led to disruptions in the supply of active ingredients from China, has confirmed the importance of the full localization of all pharmaceutical production cycles at the national level. At present, only 10% of drugs available in the Russian market are made from Russian ingredients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Need for new insurance system</strong></h2>
<p>In the meantime, according to Lilia Titova, head of the Russian Union of Professional Pharmaceutical Organizations, a new state strategy should also ensure a more active development of a system of drug insurance in Russia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilot projects for certain groups of patients in this area have existed for many years, but now, thanks to the introduction of electronic prescriptions, it has become possible to extend them to the entire population,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts believe the existing presidential fund alone is not enough to help orphan patients, there is also a need reconsider the methods of procurements in Russia and to abandon public procurement procedures under Federal Law-44, given a priority to offset contracts.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to them, there is also a need to introduce the practice of risk-sharing, when the state pays the full cost of drugs only if their use really improved the patient's health.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-16 10:20:00","Russia plans new strategy for pharmaceutical sector until 2030","Russia, Government, Strategy, Innovation, Production, Insurance, Pharma 2030","Russia plans new strategy for pharmaceutical sector until 2030",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-15 18:31:37","2021-03-16 10:20:20",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-plans-new-strategy-for-pharmaceutical-sector-until-2030,,,,,,russia_moscow_large-1-.jpg,russia_moscow_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Rare diseases","Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Production, Research, Russian market",Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The trials will be conducted by a joint venture established between Biocad and China's Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding under the name of SPH Biocad.</p>
<p>Intended for the treatment of melanoma, Biocad has been developing Forteka since 2013 and, according to Russian Vedomosti business paper, the company has already invested 737.2 million roubles (~$10 million) in its development.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Ownership and investment in the JV</strong></h2>
<p>The SPH Biocad joint venture was established two years ago with a capitalization of $400 million. Of this amount, $200.4 was invested by Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding, which received a 50.1% stake in the JV. The remaining stake is owned by Biocad, which contributed $29.94 million to the venture.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, the Russian company also obtained permanent and exclusive rights on the production and distribution of six drugs for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases (prolgolimab, netakimab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, adalimumab, anti-GITR MAb).&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a representative of Biocad, the beginning of the trials is scheduled for second-quarter 2021, with planned investments amounting to $35 million. This is the first drug developed by the Russian company for which clinical trials will be conducted in China. The drug is currently being researched in Europe (Hungary and Slovakia), where volunteers are being recruited.</p>
<p>In the event of successful tests, the production of the drug could be launched within the territory of China. Planned production volumes as well as estimated sales of the drug are not disclosed and will mainly depend on the level of demand in the local market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AVEO will regain rights to AV-203 in all territories outside of North America, and CANbridge has initiated the process to transfer all pre-clinical data and materials to AVEO. The transfer of rights and termination of the collaboration and license agreement will become effective on September 5, 2021.</p>
<p>To date, AVEO has completed a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of AV-203 in patients with advanced solid tumors (N=22). In this study, one patient had a dose limiting adverse event and the recommended Phase II dose, or RP2D, is 20mg/kg. One of two neuregulin positive (NRG1+) patients had a partial response. Neuregulin, the only known ligand for ErbB3, is a potential biomarker which may prove to be predictive of AV-203 anti-tumor activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

488039,,"High tumor mutation burden only predicts when immunotherapy will work in certain cancers","A new study led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has shed some light on the matter of predicting when immunotherapies will work in cancer.","<p>A new study led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has shed some light on the matter of predicting when immunotherapies will work in cancer.</p>
<p>The study shows that a high rate of genetic mutations within a tumor, known as high tumor mutation burden (TMB), is only useful for predicting clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in a subset of cancer types.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Our results do not support applying high TMB status as a universal biomarker for immunotherapy response""</span></p>
<p>These findings, published in Annals of Oncology, suggest that TMB status may not be reliably used as a universal biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response.</p>
<p>While TMB status is capable of successfully predicting response to checkpoint blockade in certain cancers, such as melanoma, lung and bladder cancer, there is no association with improved outcomes in others, including breast, prostate and brain cancers.</p>
<p>Lead author Daniel McGrail, post-doctoral fellow in Systems Biology, said: &ldquo;This study represents the most comprehensive analysis to date of TMB as a biomarker for response to immune checkpoint blockade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our results do not support applying high TMB status as a universal biomarker for immunotherapy response, suggesting that additional tumor type-specific studies are needed to clarify how best to apply TMB status in cancer types where it does not appear to be associated with outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene mutations within a tumor lead to the production of mutant proteins, or neoantigens, which can be recognized as abnormal by the immune system. It follows that a high TMB would render tumors more immunogenic, which is why TMB status has become a leading candidate biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response, Dr McGrail explained.</p>
<h2>Keytruda case study</h2>
<p>In June 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for treating patients with advanced and refractory cancers with a high TMB, as indicated by a defined threshold level of mutations. The approval was based on results from the Phase II KEYNOTE-158 study, which found improved overall responses in patients with a high TMB. However, the trial did not include several cancer types, such as breast, prostate and brain cancers, which have not typically responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.</p>
<p>Senior author Shiaw-Yih Lin, professor of systems biology, said: &ldquo;The FDA approval of pembrolizumab for patients with high TMB certainly provides an important option for many patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we felt that it was important to look more closely at TMB status in a broader group of cancer types and establish approaches to harmonize TMB across various assays to enable clinicians to best utilize the recent FDA approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed over 10,000 tumors across 31 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas to study the relationship between TMB status and tumor immunogenicity, measured by the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor. They identified two classes of tumors &ndash; those with and without a strong correlation between TMB status and T cell infiltration.</p>
<h2>'Not&nbsp;generalizable across all cancers'</h2>
<p>The authors predicted that TMB status would not be able to predict immunotherapy response equally in these two groups. They evaluated this using previously published studies and MD Anderson patient cohorts.</p>
<p>For cancers with a strong correlation between TMB status and T cell infiltration, patients with a high TMB had improved clinical outcomes. Across all cancer types in this category, patients with a high TMB had a 39.8% overall response rate to checkpoint inhibitors, which was significantly higher than those with a low TMB.</p>
<p>In contrast, TMB status was not predictive of outcome in the second class of tumors. Within this category, patients with a high TMB had a 15.3% overall response rate, which was actually lower than the response rate for patients with low TMB.</p>
<p>Dr McGrail added: &ldquo;While TMB status does show value in predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade in several cancer types, this was not generalizable across all cancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those cancer types where a high TMB does not appear to increase immunogenicity, additional prospective studies are needed to determine if TMB status can be an effective clinical biomarker and at what threshold.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-15 13:50:00",,"cancer, high, status, response, cancers, tumor, predicting, study, immunotherapy, types, biomarker, patients, immune, work, checkpoint, universal, results","A new study led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has shed some light on the matter of predicting when immunotherapies will ",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-15 12:33:05","2021-03-15 13:53:23",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/high-tumor-mutation-burden-only-predicts-when-immunotherapy-will-work-in-certain-cancers,,,,,,immunotherapy-big.jpg,immunotherapy-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Immuno-oncology, Oncology","Health Medical Pharma, Research",USA,"Merck & Co",Keytruda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The first clinical studies of the oral combination are expected to begin in the second half of 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will work as partners, sharing operational responsibilities, as well as development, commercialization and marketing costs, and any future revenues.</p>
<p>Merck and Gilead seek to build on their legacies of transforming HIV care by focusing on long-acting therapies, which may represent a meaningful innovation in HIV drug development. While daily, single tablet regimens are available for people living with HIV, options that would allow for less frequent, oral dosing or infrequent injections rather than daily dosing have the potential to address preference considerations, as well as issues associated with adherence and privacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Long-acting therapies may provide additional options</strong></h2>
<p>As the field of HIV treatment evolves, long-acting therapies may provide additional options for people living with HIV and their physicians that will help continue to put the needs of individuals at the center of their own care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Merck, we are resolute in our commitment to advancing the care of people living with HIV as part of our mission to save and improve lives,&rdquo; said Kenneth Frazier, chairman and chief executive of Merck, adding: &ldquo;This collaboration with Gilead brings together two companies dedicated to the fight against HIV to develop potential new long-acting treatment options, and is an important step forward in our strategy to harness the full potential of islatravir for the treatment of HIV.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><strong>India: new battleground</strong></h2>
<p>Union Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan recently noted that, with some bold initiatives, the cost of cancer drugs and cancer care could be managed in such a way to improve outcomes for patients through greater accessibility and affordability of drugs and still allow for continued pharmaceutical innovation.</p>
<p>Dr Vardhan was speaking at the launch of the upcoming second campus of the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology (RGCB) at Akkulam in Thiruvananthapuram. The campus is to be developed as a major facility on translational applications of immunotherapy and development of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of cancer.</p>
<p>Dr Vardhan said RGCB&rsquo;s close association with multiple cancer hospitals in Kerala is a good model that is expected to facilitate the advanced cell-based therapy against cancer at affordable costs to needy patients.</p>
<p>A lead anticancer molecule discovered by RGCB team has been licensed to a multinational company and is in the final stages of preclinical testing at Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, USA.</p>
<h2><strong>Home front</strong></h2>
<p>Shares of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE AZN) Indian unit gained nearly 2% in opening deals on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday after the drugmaker received import and market permission from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for osimertinib tablets (Tagrisso) used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Osimertinib tablets as monotherapy is now approved for additional indication for the adjuvant treatment after complete tumor resection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations,"" the company said.</p>
<p>The approval paves the way for the launch of osimertinib tablets into a new disease area in India. Last October, AstraZeneca Pharma India launched its acalabrutinib 100mg capsules, used for the treatment of various types of blood cancers, under the brand name Calquence in the country.</p>
<p>India's Natco Pharma (BSE: 524816) announced that its marketing partner, Breckenridge Pharmaceutical (BPI), received final approval for its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for everolimus tablets (a generic version of Afinitor) from the US Food and Drug Administration. BPI plans to launch 2.5mg, 5mg and 7.5mg strengths of the product shortly.</p>
<p>As per industry sales data, cancer drug Afinitor and its therapeutic equivalents generated annual sales of $712 million in USA during the 12 months ending December 2020.</p>
<p>While Natco aims to launch around 10 new products every year in the Indian market, Shilpa Medicare has launched sunitinib capsules, under the brand name Sunishil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunitinib is a novel oral multi targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumour and antiangiogenic activities. Sunitinib capsules are indicated for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib, advanced renal cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Shilpa Medicare's sunitinib capsules has been proven to be bioequivalent to international brand Sutent capsules of Pfizer.</p>
<p>Bengaluru-based Biocon recently announced a partnership with international organizations to enhance access to its life-saving cancer medicines in lower and middle-income countries. With this, the Indian company, has joined the list of companies, including Novartis, Pfizer, and Viatris, which distribute its drugs at subsidized prices and increase their access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the partnership, Biocon Biologics aims to enhance access to lifesaving cancer therapies, including biologic trastuzumab and biologic pegfilgrastim. The expanded partnership is to make 26 medicines in 39 formulations affordably available to low- and middle-income countries across Africa and Asia, including key chemotherapies, hormonal therapies, biologics, and supportive therapies essential for the treatment of 30 cancers, including breast cancer.</p>
<p>Last October, Lupin (BSE: 500257) launched lapatinib tablets, for advanced or metastatic breast cancer, in the US market. The company launched the tablets after its alliance partner Natco Pharma received final approval for its ANDA from the US FDA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product is a generic version of Novartis&rsquo; Tykerb tablets. According to IQVIA MAT June 2020 data, lapatinib tablets had annual sales of approximately $61 million in the US.</p>
<h2><strong>Generic drugs</strong></h2>
<p>According to GlobalData, 1,351 generic drugs are available in India for the treatment of different cancers, as of 26 February 2021. The approval of several generic versions of sunitinib to treat kidney cancer by the CDSCO is a case in point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (BSE: 532296) recently launched Sutib, the generic version of sunitinib oral capsules to treat kidney cancer in India, generic companies Beta Drugs also launched sunitinib generic with brand name Adsunib. Other companies with sunitinib generics include Globela Pharma and SP Accure Labs.</p>
<p>In 2020, Zydus Cadila (BOM: 532321) launched a generic brand of enzalutamide Obnyx for prostate cancer, reducing the monthly treatment cost by 70%. Several other companies too had launched enzalutamide generics in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the launch of dasatinib generics reduced the monthly treatment cost for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by more than 96% compared to originator brand drug cost.</p>

<p>Presented at the 15th International Conference on Alzheimer's &amp; Parkinson Diseases held virtually March 9-14, and published simultaneously in the <em><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3096138-1&amp;h=4208572759&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2100708&amp;a=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine"">New England Journal of Medicine</a></em> (NEJM), results from the Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study expand on previously reported top-line data that found donanemab met its primary endpoint and showed significant slowing of decline on the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), a composite measure of cognition and daily function, in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease compared to placebo<sup style=""font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"">.</sup></p>
<p>Additionally, data from secondary analyses showed donanemab consistently slowed cognitive and functional decline, with ranges between 20%-40% in all secondary endpoints [Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog13), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)] with nominal statistical significance at multiple times compared to placebo. Further, prespecified exploratory analyses showed donanemab slowed the accumulation of tau across key brain regions in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Donanemab has &ldquo;potential to become a very important treatment&rdquo; in AD</strong></h2>
<p>""We are confident in the results of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study,"" said Dr Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, adding: ""This is the first late-stage study in Alzheimer's disease to meet its primary endpoint at the primary analysis. Donanemab has the potential to become a very important treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We were pleased to see not only slowing of cognitive and functional decline, but also very substantial clearance of amyloid plaques and slowing of spread of tau pathology. The constellation of clinical and biomarker results indicates the potential for long-term disease modification. We are grateful to the patients, caregivers, and investigators who participated in this landmark study.""</p>
<h2><strong>Longer and larger trials necessary</strong></h2>
<p>In patients with early Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. However, longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, concluded the authors of the study in the NEJM, noting that it still failed to meet the pre-stated objective of showing a 50% reduction in trial participants&rsquo; cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Specifically, at 76 weeks compared to baseline, treatment with donanemab slowed decline by 32% compared to placebo as measured by the iADRS, which was statistically significant. As early as nine months (36 weeks) after initiation of treatment, a significant difference in decline by iADRS was observed.</p>
<p>In addition, 40% of participants treated with donanemab achieved amyloid negativity as early as six months after starting treatment and 68% achieved this target by 18 months. Donanemab is a monoclonal antibody that was designed to bind a specific form of post-translationally modified A&szlig;, N-terminal pyroglutamate, and thereby yield rapid and complete clearance of amyloid plaques.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""As a clinician and researcher, I'm particularly encouraged by the significant plaque lowering and the slowing of clinical decline with donanemab,"" said Dr Stephen Salloway, director of the Memory and Aging Program and the Department of Neurology at Butler Hospital and Martin M Zucker professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, quoted by Lilly. ""The donanemab results are a significant and encouraging milestone for people impacted by Alzheimer's disease and we are eager to continue on in this fight,"" he noted.</p>

<p>The Swedish firm is seeking an Accelerated Approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the novel formulation, which targets down regulation of IgA, and plans to submit for European marketing authorization imminently.</p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency has indicated that it would be open to reviewing a submission under the similar Conditional Marketing Authorization scheme, based on the firm&rsquo;s trial program.</p>
<p>Calliditas is seeking approval based on positive data from the Phase III NefIgArd trial, announced late last year, which showed a statistically-significant reduction in proteinuria compared with placebo.</p>
<p>Subject to regulatory approval, Calliditas plans to commercialize the product by itself in the USA, and through collaborations in other regions.</p>
<h2>Nefecon development</h2>
<p>With no currently-approved drugs for IgAN, the Swedish firm is well-placed to fill a significant unmet clinical need, particularly as new clinical endpoints have shortened lead times for development.</p>
<p>Around half of people with IgAN - up to 200,000 in the USA and Europe - are at risk of disease progression, which can lead to the highly burdensome treatments of dialysis and transplantation.</p>

<p>Last week, news related to COVID-19 included US pharma giant Merck &amp; Co and biotech partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics releasing encouraging mid-stage data on molnupiravir, their antiviral treatment. Producing negative news, CytoDyn reported Phase III data on its COVID-10 candidate Vyrologix (leronlimab) in COVID-19. Elsewhere, US biotech bluebird bio released new analyses relating to LentiGlobin in cell therapy programs that the US Food and Drug Administration put on clinical hold due to a possible link with a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Also of note, after a long wait, AVEO Oncology last Wednesday finally gained FDA approval for its bladder cancer drug Fotivda (tivozanib).</p>
<h2><strong>Molnupiravir&rsquo;s big day draws near</strong></h2>
<p>The recent failures of several potential COVID-19 therapies has reminded the world that, while vaccine development has gone remarkably smoothly so far, agents to treat the virus are still few and far between, commented Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>Merck &amp; Co and Ridgeback will hope to change this with their <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/preliminary-phase-iia-trial-results-of-molnupiravir-in-covid-19"">oral antiviral molnupiravir</a>, and it should not be long before it becomes apparent whether the project has a future: interim Phase II/III data are expected this quarter, in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients alike.</p>
<p>The companies did present some results last Saturday, but these were from a Phase IIa study in non-hospitalized patients that primarily measured virologic efficacy &ndash; and, in a move that raised eyebrows, the groups only reported data on a secondary endpoint, time to viral negativity determined via isolation in Vero cell line culture.</p>
<p>However, Leerink analysts raised several questions, including the nature of three adverse events that led to drug discontinuations. Merck and Ridgeback said that, although the study remained blinded, none of the four serious adverse events seen in the trial were deemed related to molnupiravir.</p>
<p>Separately, Evercore ISI&rsquo;s Umer Raffat noted that some virologists had expressed concerns about molnupiravir&rsquo;s mutagenic mechanism. Merck and Ridgeback also said on Saturday that animal studies, in which the project was given for longer and at higher doses than in human trials, suggested that molnupiravir was not mutagenic or genotoxic.</p>
<p>Another big question, noted Ms Armstrong, is whether the latest data will translate into a benefit on harder endpoints such as reductions in hospitalizations and death. This is exactly what Merck&rsquo;s upcoming trials, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04575584"">MK-4482-001</a>&nbsp;in the hospital setting and <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04575597"">MK-4482-002</a>&nbsp;in the outpatient setting, are looking to show.</p>
<p>In hospitalized patients the bar for molnupiravir, albeit not a very high one, has been set by Gilead&rsquo;s intravenous antiviral Veklury, which is FDA-approved despite fairly unimpressive results, she said.</p>
<h2><strong>CytoDyn tries to squeeze positive news out of a failed Covid-19 study</strong></h2>
<p>CytoDyn really, really wanted to put its best foot forward, said Amber Tong on Endpoints News. So much so that, after sitting on unblinded <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-iii-trial-for-leronlimab-in-covid-19-patients-disappoints"">Phase IIb/III data on Vyrologix</a> (leronlimab) in Covid-19 for two weeks pending regulatory discussions, the biotech issued six press releases over the weekend, each offering a little more information or refining what was previously disclosed.</p>
<p>In one of them, CytoDyn acknowledged that leronlimab - an anti-CCR5 antibody that had already been turned away at the FDA&rsquo;s doorsteps once - had failed the primary endpoint of lowering all-cause mortality at Day 28, as the result was not statistically significant. At best, execs implied, they would need to collect further clinical data to be ready for regulatory reviews.</p>
<p>Further massaging the data, execs pointed out that there were more over-65 patients taking leronlimab than placebo &mdash; leading them to conduct a post hoc &ldquo;age adjustment&rdquo; analysis and deduce &ldquo;statistically-significant results (p-value = 0.0319)&rdquo; for the primary endpoint &ldquo;in participants receiving leronlimab + &lsquo;commonly used COVID-19 treatments&rsquo; compared to participants who received &lsquo;commonly used COVID-19 treatments&rsquo; alone in the placebo group in the overall modified intent-to-treat (&lsquo;mITT&rsquo;) population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CytoDyn claimed it&rsquo;s gotten regulators on board with the subgroup hypothesis: The UK&rsquo;s MHRA is apparently willing to accept data from the open-label extension of the study, which has enrolled 45 so far. The US agency is asking for data from 140 more patients in the critically ill population, with the new primary endpoint of length of hospital stay (according to CytoDyn, leronlimab had shortened time to recovery by six days among these patients compared to placebo plus standard of care only, with a p-value of 0.005). In Canada, the company will apply to start selling the drug while clinical trials continue &mdash; with unclear prospects.</p>
<h2><strong>bluebird bio: Lenti partial exoneration incrementally positive, but not thesis&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>RBC Analyst Luca Issi on Wednesday released a client note on bluebird bio in reaction to the biotech company&rsquo;s new analyses that it was very unlikely its gene therapy had a link with a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bluebird-bio-says-very-unlikely-aml-events-are-linked-to-its-gene-therapy"">case of acute myeloid leukemia</a> (AML) in a clinical trial patient.</p>
<p><u>Changing Impact:</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incrementally Positive - We think the update on the two new cases of AML/MDS is incrementally positive given no obvious evidence of insertional oncogenesis, but we remain on the side-lines as we still see an uphill battle with the regulators and commercial adoption.</p>
<p><u>AML Case Unlikely Caused By Lenti, MDS Case Still Under Investigation - </u>Findings shared today suggest it is unlikely that lenti played a role in the AML case, as the site of integration occurred within an intron (non-coding region) of a gene not associated with oncogenesis (VAMP4). The second case of MDS is still under investigation as it is unclear whether the clinical findings (prolonged anemia/trisomy of 8) meet the criteria of MDS given no blast/dysplastic cells observed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Lenti Exoneration Incrementally Positive, But We Still See Uphill Battle</u> - We think the update is incrementally positive as it clears lenti from direct causation at least in one of the two new cases. However, we remain on the side-lines given we see an uphill battle with the regulators (we have 3 cases of AML/MDS out of 44 patients, substantially higher than what historical literature would suggest for SCD patients link1, link2) and commercial adoption (our KOL thinks he will use gene therapy in 3-5% of patients if ultimately approved vs the 5-10% he envisioned before the setback, link).</p>
<p>Adding his voice, Evaluate Vantage&rsquo;s Jacob Plieth said bluebird had largely ruled out the role of its lentivirus in an AML case that has caused LentiGlobin sickle cell trials to be halted, but there was another vital snippet of information in today&rsquo;s analyst call on the matter. This concerned the possible role of busulfan preconditioning &ndash; separately posited as a possible cause of the AML &ndash; which now too has apparently been ruled out.</p>
<p>On the call, seemingly convened to formalize what <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/snippets/bluebird-sings-select-group-investors"">the company had controversially told an investor conference two weeks ago</a>, bluebird&rsquo;s chief medical officer, Dave Davidson, said vector was present in the AML blasts. This suggested that these cells were not in the patient during preconditioning so, barring a role for residual busulfan, preconditioning was not to blame. This is important for the entire gene therapy field, which frequently uses busulfan with lentiviral gene transfer.</p>
<h2><strong>AVEO Oncology gets the long-awaited greenlight to market tivozanib </strong></h2>
<p>Seven years after AVEO Oncology&rsquo;s tivozanib was subjected to a scathing dressdown by the FDA&rsquo;s cancer czar Richard Pazdur - followed by a swift rejection and a bumping road toward refiling - the tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/long-awaited-fda-approval-for-aveo-oncology-s-fotivda"">approved for relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma, commented Amber Tong writing on Endpoints News.</a> Known for over a decade as tivo, the drug will now be marketed as Fotivda.</p>
<p>It was a much narrower label than what they had initially sought, but the approval marked the best news the Boston biotech has put out in years. Shares shot up 89.11% to $15.28 soon after the announcement hit the wires, and then some more in after-market trading.</p>
<p>The OK, though, sets off a scramble to make the most out of the drug before its US patent expires in 2022. Aveo said it&rsquo;s applying for a patent term extension to stretch it out to 2027.</p>
<p>AVEO had been touting data from a pivotal Phase III trial that they said suggested tivozanib could be a next-gen treatment for kidney cancer by blocking all three VEGF receptors. What they didn&rsquo;t tell investors, though, was that the FDA had in fact recommended a new trial, raising concerns about the trial design (it was so flawed, they said, it was hard to determine how toxic the drug was) and disappointment over the proposed label.</p>
<p>Those issues were only blown open when the agency convened an expert panel to examine them. Most notably, regulators revealed that while tivozanib improved disease-free progression by 20%, it also increased the risk of death by 25%.</p>
<p>They ended up conducting a new trial, TIVO-3, comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. AVEO ultimately filed with the FDA in 2020 and promised that if the final analysis pointed to a final OS harvard ratio over 1.00, they would withdraw the NDA.</p>
<p>Anyone looking at AVEO&rsquo;s 89% share price surge last Wednesday might assume that US approval of the group&rsquo;s kidney cancer drug Fotivda marked a turnaround in the struggling company&rsquo;s commercial prospects, according to Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>Such hope is misplaced: AVEO&rsquo;s Fotivda&rsquo;s patent life ends soon. But the approval, 21 days before the FDA&rsquo;s action date, is an odd example of generosity on the part of a regulator seen recently as getting tough.</p>
<p>Its journey was long and tortuous, and the supporting study, Tivo-3, had begun five years ago. This is crucially important, as the kidney cancer landscape has changed significantly in the meantime, seeing anti-PD-1 therapy move front line, first combined with Yervoy and then with Inlyta or Cabometyx, and older therapies relegated.</p>","2021-03-14 10:30:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 12, 2021","News review, Merck & Co, Ridgeback, Molnupiravir, CytoDyn, Vyrologix, Lerontimab, bluebird bio, LentiGlobin, AVEO Oncology, Fotivda, Tivozanib","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 12, 2021",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-14 10:28:46","2021-03-15 09:07:49",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-12-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Cell and Gene Therapy, Infectious diseases, Oncology","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"AVEO Oncology, bluebird bio, CytoDyn, Merck & Co, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics","Fotivda, LentiGlobin, leronlimab, molnupiravir, tivozanib, Vyrologix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In the clinical trials, belimumab increased the complete renal response and primary efficacy renal response at two years compared with standard therapy alone, with benefits seen after the first year appearing stable at year two. There were no significant increases in adverse events or discontinuations compared with standard induction therapy for LN.</p>
<p>Voclosporin nearly doubled the complete response and markedly increased the partial response at one year compared with standard therapy alone. Adverse events were comparable to standard induction therapy for LN, but the FDA added a black box warning consistent with that of cyclosporin for possible serious infections and malignancies.</p>
<p>Based on this evidence, ICER determined that there is high certainty that both belimumab and voclosporin provide at least a small net health benefit compared to usual care, with the possibility of a substantial benefit (&ldquo;B+&rdquo;).</p>
<h2><strong>Key cost-effectiveness findings</strong></h2>
<p>The ICER&rsquo;s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range for belimumab is between $45,000-$61,000 per year, while the ICER estimates that belimumab&rsquo;s actual annual net US price is approximately $43,000 for patients remaining on treatment. ICER&rsquo;s HBPB for voclosporin is between $72,000-$101,000 per year, while ICER estimates that voclosporin&rsquo;s actual annual net US price is $92,000 for patients remaining on treatment.</p>
<p>The HBPB is a price range suggesting the highest US price a manufacturer should charge for a treatment, based on the amount of improvement in overall health patients receive from that treatment, when a higher price would cause disproportionately greater losses in health among other patients in the health system due to rising overall costs of health care and health insurance. In short, it is the top price range at which a health system can reward innovation and better health for patients without doing more harm than good.</p>","2021-03-13 16:08:00","ICER finds benefits for Benlysta and Lupkynis in Lupus nephritis","GlaxoSmithKline, Benlysta, Aurinia Pharma, Lupkynis, Lupus nephritis, ICER reviews, Effectiveness, Value","ICER finds benefits for Benlysta and Lupkynis in Lupus nephritis",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-13 16:06:26","2021-03-13 16:15:17",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-finds-benefits-for-benlysta-and-lupkynis-in-lupus-nephritis,,,,,,icer_big.jpg,icer_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Nephrology and Hepatology","Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access","Canada, UK, USA","Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline","Benlysta, Lupkynis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>This review follows a case of acute myeloid leukemia in a patient treated with a related bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE) drug, LentiGlobin. This medicine uses the same viral vector as Zynteglo, to deliver a gene into body cells.</p>
<p>So far, no cases of leukemia have been reported with Zynteglo itself but bluebird has paused supply of the therapy while the evidence is examined.</p>
<p>The PRAC&nbsp;will now examine the evidence, working with experts from the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Advanced Therapies, which is responsible for assessing this type of medicine, and decide on any relevant regulatory action for Zynteglo.</p>
<h2>Ifosfamide investigation complete</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in a separate investigation, the PRAC concluded that the benefits of ifosfamide solutions for infusion continue to outweigh their risks in the treatment of different types of cancers, including various solid tumors and blood cancers such as lymphomas.</p>
<p>The review was started because two recent studies suggested that the risk of encephalopathy with ifosfamide supplied in solution forms is higher than with the powder form.</p>
<p>The PRAC&nbsp;considered all available data and concluded that an increased risk of encephalopathy with ifosfamide supplied as a solution could neither be confirmed nor excluded due to limitations in the data.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;recommended that the existing warning on ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy in the product information should be updated with the latest information on this side effect.</p>

<p>This week, Denmark has temporarily stopped using the vaccine, developed by the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker along with the University of Oxford, following reports of a small number of blood clots and one death.</p>
<h2>'No indication that vaccination has caused these conditions'</h2>
<p>It is not yet known whether these episodes were linked to the vaccine, a batch of which has also been suspended from usage in Austria after a person was diagnosed with multiple thrombosis and died 10 days after vaccination, and another recipient was hospitalized with pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>An update issued after PRAC&rsquo;s meeting this week confirms that the committee is reviewing all cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination&nbsp;with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>An EMA statement explains: &ldquo;There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine. The position of&nbsp;PRAC&nbsp;is that the vaccine&rsquo;s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Recommendation to update information</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, following the assessment of a safety signal regarding cases of&nbsp;anaphylaxis with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca,&nbsp;PRAC&nbsp;has recommended an update to the product information.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the information should now state that anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity are potential side effects, with an unknown frequency, and to update the existing warning to reflect that cases of anaphylaxis have been reported.</p>
<p>The update is based on a review of 41 reports of possible anaphylaxis seen among around five million vaccinations in the UK. After careful review of the data,&nbsp;PRAC&nbsp;considered that a link to the vaccine was likely in at least some of these cases.</p>
<h2>Review of all three vaccines</h2>
<p>PRAC&nbsp;has also started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of immune thrombocytopenia in patients who received any of the three COVID-19 vaccines that were approved prior to this week. As well as the AstraZeneca jab, these include Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BNTX) Comirnaty and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>
<p>The EMA statement explains: &ldquo;After reviewing the safety reports received so far, PRAC&nbsp;decided to request an in-depth review of all available data, including case reports, clinical trials and the published literature, from the respective marketing authorization holders for these vaccines.</p>

488023,,"International supply contracts: supplying Peter and snubbing Paul?","Catherine Penny, partner, and Laura Beagrie, professional support lawyer, Stevens & Bolton, consider an important issue brought to light by the scramble for coronavirus vaccines.","<p><em>Catherine Penny (pictured above, left, with Laura Beagrie), partner, and Laura Beagrie, professional support lawyer, Stevens &amp; Bolton, consider an important issue brought to light by the scramble for coronavirus vaccines.</em></p>
<p>The recent and very public skirmish between the European Commission and AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) over the COVID-19 vaccine demonstrates the difficulties suppliers face when demand for their product exceeds supply. This is often a problem for life sciences companies, particularly those supplying drug products, but rarely is the issue debated so openly and hotly. That the competing customers are the recently-divorced UK and European Union (EU) member states has only added salt to the wound.</p>
<p>In brief: AstraZeneca is manufacturing the vital vaccine in the UK and in Europe. It has faced production delays at some European manufacturing sites but not in the UK, leading the Commission to insist that AstraZeneca must use the UK manufactured products to supply under their agreement. However, reportedly, AstraZeneca has said that its UK supply contract prevents this and its contract with the Commission requires it to make 'best reasonable efforts' to supply, which would not extend to breaching its UK supply contract.</p>
<p>With this in mind, what can life sciences companies do if, like AstraZeneca, they are unable to fulfil all their orders?</p>
<h2>Customer prioritization</h2>
<p>If a life sciences company simply does not have enough of their product to go around, it will need to prioritize supplying certain customers. This will pose both commercial and legal challenges, which should be considered together. While the legal position might not ultimately affect the priority that a company decides to afford their customers, it will affect any arguments that it may need to deploy when justifying their decision.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be an exercise in minimizing the risk of aggrieved customers pursuing claims to recover their losses and, as such, minimizing financial exposure for committing a breach.</p>
<h2>Commercial considerations</h2>
<p>Commercial considerations include how much product is available, and whether a company needs to supply some customers to the exclusion of others. If there is enough to short supply some or all customers, this may be more palatable to customers and preferable contractually. Some customers might even be willing to accept partial or delayed deliveries.</p>
<p>Then, it is important to assess the company&rsquo;s best customers. It will likely be a toss-up between your most profitable and timely payers versus long-standing or future customers &ndash; benefitting one may financially justify breaching obligations to others.</p>
<p>Some contracts may also be more expensive to fulfil (eg, due to the cost of freight or customs issues), which might influence decisions on who to prioritise. However, it will not necessarily be all about the financial profit as other, less financial, benefits may come into play and make customers more &ldquo;worthy&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>Contractual and legal considerations</h2>
<p>Contractual and legal considerations are also important since a failure to supply, or to supply less than has been ordered, may be a breach of agreement. These include the governing law of an agreement (in an international supply contract the laws of another country may be particularly relevant); the order processes specified in the contract and whether these have been complied with (if not, the relevant orders may not be enforceable); whether there are minimum order or supply thresholds that may be relied upon; and the level of obligation to supply a company is under (eg, is it an absolute one or is it to use best or even just reasonable endeavors?).</p>
<p>It is also important to consider what the contract says about the consequences of breach. For example, are there limitations or exclusions of liability or a liquidated damages clause that will limit, exclude, or define the extent of financial exposure for breach? Is it possible to terminate the contract? Or, is there is a preferment clause that may set out a priority list of customers in case of supply issues? Finally, is the agreement a 'relational contract', which would make it more likely for a duty of good faith to arise and in itself affect the order of priority? It is also worth remembering that whether the agreement is relational will depend on the facts and relationship between the parties.</p>
<p>The ability of each customer to obtain the product elsewhere (so mitigating their loss), from another supplier for example, may also affect a company&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<h2>Will force majeure help?</h2>
<p>There has been discussion about whether the current pandemic will constitute a force majeure event that excuses performance of contractual obligations, including obligations to supply. Whether force majeure will help will depend on the wording of the particular clause and the facts, including not only whether the relevant circumstances constitute force majeure but also whether or not a force majeure event has been declared in accordance with the agreed terms.</p>
<p>In general terms, where a supplier chooses to prioritize some customers above others, it seems likely that there would be challenges to arguing that a force majeure event has occurred.</p>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Having an agreement to keep the terms of the contract confidential is very useful when prioritizing contracts because it will be harder for a customer to challenge a decision to prioritize another. AstraZeneca&rsquo;s contract with the UK has not been made public, making it hard for the EU to challenge AstraZeneca&rsquo;s claim that it has to fulfil the UK&rsquo;s order before it can send vaccines manufactured in the UK to the EU.</p>
<p>While the Commission and AstraZeneca agreed to keep their agreement confidential, since the falling out they agreed that a redacted version of the contract could be published. Embarrassingly, the redactions were not wholly effective, meaning that more of the contract was visible than had been intended. However, this may not be relevant now since the entire agreement has apparently been published in the Italian media in any event.</p>
<p>But what if AstraZeneca had not consented to the contract being made public? Confidentiality agreements are notoriously difficult to enforce given the difficulties of establishing breach and, usually more significantly, demonstrating losses that have been suffered as a result of the breach. Where the confidential information has a financial value of itself it is more straightforward, but often the parties are seeking to protect commercial sensitivities rather than income-generating secrets.</p>
<p>To minimize their exposure to both lost profits and potential claims by others, life sciences companies should carry out a methodical assessment of their commercial relationships and contracts to weigh up the best course. Careful future planning, regular risk assessment and agility will help smooth the way to minimise exposure when faced with the challenge of demand exceeding supply.</p>","2021-03-12 15:44:00",,"supply, customers, contract, AstraZeneca, agreement, important, supplying, breach, force, contracts, majeure, issue, financial, commercial, commission, lif","Catherine Penny, partner, and Laura Beagrie, professional support lawyer, Stevens & Bolton, consider an important issue brought to light by the scramble for cor",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-12 12:43:15","2021-03-12 15:48:22",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/international-supply-contracts-supplying-peter-and-snubbing-paul,,,,,,catherine_penny_laura_beagrie_large.jpg,catherine_penny_laura_beagrie_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Deals, Expert View, Focus On, In Depth, Production",Europe,AstraZeneca,"COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>APEIRON designed this study in March 2020 as one of the first trials to treat hospitalized patients with the then new SARS-CoV-2 virus. The trial was conducted in Austria, Germany, Denmark and Russia. The multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, interventional Phase II trial assessed the safety, tolerability and efficacy of APN01 in 178 patients with severe COVID-19 compared to placebo. Both groups, APN01 (n=88) and placebo (n=90), also additionally received standard of care (SOC). Patients received treatment for seven days with follow-ups until day 28. March 15, 2021</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to see that treatment with APN01 has demonstrated promising clinical benefits for patients with severe COVID-19,&rdquo; said Peter Llewellyn-Davies, chief executive of APEIRON Biologics, adding: &ldquo;Our treatment has now been evaluated for the first time in patients with COVID-19&hellip;.We will now discuss the further development of APN01 with investigators, advisors and regulatory authorities in order to realize an important therapeutic option for this deadly disease.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Developed in response to the first SARS outbreak</strong></h2>
<p>APN01 was first discovered and developed in response to the first SARS outbreak by the founder of APEIRON Biologics, Prof Josef Penninger in 2003. Before clinical development in COVID-19 started in April 2020, APN01 successfully completed several clinical trials in severe respiratory diseases like acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Lung injuries caused by ARDS are one of the major symptoms of severe COVID-19.</p>

<p>The aim is to evaluate Fotivda in combination with BMS&rsquo; blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy Opdivo (nivolumab), in the pivotal Phase III TiNivo-2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory renal cell carcinoma following prior immunotherapy exposure.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed, as the FDA approval of Fotivda was based on a clinical trial comparing it with what was viewed an obsolete drug, at best showing no overall survival advantage, and pushed AVEO&rsquo;s shares up 6.6% to $12.65 in morning trading today.</p>
<p>Fotivda is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies.</p>
<h2><strong>Terms of the collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, financial terms of which are not disclosed, BMS will provide Opdivo clinical drug supply for the study. AVEO will serve as the study sponsor and will be responsible for costs associated with the trial execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the recent US FDA approval of Fotivda in the relapsed/refractory RCC setting, I look forward to further exploring Fotivda&rsquo;s immunomodulatory effects and differentiated tolerability profile in combination with Opdivo,&rdquo; said Dr Toni Choueiri, director, Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology; Director, Kidney Cancer Center; Jerome and Nancy Kohlberg Chair and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This combination was first explored in the Phase I/II TiNivo study, where it demonstrated favorable tolerability and prolonged PFS using the combination of Fotivda and Opdivo in both treatment na&iuml;ve and previously-treated patients with advanced RCC. The TiNivo-2 Phase III study is expected to further our understanding of the activity and tolerability of this combination following prior immunotherapy,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advanced RCC treatment landscape has seen significant benefit from the introduction of immunotherapy-VEGF TKI combinations in earlier-line treatment, and we believe that this benefit could extend to the relapsed/refractory setting with an effective, well-tolerated combination,&rdquo; said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive of AVEO.</p>

<p>Sasmitha Sahu, pharma analyst at GlobalData, said that China tackled the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, allowing the country to restart economic activities quickly compared to other countries in the region.</p>
<p>Ms Sahu said: &ldquo;In addition, fast-tracking clinical trials, updating the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), the Healthy China 2030 policy and growing demand for high quality treatment are all driving the domestic oncology market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center, as many as four high-value deals have already been completed within the first two months of 2021 in APAC, of which two are from China.</p>
<p>CStone Pharma (HKG: 2616) out-licensed two key late-stage immuno-oncology assets, sugemalimab (anti-PD-L1) and CS1003 (anti-PD-1), to EQRx while BeiGene (HKG: 6160) out-licensed tislelizumab (anti-PD-1) to Novartis (NOVN: VX). Tislelizumab was already approved in China for classical Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma and locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.</p>
<p>Ms Sahu added: &ldquo;Both the deals are related to either late-stage development molecules or already established molecules in China. This is a win-win situation as it gives opportunity for novel therapies developed in China to gain global access while the licensee companies can leverage drug development cost and time benefits associated with shorter time-to-market molecules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GlobalData reveals that 41 high-value deals have been completed in APAC since 2011, of which over 24 are related to oncology, with 10 involving Chinese companies.</p>
<p><img title=""unnamed-5.jpg"" src=""/media/project_tpl/image/unnamed-5.jpg"" alt=""unnamed-5.jpg"" width=""800"" height=""424"" /></p>
<p>Ms Sahu said: &ldquo;Despite the COVID-19 situation, deals valued at more than $1 billion in China witnessed 100% year-on-year increase to four in 2020 versus two in 2019.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center, China has 3,667 ongoing clinical trials for 1,761 oncological drugs as of 10 March 2021.</p>
<p>Ms Sahu said: &ldquo;As the clinical drug development ecosystem in China evolves towards innovative therapies, clinical trials in the field of oncology are increasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, with the prevailing high cancer incidence in China, oncology will remain an undisputed therapy area choice for deal-making.</p>

HAE affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. In Japan, it is estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 people are living with HAE, but only about 450 have been diagnosed due to low awareness of the disorder in the country.</p>
<p>Takhzyro received its first approval for the prevention of HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in 2018 and the drug is now available in more than 20 countries with additional regulatory submissions ongoing worldwide.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of Takeda&rsquo;s current fiscal year, the drug &ndash; which came into Takeda&rsquo;s hands with the $62 billion acquisition of Shire - generated sales of 65.9 billion yen ($610 million), up 38% on the like year-earlier period.</p>
<h2><strong>Blockbuster sales projections</strong></h2>
<p>Analytics firm Evaluate has forecast that Takhzyro will generate annual sales of $1.74 billion by 2024, while others suggest a peak sales figure of $2 billion. Analysts at Bernstein predicted that Takhzyro will eventually dominate the HAE prophylaxis market with a 70% share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HAE is unpredictable, debilitating and potentially life-threatening, and recognition of the disease remains low in Japan, meaning there are significant challenges relating to diagnosis and access to effective therapies,&rdquo; said Naoyoshi Hirota, general manager, Takeda Development Center, Japan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lanadelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein activity, with a proven efficacy and safety profile as a preventive treatment for HAE attacks. Takeda is committed to bringing important therapies such as lanadelumab to patients with high unmet medical needs around the world. Subject to approval, we are looking forward to providing lanadelumab as a new treatment option for patients in Japan living with HAE,&rdquo; he added.</p>","2021-03-12 12:14:00","Takeda files Japan NDA for lanadelumab for HAE","Takeda, Takhzyro, Japan, NDA, Angioedema, Hereditary,  HAE, Lanadelumab","Takeda files Japan NDA for lanadelumab for HAE",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-12 12:12:51","2021-03-12 12:21:52",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/takeda-files-japan-nda-for-lanadelumab-for-hae,,,,,,takeda_corporate_large.jpg,takeda_corporate_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Rare diseases","Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation",Japan,Takeda,"lanadelumab, Takhzyro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Final efficacy numbers from a large UK-based study show the candidate was 96.4% effective against mild, moderate and severe disease caused by the original COVID-19 strain.</p>
<p>Less encouragingly, a different set of results from a Phase IIb trial in South Africa show efficacy of 55.4% - the majority of strains in this region are of the B1.351 type.</p>
<p>However, both studies reached the statistical bar for success, and showed 100% protection against severe disease, including all hospitalization and death.</p>
<h2>High demand</h2>
<p>The positive results will come as a relief for governments around the world, as demand for coronavirus vaccines outstrips supplies, including in Europe.</p>
<p>With tensions running high, excess demand has led to international disputes, with the EU demanding earlier in the year that AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) should tap into its UK supply chain to make up for a shortfall.</p>
<p>More recently, the USA told EU officials that it would not permit stocks of American-made COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca to be exported, despite the US FDA not yet having approved the vaccine.</p>
<p>The Novavax jab could help alleviate the situation. The company has previously said it should be able to produce up to 150 million vaccine doses monthly by the middle of the year.</p>
<p>Regulators in the UK, Europe and elsewhere are already reviewing data from the trials and are expected to deliver a verdict on approval in the near future.</p>
<p>Commenting on the trial results, chief executive Stanly Erck said: ""We are very encouraged by the data showing that NVX-CoV2373 not only provided complete protection against the most severe forms of disease, but also dramatically reduced mild and moderate disease across both trials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The revenue goal of 1 trillion yen (around $9 billion) by fiscal year2030 represents more than doubling of current revenues in GEM BU. This potential growth will be&nbsp;primarily&nbsp;driven by a balanced geographical focus and targeted portfolio investments in the company&rsquo;s highly innovative 14 Global Brands and Wave 1 pipeline assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Building upon Takeda&rsquo;s global vision to bring long-term value to patients,&nbsp;society&nbsp;and shareholders, we have sharpened our regional strategy to deliver healthcare in geographies that include 85% of the world&rsquo;s population. As a purpose-led, patient-centric&nbsp;and values-based company, our portfolio combines innovative therapies with the right degree of scale to be competitive. Together with attractive market fundamentals and an executive team equipped to deliver strong business performance, we are committed to delivering sustainable revenue growth while increasing patient access to our life-saving 0and life-transforming treatments,&rdquo; said Ricardo Marek, president of Growth &amp; Emerging Markets Business Unit at Takeda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 95% of GEM BU&rsquo;s current revenues coming from innovative treatments aligned with the company&rsquo;s five key business areas, GEM BU has an ambition to outpace forecasted market revenue growth for the region over the next ten years.</p>
<h2><strong>Key source of revenues expected from emerging markets</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Emerging Markets will be a key source of revenue and momentum for Takeda over the next decade, with a strategy aligned to our global innovation focus,&rdquo; said Costa Saroukos, Takeda&rsquo;s chief financial officer, adding: &ldquo;Through targeted investments in the portfolio and key markets, we expect growth of the GEM BU to outpace the market for specialized, innovative treatments, as we expand our 14 global brands and launch our&nbsp;Wave 1 pipeline assets in the region.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Takeda&rsquo;s GEM BU is targeting expansion in high growth markets such as Brazil, China and India. These markets are expected to provide strong platforms for continued growth of existing brands and upcoming launches of Takeda&rsquo;s Wave 1 pipeline assets across key therapeutic areas. China in particular is expected to be&nbsp;a significant growth driver for Takeda on a regional and global level,&nbsp;with the potential to&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;revenue growth at&nbsp;a compound annual growth rate of over 20% over the next five years.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Takeda&rsquo;s innovative R&amp;D engine is also expected to add potentially transformative therapies to the GEM BU&rsquo;s current portfolio. Among the Wave 1&nbsp;pipeline&nbsp;assets, Takeda&rsquo;s dengue vaccine candidate (TAK-003), developed to address the 390 million global dengue infections every year, is projected to be a significant growth driver for the region, with&nbsp;the&nbsp;majority of projected revenues coming from GEM BU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reacting to the announcement, the Global Fund said it &ldquo;applauds the US government for approving emergency funding for the Global Fund&rsquo;s effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries.&rdquo; This unprecedented support will rapidly accelerate the Global Fund&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, which is critical to save lives and protect the gains its partnership has made against HIV, TB and malaria over the last two decades.</p>

<p>After a thorough evaluation, the EMA&rsquo;s human medicines committee, CHMP, concluded by consensus that the data on the vaccine were robust and met the criteria for efficacy, safety and quality.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen&rsquo;s vaccine thus joins Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)/BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX), AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN)/Oxford and Moderna (Nasdaq: RMNA) in gaining approval for their covid jabs, with this coming on the first anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the pandemic on March 11, 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this latest positive opinion, authorities across the European Union will have another option to combat the pandemic and protect the lives and health of their citizens,&rdquo; said Emer Cooke, the EMA&rsquo;s executive director, adding, &ldquo;this is the first vaccine which can be used as a single dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement from J&amp;J this afternoon that also noted the EMA recommendation had been confirmed by the European Commission, the company said it is committed to making its COVID-19 vaccine available on a not-for profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The company aims to begin delivery of its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine to the EU in the second half of April and to supply 200 million doses to the EU, plus Norway and Iceland in 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>Results from a clinical trial involving people in the USA, South Africa and Latin American countries found that COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was effective at preventing COVID-19 in people from 18 years of age. This study involved over 44,000 people. Half received a single dose of the vaccine and half were given placebo.</p>
<p>The trial found a 67% reduction in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases after two weeks in people who received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (116 cases out of 19,630 people) compared with people given placebo (348 of 19,691 people). This means that the vaccine had a 67% efficacy.</p>
<p>The side effects with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in the study were usually mild or moderate and cleared within a couple of days after vaccination. The most common ones were pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain and nausea.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine will continue to be monitored as it is used across the EU, through the EU pharmacovigilance system and additional studies by the company and European authorities.</p>","2021-03-11 16:41:00","COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen becomes 4th backed for authorization by EMA","COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, Conditional,  Authorization,  EMA, Johnson & Johnson","COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen becomes 4th backed for authorization by EMA",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-11 16:40:15","2021-03-11 17:07:25",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-becomes-4th-backed-for-authorization-by-ema,,,,,,janssen_johnson_big.jpg,janssen_johnson_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"COVID-19 vaccines",Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation","Europe, USA","Janssen, Johnson & Johnson","COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>These results provide additional efficacy and safety data that support the use of the dose recently granted both Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration and a positive scientific opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), said Lilly.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the EMA today announced that it has started a &lsquo;rolling review&rsquo; of data on the antibodies cocktail of bamlanivimab and etesevimab to be used in combination for the treatment of COVID-19. The review will also look at bamlanivimab used alone.</p>
<h2><strong>87% risk reduction</strong></h2>
<p>This new Phase III cohort of BLAZE-1 included 769 high-risk patients, aged 12 and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 (therapy: n=511; placebo: n=258). There were four events in patients taking bamlanivimab with etesevimab and 15 events in patients taking placebo, representing an 87% risk reduction (p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together also demonstrated statistically-significant improvements on key secondary endpoints. These results are consistent with those seen in other data sets from BLAZE-1: in the previous Phase III cohort, bamlanivimab 2,800mg with etesevimab 2,800mg reduced the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by 70% and in the Phase II cohort, bamlanivimab alone reduced the risk of hospitalizations and ER visits by approximately 70%. The viral load reductions were also consistent with what was observed in the previous Phase III cohort of the study.</p>
<p>In this new Phase III cohort, there were four deaths total, all of which were deemed related to COVID-19 and all of which occurred in patients taking placebo; no deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. Across the two Phase III cohorts of the study that have been analyzed to date, there have been no deaths in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, and 14 deaths in patients receiving placebo, 13 of which were deemed COVID-19 related. In this data set, the safety profile of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together was consistent with observations from other Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials evaluating these antibodies.</p>
<p>""These positive results reinforce our previous findings and support the authorized dose of bamlanivimab 700mg with etesevimab 1,400 mg. These compelling data &ndash; in addition to the recent EUA from FDA, the CHMP decision from EMA and the recommendation for the therapy in the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines &ndash; give healthcare providers additional information regarding the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a potentially life-saving treatment to help those most at risk for severe complications of COVID-19,"" said Dr Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, adding: ""The consistent results observed in multiple cohorts of this trial over several months, even as new strains of COVID-19 have emerged, indicate bamlanivimab with etesevimab maintains its effects against a range of variants, particularly those circulating in the US.""</p>","2021-03-11 15:50:00","Positive Phase III results for Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab for","Eli Lilly, Antibody cocktail, Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab, Phase III, COVID-19, Risk reduction","Positive Phase III results for Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab for early COVID-19",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-11 15:49:42","2021-03-11 16:00:08",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-phase-iii-results-for-lilly-s-bamlanivimab-and-etesevimab-for-early-covid-19,,,,,,eli_lilly_hq_large.jpg,eli_lilly_hq_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research",USA,"Eli Lilly","bamlanivimab, etesevimab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The group, which calls itself Doctors 4 Covid Ethics, highlighted that there are serious concerns that the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines by the EMA was premature.</p>
<p>The letter describes serious potential consequences of COVID-19 vaccine technology, warning of possible autoimmune reactions, blood clotting abnormalities, stroke and internal bleeding, &ldquo;including in the brain, spinal cord and heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should all such evidence not be available&rdquo;, the authors write, &ldquo;we demand that approval for use of the gene-based vaccines be withdrawn until all the above issues have been properly addressed by the exercise of due diligence by the EMA.&rdquo;</p>

488011,,"Astellas files for Japanese approval of enfortumab vedotin","Japanese drug major Astellas Pharma says it has submitted New Drug Application (NDA) to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for enfortumab vedotin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that has progressed after anti-cancer medication.","<p>Japanese drug major Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503) says it has submitted New Drug Application (NDA) to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for enfortumab vedotin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that has progressed after anti-cancer medication.</p>
<p>If approved, enfortumab vedotin would be the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) available in Japan for people living with this form of urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. The only country to have cleared the drug for marketing so far is the USA.</p>
<p>The submission is based on two global clinical trials with sites in Japan. The Phase III EV-301 trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. The Phase II EV-201 trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, including those who have also been treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy (cohort 1) and those who have not received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and who are ineligible for cisplatin (cohort 2).</p>
<p>Enfortumab vedotin met the primary endpoints of overall survival (EV-301) and confirmed objective response rate per blinded independent central review (EV-201).</p>
<h2><strong>New option for patients who did not respond to current chemotherapy and immunotherapy</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;More than 24,000 people in Japan are diagnosed with urothelial cancer each year. For those whose cancer progresses despite treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, there is no standard treatment option currently,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Krivoshik, senior vice president and oncology therapeutic area head at Astellas, adding: &ldquo;Based on data from two global clinical trials, and following the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare&rsquo;s review, enfortumab vedotin may offer a new option for these patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv), for certain people with bladder cancer. The drug is partnered with Seagen (Nasdaq: SGEN) for the American market. Astellas and Seagen have since submitted two supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) to the FDA for Padcev: seeking to convert Padcev&rsquo;s accelerated approval to regular approval; and to include patients with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and are ineligible for cisplatin.</p>
<h2><strong>Market prospects</strong></h2>
<p>The bladder cancer therapeutics market was valued at $670 million in 2018 across the seven major markets (7MM: USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan) and is expected to grow exponentially at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6% - accruing slightly less than $5.6 billion in 2028, according to analytics firm GlobalData.</p>
<p>Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData believe that therapies such as Padcev, and its combination with Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab), sacituzumab govitecan, and bempegaldesleukin in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo (nivolumab), carry tremendous potential to benefit muscle invasive, locally-advanced and metastatic bladder cancer patients.</p>
<p>The leading therapies in terms of total annual sales in 2028 will be Padcev and Keytruda, with forecast annual sales of $2.1 billion and $1.1 billion respectively, GlobalData forecast.</p>","2021-03-11 12:41:00","Astellas files for Japanese approval of enfortumab vedotin","Astellas, Enfortumab vedotin, NDA, Submission, Japan, Cancer, Urothelial, Bladder, Padcev, Seagen","Astellas files for Japanese approval of enfortumab vedotin",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-11 12:40:11","2021-03-11 12:48:50",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astellas-files-for-japanese-approval-of-enfortumab-vedotin,,,,,,astellasuk-big.jpg,astellasuk-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Metastatic urothelial cancer",Biotechnology,Oncology,"Asia Pacific, Focus On, Regulation",Japan,"Astellas, Seagen","enfortumab vedotin, Padcev",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Making the forecasts at its Capital Markets Day for 2021 on Wednesday, Bayer predicts the Pharmaceuticals Division will post robust annual sales growth of 3% to 5% through 2023.</p>
<p>But, in 2024, Bayer anticipates a low- to mid-single digit percentage decline in this division&rsquo;s sales due to the patent expiries.</p>
<h2>'Promising late-stage assets'</h2>
<p>Werner Baumann, chairman of the board of management, said that the group was confident that the division can return to sustainable growth in 2025, with plans to further strengthen the US business and in China, and continuing to develop the research pipeline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are well under way with the market introduction of our promising late-stage pipeline assets,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>These include, in particular, the cancer drug Nubeqa (darolutamide), the cardiovascular drugs vericiguat &ndash; marketed in the USA under the brand name Verquvo &ndash; and finerenone, along with elinzanetant for the non-hormonal treatment of frequent symptoms of the menopause.</p>
<h2>Long-term investments in cell and gene</h2>
<p>Bayer is also making substantial progress in strengthening its innovation capabilities by establishing a leading position in cell and gene therapy and pursuing bolt-on acquisitions, partnerships and licensing agreements.</p>
<p>Last year alone, the company concluded more than 25 collaboration and licensing agreements and acquisitions in its Pharmaceuticals unit, most notably the takeover of the gene therapy company AskBio for up to $4 billion.</p>
<p>Bayer also announced promising initial results achieved by its cell therapy subsidiary BlueRock Therapeutics recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have begun clinical trials with a new therapeutic approach for Parkinson&rsquo;s, a neurological disorder, that could hopefully pave the way for major advances in the battle against this debilitating illness &ndash; this represents a major step forward for the entire field of stem cell therapy,&rdquo; Mr Baumann said.</p>

<p>News of the approval sent AVEO&rsquo;s shares shooting up 89% to $15.28 by close of trading yesterday, and a further 6.3% to $16.24 pre-market today.</p>
<p>The approval of Fotivda is based on AVEO&rsquo;s pivotal Phase III study, TIVO-3, comparing Fotivda to sorafenib in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. The application is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AVEO plans to make Fotivda available to kidney cancer patients in the USA by March 31, 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Already approved in EU and elsewhere</strong></h2>
<p>Fotivda was approved in August 2017 in the European Union and other countries in the territory of its partner EUSA Pharma for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC. Tivozanib has been shown to significantly reduce regulatory T-cell production in pre-clinical models. Tivozanib was discovered by Japan&rsquo;s Kyowa Kirin (TYO: 4151) and is also being studied as a new formulation by KKC in wet acute macular degeneration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe in Fotivda&rsquo;s potential to provide a differentiated treatment option for the growing number of individuals in the US with relapsed or refractory RCC, and today marks the culmination of many years of hard work and determination of many individuals to bring this therapy to patients,&rdquo; said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive of AVEO. &ldquo;With today&rsquo;s approval, AVEO begins its journey as a commercial-stage company, a noteworthy accomplishment in our industry. On behalf of the entire AVEO team, I would like to thank all the patients, their families, and caregivers whose tireless efforts made this day possible,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relapsed or refractory RCC is a devastating disease for which patient outcomes can be limited due to the trade-off between tolerability and efficacy,&rdquo; said Dena Battle, president of KCCure, adding: &ldquo;The FDA approval of Fotivda represents an exciting, meaningful advancement by providing a new treatment option for this patient population.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-11 11:06:00","Long-awaited FDA approval for AVEO Oncology's Fotivda","AVEO Oncology, Fotivda, FDA, Approval, Carcinoma, Renal cell, Cancer, Kidney","Long-awaited FDA approval for AVEO Oncology's Fotivda",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-11 11:05:44","2021-03-11 11:19:06",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/long-awaited-fda-approval-for-aveo-oncology-s-fotivda,,,,,,aveo_oncology_large.jpg,aveo_oncology_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Nephrology and Hepatology, Oncology","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"AVEO Oncology",Fotivda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>As a result of the emergence of possible problems last month, the US Food and Drug Administration placed a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/trials-of-bluebird-s-lentiglobin-now-on-fda-hold"">clinical hold</a> on the HGB-206 and HGB-210 studies of LentiGlobin for SCD and the HGB-207 and HGB-212 studies of Zynteglo (betibeglogene autotemcel) for &beta;-thalassemia.</p>
<p>Bluebird said that, based on the analyses completed to date, it is very unlikely the Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reported in its Phase I/II (HGB-206) study of LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) (bb1111) was related to the BB305 lentiviral vector (LVV).</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to our earlier findings of several well-known genetic mutations and gross chromosomal abnormalities commonly observed in AML in this patient, our latest analyses identified the integration site for the vector within a gene called VAMP4. VAMP4 has no known association with the development of AML nor with processes such as cellular proliferation or genome stability. Moreover, we see no significant gene misregulation attributable to the insertion event,&rdquo; said Philip Gregory, chief scientific officer, bluebird bio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In totality, the data from our assessments provide important evidence demonstrating that it is very unlikely our BB305 lentiviral vector played a role in this case and we have shared with the FDA that we believe these results support lifting the clinical holds on our &beta;-thalassemia and sickle cell disease programs,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>As reported by bluebird bio on February 25, 2021, laboratory analyses showed that this patient had significant chromosomal abnormalities and mutations in genes typically associated with the development of AML. Specifically, mutations in the RUNX1 and PTPN11 genes have been detected in the leukemic cells of this patient. Preliminary findings suggested that the BB305 LVV vector was present in the AML blast cells, but there was not sufficient information to determine causality.</p>
<h2><strong>Additional scientific assessments</strong></h2>
<p>Since then, and with the advice of several independent leading academic experts in lentiviral vector gene therapy, bluebird bio has performed additional scientific assessments to determine where in the genome the LVV insertion occurred, and if this integration was responsible for any change in gene regulation or gene expression nearby.</p>
<p>Multiple independent analyses have confirmed that vector insertion in the AML cells from this patient took place in the VAMP4 gene, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 4. VAMP4 itself has no known role in the development of AML or with any cellular process related to cancer.</p>
<p>Based on the available results to date, bluebird bio believes that the case of AML is very unlikely related to the BB305 LVV. Given this, the company has initiated engagement with regulators to begin the process of resuming clinical studies for sickle cell disease and &beta;-thalassemia.</p>

488000,,"Incorporating quality of life measures into drug approvals: What is the FDA’s Stance?","For over two decades, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has encouraged the incorporation of patient perspectives into drug development. A major component of the patient perspective is a drug’s effect on Quality of Life (QoL) – a concept that has always been a heterogeneous entity that lacks clear definition.","<p><strong>By Dr Nicola Davies</strong></p>
<p>For over two decades, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has encouraged the incorporation of patient perspectives into drug development. A major component of the patient perspective is a drug&rsquo;s effect on Quality of Life (QoL) &ndash; a concept that has always been a heterogeneous entity that lacks clear definition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FDA suggests that QoL is &lsquo;an abstract, multidimensional concept, which defines a patient&rsquo;s satisfaction with life in specific domains that they consider significant.&rsquo; QoL is best assessed through patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which are direct reports from the patient on their health and functional status. Most clinical trials today collect PROs as a routine part of their outcome assessment; however, there is no clear guidance on the analysis and interpretation of PROs data. This leaves the pharmaceutical industry with a major question: How much emphasis does the FDA place on QoL outcomes?</p>
<h2><strong>Quality of life may be overshadowed by more meaningful outcomes</strong></h2>
<p>Historical data on drug approvals shows that the FDA places more emphasis on &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; clinical endpoints, such as survival rate. In a systematic review, researchers assessed 210 oncology drugs that were recently approved by the FDA for new indications. At the time of regulatory approval, only about 14% of these applications had published evidence related to QoL; only 3% of these drugs had demonstrated clinically-meaningful improvements in QoL.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, its 2018 guidance document on clinical trial endpoints for cancer drugs and biologics, the emphasis is largely on survival. Patient-centered assessment is described as &lsquo;improvement&rsquo; or &lsquo;progression&rsquo; of symptoms.<sup>2</sup> The emphasis on patient perspective &ndash; and by extension QoL &ndash; is not clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>New guidance in the pipeline to clear confusion</strong></h2>
<p>In 2016, after the US Senate passed the historic 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act, the FDA modified its drug approval process. While the primary purpose was to expedite the approval of new drugs and medical devices, this modification also emphasized the importance of incorporating the patient&rsquo;s voice during the drug development process. Recognizing the gap in guidance with respect to the patient perspective, the FDA has announced that it is publishing a series of regulatory documents that will guide the industry on engaging in patient-focused drug development.<sup>3,4</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Collecting &lsquo;patient experience data&rsquo; will be key to regulatory decision making&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The new guidance documents place great emphasis on collecting and interpreting patient experience data. As the name suggests, patient experience data collects information on the patient&rsquo;s experience with the disease. Patient experience data consists of two arms:<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Data related to the physical and psychosocial impact of the disease:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signs and symptoms of the disease, and patient views on how these affect daily functioning;</li>
<li>The course of disease over time &ndash; the patient&rsquo;s views on how the disease has impacted their QoL over the years;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The patient&rsquo;s experience with various treatment strategies in the past &ndash; accessibility and convenience of treatments, perceived clinical improvements, and side-effects encountered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data related to the patient&rsquo;s views and preferences for different treatment strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>What needs still remain unmet despite treatments that are currently available;</li>
<li>The patient&rsquo;s expectations of benefits from future treatments as opposed to current ones;</li>
<li>The patient&rsquo;s tolerance to various side-effects;</li>
<li>The patient&rsquo;s viewpoint on the trade-off between risks and benefits: what kind and magnitude of side-effects would be acceptable to them in view of the perceived benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Guidance documents on the utilization of patient experience data in the regulatory process</strong></h2>
<p>Over the next year, the FDA aims to publish four documents on patient experience data that will offer guidance to the pharmaceutical industry during the drug development process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Collection of data:</strong> This document offers information on identifying the target population, sampling strategies, and methods for collection and management of data. This guidance was officially released in June 2020.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Identifying important parameters: </strong>This document provides guidance on how to identify disease parameters that would be considered significant from the patient&rsquo;s perspective. The burden of disease and the burden of treatment is considered as a part of this guidance, which is due for release this year.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Developing fit-for-purpose clinical outcome assessments: </strong>Once patient-centered parameters are obtained, they must be refined and used to formulate clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools that can be used for the investigational product being studied.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Converting COA tools into meaningful study endpoints:</strong> COA tools that have been developed from the patient perspective must be validated to measure defined study endpoints. This guidance document will explore methods and technologies to analyze COA data. The third and fourth parts of the guidance are still under development, and industry stakeholders have been invited to submit draft guidance.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>What all this means for the pharmaceutical industry</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the ongoing emphasis on patient-centricity, the pharmaceutical industry has still not adopted the concept as a significant part of the drug development process. A recent systematic review, which assessed phase I trials that had been conducted over a period of four years, pointed out that only 1.1% of studies used QoL measures as endpoints; even in these studies, the measures used were heterogeneous.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the FDA&rsquo;s current stance, the pharmaceutical industry must incorporate patient experience data early in the drug development process. It may be worthwhile to engage with subject matter experts, such as patients, caregivers, and advocacy groups, to collect patient data and develop COA tools even prior to phase I trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidelines published by the FDA are non-binding recommendations; however, they do provide insight into the agency&rsquo;s current thinking on the topic. Going forward, COA tools that emphasize the patient perspective will be taken into consideration during the regulatory approval process. While industry stakeholders are welcoming the FDA&rsquo;s current stance of patient-focused drug development, experts believe further clarification is needed from the FDA on the regulatory decision-making process.<sup>6</sup> The release of the new guidance on formulating and analyzing COA tools may help the pharmaceutical industry in their efforts to keep the patient perspective at the center during the drug lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These include conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).</p>
<p>These diseases are major causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. The partnership will involve a close collaboration between the two companies. Under the agreement, DotBio's Hong Kong subsidiary, DotBioHK, is responsible for generating multiple multi-valent and/or bi-specific stabilized and humanized single-domain antibody candidates for various targets using DotBio's proprietary DotBody technology.</p>
<p>Uni-Bio is responsible for Chemical Manufacturing Control (CMC), Investigation New Drug (IND) submission, clinical trial and commercialization. &nbsp;DotBio will receive upfront and research payments, and is eligible for milestones and royalties, with the option to obtain additional stakes in these projects by participating in their later-stage development.</p>
<h2><strong>Eye disease populations</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysts Frost &amp; Sullivan, the patient populations of major eye diseases in China were much larger than those in the USA, whereas the size of China's ophthalmic drug market accounted for only one-fifth of that of the USA in 2019, indicating a strong growth potential of China's ophthalmic drug market. Among the four types of retinal diseases, prevalence of wet AMD increased more rapidly than the other three because of aging population.</p>
<p>The majority of patients with wet AMD experience severe vision loss in the affected eye within approximately two years after diagnosis of the disease. The prevalence of wet AMD in China was 3.4 million in 2017 and is expected to reach 4.0 million in 2022 and 4.8 million in 2030. We believe that there is a significant commercial demand for the treatment of Wet AMD. As people are gaining awareness on the importance of eye examination, they can be given access to the life-changing, sight-saving therapies. The unmet needs in the AMD market are set to be addressed in the coming years.</p>
<p>""We are excited to collaborate with Uni-Bio to explore the potential of our DotBody technology in the ophthalmology space.

487998,,"Alarm bells over FDA inspections backlog","The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address a backlog in inspections that has been worsened by the pandemic.","<p>The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address a backlog in inspections that has been worsened by the pandemic.</p>
<p>A halt on non-mission-critical foreign and domestic inspections led to the number of drug establishment inspections the agency carried out in 2020 dropping to less than half what it was in the previous two financial years, according to a GAO report.</p>
<h2>'Inspections failed to keep up'</h2>
<p>This report prompted Rosa Luisa DeLauro, the US Representative for Connecticut's third congressional district, to speak out in her position as chair of the House Appropriations Committee Chair and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.</p>
<p>She told the subcommittee's oversight hearing on the FDA&rsquo;s foreign drug inspections program: &ldquo;When most Americans take a pill out of the medicine cabinet, they may not think twice about where the ingredients in it came from. But as foreign manufacturing of drugs has grown considerably in recent years, it is now estimated that around 80% of all drug ingredients come from foreign countries. Unfortunately, the FDA&rsquo;s foreign drug inspections program has failed to keep up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GAO has studied FDA&rsquo;s oversight of the global pharmaceutical supply chain since 1998 and the results are not good. GAO has included the FDA on its high-risk series since 2009.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Notice period creates uncertainty</h2>
<p>An issue raised by the subcommittee is that the FDA gives foreign drug manufacturers, but not American ones, 12 weeks advanced notice of inspections, allowing foreign manufacturers to potentially fabricate or shred data, use hidden laboratories, or secretly repeat tests before the FDA inspectors arrived.</p>
<p>In unannounced inspections, investigators have found issues the plants were unable to hide such as important manufacturing records tossed in a trash bin, bird and insect infestations, even human urine puddled on the floor, creating a manufacturing area that is neither safe nor sterile.</p>
<p>The result of these shoddy practices is that drugs with unapproved ingredients, toxic impurities, and dangerous particulates make their way into American medicine cabinets.</p>
<p>Examples of damaging cases include hundreds of Americans dying from contaminated heparin, an anticoagulant drug manufactured overseas, in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>Then, in 2018 and 2019, dozens of blood-pressure and anti-ulcer drugs were recalled because they contained more than 200 times the acceptable limit of a known carcinogen.</p>
<h2>GAO report 'stunning'</h2>
<p>Now the concern is that the pandemic has made the FDA&rsquo;s work to prevent potentially tainted drugs from entering the USA even more difficult.</p>
<p>While the FDA has said that it could use other tools to serve as supplements to FDA inspections, the GAO fears that postponements could create a backlog of inspections of facilities that have never been inspected or that have not been inspected within five years.</p>
<p>If postponements continue, it could both extend the maximum interval between FDA inspections beyond the agency&rsquo;s five-year policy and reduce the resources available in fiscal year 2022 for inspecting the other highest priority facilities.</p>
<p>Ms DeLauro said: &ldquo;The GAO report was stunning. And that even so that the FDA uses alternative inspection tools to maintain some oversight of drug manufacturing quality while inspections are paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the tools rely on inspections conducted by foreign regulators and requesting and reviewing records and other information and sampling and testing drugs, FDA has determined that inspections conducted by certain European regulators are equivalent to and can be substituted for an FDA inspection. That is wrong because other tools provide useful information but are not equivalent to what rate of inspection we deal with at the FDA. And we also know that the GAO reported from 2016 to 2018 both foreign and domestic inspections decrease.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-10 12:50:00",,"inspections, drug, foreign, backlog, drugs, FDAs, report, pandemic, manufacturing, bells, Alarm, years, address, Administration, Food, called, Office, tool","The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address a backlog in inspections that has been worsened",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-10 12:40:37","2021-03-10 13:47:40",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/alarm-bells-over-fda-inspections-backlog,,,,,,fda_big.jpg,fda_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Coronavirus, Focus On, Production, Regulation, US FDA",USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>However, AbbVie has taken an edge over Gilead in terms of HCV-related digital initiatives, finds analytics company GlobalData.</p>
<p>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pharmaceutical Intelligence Center&rsquo;, the number of diagnosed prevalent cases of HCV in Japan is estimated to decrease from 1,152,875 in 2021 to 1,149,314 in 2025.</p>
<p>Leading direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) launched for HCV treatment in Japan include Gilead&rsquo;s Sovaldi (sofosbuvir; March 2015), Harvoni (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir; July 2015), and Epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir; January 2019), and AbbVie&rsquo;s Viekirax (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir; September 2015) and Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir; September 2017).</p>
<p>Venkat Kartheek Vale, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Japan had a high prevalence of HCV, which led to the increased uptake of marketed DAAs by AbbVie and Gilead due to high cure rates. While high cure rates are going to reduce the diagnosed prevalent cases and subsequently decrease the market size, AbbVie and Gilead are still trying to leave no stone unturned to sustain their presence and dominate the market by offering branded and unbranded digital support for patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s &lsquo;Digital Marketing Intelligence&rsquo; identified AbbVie&rsquo;s branded websites such as &lsquo;Maviret.jp&rsquo; and Gilead&rsquo;s &lsquo;Epclusa.jp&rsquo;, &lsquo;Harvoni.jp&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Sovaldi.jp&rsquo;, and unbranded websites such as &lsquo;Cgatakanen-support.net&rsquo;, BMS&rsquo; &lsquo;Kanen-net.info&rsquo;, Gilead&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hcvcanbecured.jp&rsquo; and &lsquo;Naosou-cgatakanen.jp&rsquo;, and Mitsubishi Tanabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kankinou.net&rsquo;.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital traffic</strong></h2>
<p>An analysis of the traffic over the last 18 months (June 2020 to February 2021 versus September 2019 to May 2020) revealed highest traffic to the unbranded websites of BMS&rsquo; &lsquo;Kanen-net.info&rsquo; and Mitsubishi Tanabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kankinou.net&rsquo; that support multiple liver diseases, followed by AbbVie&rsquo;s dedicated unbranded site for HCV, &lsquo;Cgatakanen-support.net&rsquo;. Among the branded websites, AbbVie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Maviret.jp&rsquo; received higher traffic than Gilead&rsquo;s branded websites.</p>
<p>Mr Vale concludes: &ldquo;The HCV treatment landscape witnessed a major transformation with the launch of novel DAAs by Gilead and AbbVie in the recent years with their drugs showing high cure rates thus making the companies the current market leaders. AbbVie&rsquo;s digital initiatives to support Maviret have helped the company to position itself above Gilead, which has three marketed products including the recently approved Epclusa. Hence, an increased focus on strengthening digital presence is required from Gilead to compete with AbbVie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lenacapavir is an investigational HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, which is being tested in heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection.</p>
<p>Building on the positive primary endpoint results announced previously, new interim data show that people given the drug every six months maintained high rates of virologic suppression, with 73% achieving undetectable viral load.</p>
<p>Representing a new class of therapy, lenacapavir has the potential to make a real difference for people with multi-drug resistance, blocking HIV replication by interfering with the HIV capsid core.</p>
<p>Gilead wants to use the drug as the basis for a new long-acting regimen, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for people with HIV.</p>
<h2>Treating HIV</h2>
<p>Currently worth over $23 billion across the seven most significant markets, revenues from HIV treatments are expected to grow to $28 billion by 2029, according to industry analyst GlobalData.</p>
<p>This growth will be propelled by innovations in the treatment setting, including from new longer-acting injectables which overcome the problem of frequent dosing schedules, which negatively impact tolerance and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>If approved, Gilead&rsquo;s option could face competition from another investigational treatment, leronlimab, currently being developed by CytoDyn (OTCMKTS: CYDY).</p>
<p>Also in the mix is ViiV Healthcare&rsquo;s cabotegravir, an integrase inhibitor. Cabotegravir-based options are projected to generate the bulk of sales in the injectables segment.</p>

<p>Despite the company putting a positive spin on the data, saying continued safety, substantial improvement in the survival rate, and faster hospital discharge in critically ill COVID-19 patients had been demonstrated, investors did not buy it, and CytDyn saw its shares tank 28% to $2.91 by close of trading.</p>
<p>The trial&rsquo;s data has been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, the UK&rsquo;s Medicines &amp; Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Health Canada, and the Company is in discussions with each to determine the best path forward for approval of leronlimab for treatment of COVID-19 in critically ill population. A manuscript of the trial&rsquo;s data is being prepared and will be submitted for publication in one or more major medical journals.</p>
<h2><strong>Highlights from the trial&rsquo;s data for this critically ill population include the following:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><u>Survival benefit</u>: There was a 24% reduction in all-cause mortality (primary endpoint of the study) in the leronlimab versus placebo.</li>
<li><u>Shortened time to recovery</u>: The average length of hospital stay was reduced by six days for patients who received leronlimab with Standard of Care (SoC) compared to placebo patients who received SoC only, with a statistically significant p-value of 0.005.</li>
<li><u>Discharge alive</u>: In addition, patients who received leronlimab demonstrated an improved probability of ""discharged alive"" at Day 28 (28% versus 11%), a 166% better rate than in the placebo group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the size of this critically ill population relative to the trial&rsquo;s size (62 out of 384 patients), the company has concurrently filed an additional protocol with the FDA using the existing sites from its CD12 trial to quickly enroll patients in this population during the pendency of these ongoing regulatory discussions. CytoDyn has continued to enroll patients (45) through the open-label arm of the CD12 trial and is working with regulators here and abroad to expedite this process.</p>
<p>Nader Pourhassan, president and chief executive of CytoDyn, commented: &ldquo;Today, there are no approved drugs to effectively address the unmet medical need for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our CD12 study demonstrates leronlimab is particularly effective in treating this patient population. We believe these results are the best results ever achieved for this population in a Phase III clinical trial. A recently approved IL-6 blocker used to treat severe to critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, reduced mortality by 2% compared to the placebo group. In contrast, leronlimab demonstrated a reduction of 24% in mortality compared to the SoC treated group, which is 12 times better in reducing all-cause mortality for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The company is very excited about these results and is concurrently working with regulators here and abroad to expedite leronlimab&rsquo;s approval to treat COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-09 11:19:00","Phase III trial for leronlimab in COVID-19 patients disappoints","CytoDyn, Vyrologix, Leronlimab, Phase III, COVID-19 patients","Phase III trial for leronlimab in COVID-19 patients disappoints",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-09 11:18:05","2021-03-09 12:06:46",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-iii-trial-for-leronlimab-in-covid-19-patients-disappoints,,,,,,cytodyn_big.jpg,cytodyn_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Research","Canada, USA",CytoDyn,"leronlimab, Vyrologix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
487981,,"What will be 2021's most game-changing new drugs?","Clarivate today announced the launch of its annual ""Drugs to Watch"" list, identifying drugs entering the market or launching key indications in 2021 which are predicted to achieve blockbuster status by 2025.","<p>Clarivate Analytics (NYSE: CLVT) today announced the launch of its annual ""Drugs to Watch"" list, identifying drugs entering the market or launching key indications in 2021 which are predicted to achieve blockbuster status by 2025.</p>
<p>Beyond the unprecedented achievements of the industry&rsquo;s response to COVID-19, drug developers have advanced milestone treatments for conditions affecting millions of patients worldwide, Clarivate noted.</p>
<p>Despite a challenging year, biopharma companies managed to produce highly-effective vaccines and treatments aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2. This year&rsquo;s Drugs to Watch report also features a snapshot of the fast-emerging field of COVID-19 vaccines which analyzes vaccines that were granted emergency use authorizations/conditional approvals as of February 10, 2021.</p>
<p>Learnings from some of the adjustments the industry made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely shape biopharma R&amp;D and commercialization well beyond the immediate crisis, including: faster clinical trials, a surge in investment, increased collaboration and more remote care and consultation. Among new drugs and biologics that have either won approval or are on the cusp of doing so, Clarivate has identified four treatments that are likely to achieve blockbuster status, delivering annual sales of more than $1 billion, within five years. The <em>2021 Drugs to Watch </em>include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Aducanumab, developed by Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai (TYO: 4528) </em></strong>&ndash; a potential game changer in the fight to build a pharmacopeia against Alzheimer's disease, which affects an estimated 50 million patients worldwide. If approved, aducanumab would be the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and could unlock a monumental opportunity to radically change patientcare and transform the market. If approved, demand for treatment will be enormous, potentially even decreasing willingness to forgo this treatment for an investigational drug in future clinical trials.</li>
<li><strong><em>Bimekizumab, developed by UCB (Euronext: UCB) </em></strong>&ndash; which offers significantly fewer side effects to patients with psoriasis, a condition affecting an estimated 2%-3% of the global population, and a host of other autoimmune diseases. While bimekizumab is a late-class entrant providing incremental improvement over existing treatment options, it is expected to have best-in-class efficacy and fewer serious side effects.</li>
<li><strong><em>Relugolix, developed by Myovant (Nasdaq: MYOV) </em></strong>&ndash; one of the first of a new class of treatments, with an oral formulation to address prostate cancer, the second-most-common malignancy afflicting men, as well as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, painful conditions affecting millions of women. Its potential use for three indications increases its chances of success. The oral formulation provides advantages over the injectable GnRH agonist competitors, including convenience and better management of side effects.</li>
<li><strong><em>Vericiguat, developed by Bayer (BAYN: DE) and Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) </em></strong>&ndash; an innovative heart failure treatment and the first indicated specifically for high-risk, chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a particularly at-risk population. Vericiguat's novel mechanism of action should result in its acceptance as an add-on therapy to existing treatments. It will likely find its niche among high-risk HFrEF patients, become a welcome addition to the treatment armamentarium and expand their treatment options.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Increased rate of approvals</strong></h2>
<p>Mike Ward, vice president, life sciences and healthcare, Clarivate, commented: &ldquo;After years of declining R&amp;D productivity, the last five years has seen an increase in approvals of innovative medicines at a rate more than double what it was a decade ago. A number of drivers have aligned to achieve this improvement, including greater insight into the biological roots of diseases, oncology research benefiting from the routine introduction of biomarkers to better target therapies, the emergence of gene and cell therapies and efforts by regulatory agencies to introduce processes to accelerate medicine assessment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s list reflects a trend towards specialty drugs launching with very narrow initial indications and expanding gradually into others, over many years. This trend is particularly true for oncology therapeutics, where a still-relatively-young field of immuno-oncology agents continues to expand its applications There is a high level of expectation of commercial success for each of the drugs featured in this year's list, with some expected to tout improved safety versus alternative therapies, while others will seek to highlight novel mechanisms of action. In addition to driving future innovation, these treatments have the potential to advance human health, redefine standards of care in their categories and save or improve patient lives.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-09 10:25:00","What will be 2021's most game-changing new drugs?","Drugs to watch, Clarivate, Aducanumab, Bimekizumab, Relugolix, Vericiguat","What will be 2021's most game-changing new drugs?",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-09 10:22:49","2021-03-10 09:08:36",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/what-will-be-2021-s-most-game-changing-new-drugs,,,,,,clarivate_analytics_large.jpg,clarivate_analytics_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Cardio-vascular, CNS Diseases, Dermatologicals, Neurological, Oncology","Focus On, Markets & Marketing, Regulation, Research",,"Bayer, Biogen, Clarivate Analytics, Eisai, Merck & Co, Takeda, UCB","aducanumab, bimekizumab, relugolix, vericiguat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Alexander Semyonov, president of Active Component, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading producers of active ingredients, said in an interview with Russian media, at present only 6%-8% of active ingredients for strategically important drugs are produced in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Semyonov added that, in the case of vital medicines in Russia, the overall list of such drugs consists of 215 items, but only 162 of them are produced by chemical synthesis. Of these, only 35 drugs are obtained from chemical ingredients manufactured in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Mr Semyonov, almost the same situation is observed in the majority of other countries, which are dependence on ingredients imports (primarily from China), estimated at about 90%.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Result of China&rsquo;s policy to reduce production capacities</strong></h2>
<p>Analysts believe the current situation is complicated by the fact that, since 2018, China has been pursuing a policy of gradual reduction of its production capacities in chemical sector, which is mainly due to their non-compliance with environmental standards and regulations.</p>
<p>That has led to the closure of almost 1,000 factories in China that specialized in the production of chemical compounds for drugs, and resulted in the increase of prices for active ingredients and reduction of their range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Russia, currently the federal government, together with local producers, is consider the establishment of some new vertically-integrated production that will specialize both on the manufacture of active ingredients and drugs on their basis. For this purpose, there are plans to use chemical production facilities which already exist in Russia or to attract investors to establish their factories within the country.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Government will tighten control for quality of drugs in domestic market</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the Russian government may tighten controls for the quality of drugs in the domestic market, according to recent statements by some senior Russian Ministry of Health officials and local media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is in response to a recent report, prepared by Alexei Maschan, director of the Russian Institute of Hematology, Immunology and Cellular Technologies and some other local analysts about the influx of low-quality, untested drugs to the domestic market, which has been observed in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Mr Maschan, these drugs are usually cheaper than their legal analogues, which contributes to a high demand for them from local customers. One of the reasons for this is the traditional corruption in Russia during state examination of these drugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his speech at the expert council of State Duma, Mr Maschan cited the example of Vero-Asparaginase &ndash; a drug that is produced by the local firm Veropharm (part of US company Abbott [NYSE: ABT]) and which is intended for the treatment of pediatric oncology. Despite the fact that it resulted in strong criticism from doctors and the lack of its clinical trials, it was still allowed to enter the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Maschan said this drug is a biosimilar, the quality and efficiency of which can only be verified in clinical studies based on research results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zolgensma, which has a reported list price of &pound;1.8 million ($2.5 million) per dose and is labelled the most expensive drug in the world, will be available at a price described as &lsquo;fair to taxpayers&rsquo; as part of the confidential deal struck by NHS England.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""NHS England has moved mountains to make this treatment available""</span>Rather than waiting for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to publish its final guidance, the NHS has taken the step of making it available immediately, an approach that has apparently been backed by the NICE given the importance of administering the one-off treatment as early as possible.</p>
<p>NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: &ldquo;This deal is a life-changer for youngsters with this cruel disease and for their families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SMA is the leading genetic cause of death among babies and young children, which is why NHS England has moved mountains to make this treatment available, while successfully negotiating hard behind the scenes to ensure a price that is fair to taxpayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the health service is still under real pressure from COVID-19, and NHS England is also focused on leading the national vaccination rollout, today&rsquo;s agreement is an important reminder that the NHS is looking after millions of other patients too, for whom real medical advances are now possible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Specialist services required for administration</h2>
<p>As many as 80 babies and young children could potentially benefit from Zolgensma each year. The treatment is given as a single intravenous infusion and contains a replica of the missing gene SMN1.</p>
<p>The NHS is currently identifying centers to provide the full-range services required to administer the therapy safely, with new specialist services treating patients in the coming months.</p>
<p>These services require pediatric intensive care and a wide range of other clinical expertise such as neuromuscular, paediatric respiratory medicine, immunology, infectious diseases, hepatology, renal, cardiology and endocrinology.</p>
<h2>SMA drugs coming of age</h2>
<p>Sally-Anne Tsangarides, general manager at Novartis Gene Therapies in the UK, said: &ldquo;We thank the entire SMA community of families and clinicians for their efforts to help NICE and NHS England appreciate the unmet need in SMA. We are delighted for them that Zolgensma will soon become available to the families in England who need it.</p>

<p>Last month, US pharma major Eli Lilly (NYSE LLY) received <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lilly-s-antibody-cocktail-nabs-fda-emergency-use-authorization-for-covid-19"">Emergency Use Authorization</a> (EUA) for the antibody cocktail from the US Food ad Drug Administration.</p>
<p>The opinion advises bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab administered together with etesevimab can be used for the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 in patients aged 12 years and older that do not require supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>The CHMP scientific opinion under Article 5.3 of regulation 726/2004 provides a harmonized, EU-level opinion on the efficacy, quality, and safety of the antibodies. The opinion can now be considered by the EU member states when making decisions on the use of the therapies at a national level before a formal marketing authorization is issued.</p>
<h2><strong>Sets scene for approval in low- and middle-income countries</strong></h2>
<p>""Today's CHMP recommendation is another important milestone in our efforts to extend access to antibody therapies for patients with COVID-19 around the world, providing a pathway for more EU countries to enable use of potentially life-saving treatments for COVID-19. In addition, other countries look to CHMP advice to support their own reviews. We hope this opinion will accelerate those reviews and authorizations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where Lilly is prepared to provide doses at greatly reduced costs or free of charge,"" said David Ricks, Lilly's chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>To support the opinion, the EMA reviewed Phase II and Phase III results from Lilly's BLAZE-1 trial. Results from BLAZE-1 demonstrated bamlanivimab alone reduced viral load and symptoms and&nbsp;also reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by approximately 70%, and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and death by 70% in non-hospitalized high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.</p>","2021-03-08 12:34:00","EMA advisory panel backs use of Lilly’s antibody cocktail for COVID-19","Eli Lilly, Antibody cocktail, Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab,  COVID-19, EMA, CHMP","EMA advisory panel backs use of Lilly’s antibody cocktail for COVID-19",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-08 12:33:13","2021-03-08 12:43:55",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-advisory-panel-backs-use-of-lilly-s-antibody-cocktail-for-covid-19,,,,,,eli_lilly_science_large.jpg,eli_lilly_science_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation","Europe, USA","Eli Lilly","bamlanivimab, etesevimab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Data from Study 1489 and Study 1490 show the sustained efficacy and safety profile of Biktarvy, in the treatment of HIV-1 in treatment-na&iuml;ve adults.</p>
<p>Presented at the 28th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, the results also show that there was no treatment-emergent resistance for those treated with the product.</p>
<p>Facing declining sales in its hepatitis C business, Gilead has invested heavily in Biktarvy, a three-in-one complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.</p>
<p>Swiftly reaching blockbuster status following its first approval in 2018, analysts have forecast that peak annual sales for Biktarvy could exceed $11 billion in coming years.</p>
<p>In 2020, the product generated sales of $7.26 billion, a rise of 53% on the year before.</p>

<p>STADAPHARM GmbH, which is responsible for the specialty business of the Stada Group and has many years of experience in pain therapy, is now introducing its own product portfolio for this new form of therapy. Therapy with medical cannabis is primarily directed at chronic pain patients for whom established medications, such as with opioids, do not achieve satisfactory therapeutic success. Furthermore, medical cannabis can also be used for patients with spasticity in multiple sclerosis and other neurological and oncological therapy fields.</p>
<p>""Stada is one of the first leading pharmaceutical manufacturers to expand its portfolio with medical cannabis in Germany. In doing so, we are benefiting from our expertise in the field of specialty pharmaceuticals and are complementing this with a modern portfolio of patient-specific therapies,"" explains Stada chief executive Peter Goldschmidt.</p>
<p>With this novel therapy option, Stada says it is strengthening its perception as a ""Go-To-Partner&rdquo; for doctors and pharmacists. In addition to support for current research and patient experience with medical cannabis, orientation in the prescription and reimbursement process is also to be created. In order to improve access to medical cannabis and its therapeutic benefits, Stada is committed to simplifying cannabis prescription.</p>
<h2><strong>Partnered with MediPharma</strong></h2>
<p>Last October, Stada signed a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/stada-arz-partners-with-medipharm-on-medicinal-cannabis-products"">partnership with Canada&rsquo;s MediPharm</a>, forging the way as a large pharmaceutical company commercializing medical cannabis products.</p>

<p>The US indication in question is for Tecentriq (atezolizumab), in prior-platinum treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma.</p>
<p>Swiss cancer giant Roche (ROG: SIX) was granted an Accelerated Approval for these patients in 2016, on the basis of results from the IMvigor210 study.</p>
<p>It is not an area in which the product has a major impact at present, and the withdrawal does not affect other approved indications for the checkpoint blocker.</p>

<p>Roche&rsquo;s nod for Tecentriq in bladder cancer is just one of a range of Accelerated Approvals which have not been withdrawn by the FDA, despite a lack of confirmatory data.</p>
<p>That now appears to be changing, with Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) referring in a statement to an ""industry-wide evaluation"" on the part of the US regulator, examining Accelerated Approvals which have not met post-marketing requirements.</p>
<p>Last week Merck said it would stop marketing Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a later-line option for certain people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).</p>

<p>The companies, which entered into a collaboration on the drug in May last year, over the weekend reported findings on one secondary objective from the Phase IIa study, showing a reduction in time (days) to negativity of infectious virus isolation in nasopharyngeal swabs from participants with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by isolation in Vero cell line culture.</p>
<p>These preliminary findings were presented during Science Spotlights at the 2021 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2021). Findings from the primary efficacy and safety endpoints and additional secondary objectives will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.</p>
<h2><strong>Study design</strong></h2>
<p>This multicenter US Phase IIa study enrolled 202 non-hospitalized adults who had signs or symptoms of COVID-19 within seven days and confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary efficacy objective was reduction in time to viral negativity measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. Periodic samples were collected for virologic analysis. Of the 182 participants with an evaluable nasopharyngeal swab, 42% (78/182) showed detectable levels of cultured virus at baseline. Other Phase II and Phase II/III studies are underway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to share our initial Phase II infectivity data at this important conference, which remains at the forefront for critical clinical scientific information in infectious diseases,&rdquo; shared Dr Wendy Painter, chief medical officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, adding: &ldquo;At a time where there is unmet need for antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, we are encouraged by these preliminary data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secondary objective findings in this study, of a quicker decrease in infectious virus among individuals with early COVID-19 treated with molnupiravir, are promising and if supported by additional studies, could have important public health implications, particularly as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to spread and evolve globally,&rdquo; noted Dr William Fischer, lead investigator of the EIDD-2801 2003 study and Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.</p>

487966,,"New safety readouts boost Jyseleca’s prospects in the US, says analyst","Belgian biotech Galapagos last week announced positive pooled interim results from its ongoing MANTA and MANTA-RAy safety studies for Jyseleca (filgotinib).","<p>Belgian biotech Galapagos (Euronext: GLPG) last week announced positive pooled interim results from its ongoing MANTA and MANTA-RAy safety studies for Jyseleca (filgotinib).</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, data and analytics firm GlobalData&rsquo;s analyst Rose Joachim said that the interim data from MANTA and MANTA-RAy should ease fears that Jyseleca may negatively impact sperm health in men with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or rheumatic diseases. Although the trials were not powered for comparison across groups, fewer patients treated with Jyseleca (200mg) versus placebo experienced a 50% or greater decline in sperm concentration over the initial 13-week double-blind treatment period. These data renew hope for Jyseleca in the US IBD space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although pending outcomes from these trials factored into Jyseleca&rsquo;s complete response letter in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sperm toxicity data will arguably be of greater importance when considering the drug&rsquo;s applications in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn&rsquo;s disease (CD), as these diseases are more likely to affect younger men. According to GlobalData&rsquo;s epidemiological analysis, in 2021, men between the ages of 20 and 65 will comprise around 35% of the total diagnosed prevalent cases of CD and UC (among patients 20 years of age or older). In contrast, this group of patients accounts for only 13% of cases in RA,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>If the Food and Drug Administration is satisfied with Galapagos&rsquo; interim results from MANTA and MANTA-RAy, a US filing for Jyseleca in UC could occur as early as this year, with pending approval in 2022, said Ms Joachim. However, this date could still be pushed out further, potentially to 2023, if the FDA also requires data from 26-week or even 52-week time points. Considering the extensive safety data requested when evaluating the drug&rsquo;s filing for RA, it is likely the FDA will want to see these later time points. Assuming an existing UC label and positive Phase III data, approval in CD would follow soon after.</p>
<h2><strong>Market outlook</strong></h2>
<p>She concluded: &ldquo;Gilead withdrew its FDA filing for Jyseleca in RA, but UC and CD are still very promising markets for the drug in the US. Although IBD is a smaller market than RA, with expected 2021 sales of $13.2 billion versus $20.9 billion in the USA, according to GlobalData, Jyseleca has similar or perhaps even greater sales potential in UC and CD due to more limited competition.</p>
<p>In the USA, there are currently five and six targeted immunomodulating drugs approved for the treatment of CD and UC, respectively - half the number available for RA. If approved, GlobalData forecasts sales for Jyseleca will reach $95.1 million and $129 million in UC and CD, respectively, by 2029.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-08 10:15:00","New safety readouts boost Jyseleca’s prospects in the US, says analyst","Galapagos, Jyseleca, Filgotinib, IBD, Bowel disease, Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's, Rheumatic","New safety readouts boost Jyseleca’s prospects in the US, says analyst",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-07 14:09:14","2021-03-08 10:15:40",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-safety-readouts-boost-jyseleca-s-prospects-in-the-us-says-analyst,,,,,,galapagos_large.jpg,galapagos_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Gastroenterology","Drug Trial, Markets & Marketing, Research",Belgium,"Galapagos, GlobalData","filgotinib, Jyseleca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<h2><strong>Tezepelumab Phase III confirms broad benefit</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/first-in-class-biologic-could-change-the-way-asthma-is-treated"">Phase III NAVIGATOR data</a> presented at the Academy of Allergic Asthma &amp; Immunology (AASAI) conference confirms the previously announced top-line results for Amgen and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s tezepelumab and supports its approval in severe asthma patients, particularly those with low eosinophils (Eos), noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>He believes the updated results validate tezepelumab&rsquo;s target TSLP, which is upstream of interleukin (IL)-13/IL4 (Dupixent) and IL-5 (Fasenra, Nucala), to address a relatively broad range of severe asthma patients, although it does not suggest that tezepelumab will be a dominant product in the overall category. Tezepelumab delivered a reduction in asthma exacerbations of 56% across all patients, and of 70% in high eosinophil patients, 41% in moderate Eos patients, and 39% in low Eos patients.</p>
<p>This compares to an average reduction of 40% for IL-5&rsquo;s and 46% for Dupixent in all patients and reduction of 31% for Fasenra (IL-5) and 25% for Dupixent in low Eos population (&lt;300 cells/uL). These cross-trial comparisons are difficult to make confidently, but we believe it is reasonable to assume that tezepelumab is materially better than its rivals in low Eos patients, and similar to them in moderate and high eosinophil patients. Friday&rsquo;s (2/26) data showed NAVIGATOR not only achieved statistical significance on its primary endpoint, annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) reduction, but in both patients with high baseline eosinophil (Eos &gt;300 cells/uL) and those with low Eos (&lt;300 cells/uL).</p>
<p>Even lower subgroup of patients with Eos &lt;150 cells/uL, which was not powered to show statistical significance, saw numerically comparable reduction to the &lt;300 patient group. We believe the results certainly support tezepelumab&rsquo;s approval and we expect significant penetration among low Eos count patients who do not respond to current biologics. However, Mr Porges also believes tezepelumab will face tougher competition in high Eos count patients where KOLs will consider other factors when choosing a biologic since efficacy is comparable. He also expects that the lack of steroid reduction benefit (due to failure of Phase III SOURCE study) could diminish tezepelumab&rsquo;s appeal compared to other biologics in the high Eos patients.</p>
<p>He assumes tezepelumab will launch in 2022, growing to $1.2 billion by 2025E and $1.8 billion by 2027E (US sales as reported by Amgen).&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Olumiant leads the alopecia JAK pack</strong></h2>
<p>Eli Lilly and Incyte last Wednesday claimed the first pivotal win for a JAK inhibitor in alopecia &ndash; but it might not be the last. The groups&rsquo; <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/first-jak-inhibitor-to-show-hair-regrowth-in-phase-iii-alopecia-trial"">Olumiant succeeded in Brave-AA2</a>, but Pfizer is not too far behind with its JAK3/TEC inhibitor ritlecitinib, whose Phase II/III study is also set to report in 2021, noted Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>Lilly is not disclosing data from Brave-AA2, only saying that both doses tested, 2mg and 4mg once daily, met the primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of patients achieving a severity of alopecia tool (Salt) 20 score at 36 weeks. Ritlecitinib&rsquo;s Allegro-IIb/III trial also evaluates Salt 20, at week 24, so if it hits it will be interesting to see how the projects stack up. Safety will also be under scrutiny given JAK inhibitors&rsquo; track record. Lilly said that in Brave-AA2 Olumiant&rsquo;s safety profile was consistent with experience in rheumatoid arthritis, for which it is Food and Drug Administration approved, and atopic dermatitis, for which it has European Medicines Agency approval.</p>
<p>Still, Olumiant&rsquo;s US label has a black box warning for serious infections, malignancies and thromboses, which might hurt its chances in a disease like alopecia. The sell-side forecasts Olumiant sales of $1.2 billion in 2026, according to <em>EvaluatePharma</em> consensus, but none of this is expected to come in alopecia.</p>
<p>Ben Fidler, writing on BioPharma Dive, pointed out that there are no approved treatments for alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that affects as many as 147 million people worldwide. That could soon change, as Lilly's drug and several others like it &mdash; medicines known as JAK inhibitors &mdash; are moving through late-stage trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alopecia areata has been viewed as a promising area of research for JAK inhibitors after a 2014 Nature paper showed they may help reverse hair loss. The disease, which occurs when the immune system attacks hair follicles, is the second-leading cause of baldness, which can lead to anxiety, depression and other health issues. There are no drugs specifically approved for the disease, though immunosuppressive drugs are used off-label. People can also opt for wigs and hairpieces or hair-regrowth methods like platelet-rich-plasma therapy or minoxidil.</p>
<p>JAK blockers, by contrast, are meant to tamp down the immune response and help regrow hair. That's led to significant interest among pharma companies and biotechs. Lilly and Incyte, Pfizer and Concert Pharmaceuticals each have programs in late-stage testing, said Mr Fidler.</p>
<h2><strong>G1 Therapeutics &ndash; brighter days ahead</strong></h2>
<p>Commenting on the recent <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cosela-now-launched-in-usa-for-people-with-extensive-stage-sclc"">approval and subsequent launch</a> last week of G1 Therapeutics and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s Cosela, blogger The GARP Investor wrote on Seeking Alpha.</p>
<ul>
<li>G1 Therapeutics' first in class drug, myelosuppression drug, Cosela (trilaciclib) has blockbuster potential.</li>
<li>Management has positioned the company to succeed in their commercialization efforts.</li>
<li>Massive sell-off after FDA approval has created a buying opportunity in the stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in a start-up biotech company is an absolute roller coaster. Clinical trials can both bring highs and lows to excess in terms of stock price and subsequently investor interest / confidence. The industry is admittedly risky, but that should not deter anyone from looking for potential market beating investments.</p>
<p>The blogger believes that the recent approval of oncology drug trilaciclib (commercial name Cosela) in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer from company G1 Therapeutics has made the company worth looking into, and the subsequent approval-led sell-off by short-term profit takers has brought the stock price to a level I feel makes a compelling investment long term. It looks to me that the market is pricing in massively sub-par performances from the drug, and anything more will produce a large increase in the stock price. The company is also not a one trick pony, as Cosela is undergoing multiple other clinical trials in different cancers with larger addressable markets. G1 also has another compound in clinical trials called Rintodestrant, an oral SERD that it expects phase 2 data on in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Now that FDA approval is out of the way, the make-or-break moment for Cosela&rsquo;s success is undoubtedly initial drug launch. This is admittedly a big risk considering G1 has had no prior drug approvals, and Cosela is a first in class drug that is creating an entirely new market. While there are many variables at play, the most important things I look at to determine G1&rsquo;s probability of success are the quality of management, their sales plan to bring the drug to market, and overall prescriber optimism.</p>
<h2><strong>Five Prime&rsquo;s lesson in never giving up</strong></h2>
<p>It is said that even the most hopeless biotech companies never die, but <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-replenishes-its-pipeline-with-1-9-billion-acquisition"">Five Prime, which is being bought by Amgen</a> for $1.9 billion, would never have been content just to survive in the graveyard shift. The takeover rewards its drastic restructuring of 2019, and completes a rags to riches to rags to riches fairy tale, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>There is another angle too: Amgen has a desperately thin pipeline, which through various setbacks is now hugely dependent on the Kras inhibitor sotorasib, an asset with big potential and much to prove. In pulling the acquisition trigger Amgen seems at last to have acknowledged this fact.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is some years since the once-acquisitive Amgen did anything as decisive as this. The company&rsquo;s buyouts of Biovex, Micromet and Onyx, worth over $12 billion combined, took place in 2011-13, and since then the only things to get bankers excited have been the $2.7 billion purchase of 20% of BeiGene and the $13.4 billion buy of Celgene's psoriasis drug Otezla, both in 2019.</p>
<p>But with the largely unproven sotorasib carrying 2026 revenue forecasts of $2 billion, according to <em>EvaluatePharma </em>sell-side consensus, Amgen needs to do a lot to avoid disappointment. In Five Prime it found the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>It is hardly believable that barely two years ago Five Prime was sitting on an 80% two-year share price loss after its Bristol Myers Squibb-partnered anti-CSF-1R MAb cabiralizumab disappointed, and the company resorted to cutting costs and sweeping out its C-suite.</p>
<p>In hindsight its decision to focus on bemarituzumab, an FGFR2B inhibitor, was a masterstroke. This wholly-owned asset has virtually no mechanistic rivals; when it added a mid-stage survival benefit string to its bow last November the phones at Five Prime&rsquo;s business development department must have started to ring.</p>
<p>Amgen has been fairly transparently &ldquo;clearing the decks&rdquo; for significant M&amp;A in recent months, and the deal makes strategic sense in the context of Amgen&rsquo;s oncology pipeline, commented SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>The premium (+79% to Five Prime&rsquo;s last close) is reasonable given bemarituzmab&rsquo;s late stage in development. After Amgen&rsquo;s fourth-quarter print, Leerink wrote that the company appeared to be signaling a transaction coming down the pipe (by &ldquo;clearing the decks&rdquo; in their pipeline and restructuring their salesforces), and it noted that Amgen&rsquo;s key assets, sotorasib (KRAS) and tezepelumab (TSLP), alone were not enough to offset pricing headwinds and LOEs in the mid-2020s.</p>
<p>The Five Prime purchase is a fairly small transaction for Amgen relative to Leerink&rsquo;s expectations for the year and Amgen&rsquo;s capabilities for M&amp;A, so Mr Porges believes there could be more to come to further build out the pipeline. He does not expect any regulatory objections to the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, nor does he believe a higher offer for the company is likely.</p>
<p>This transaction makes sense for Amgen, in his view &ndash; it's relatively small, bolsters the company&rsquo;s solid tumor franchise, should have operational synergies with sotorasib, offers potential well beyond its initial indication and has some (limited) platform value as well. The dilution to Amgen&rsquo;s future earnings should be modest (particularly after the pipeline rationalization at the end of the year) and Amgen&rsquo;s future revenue profile and growth outlook is improved by the acquisition, Mr Porges concludes.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-07 13:46:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 5, 2021","News review, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Tezepelumab, Eli Lilly, Incyte, Olumiant, G1 Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cosela, Five Prime, Bemarituzumab","Look back at pharma news in the week to March 5, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-07 13:43:31","2021-03-07 14:03:51",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-march-5-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Autoimmune Disorders, Immunologicals, Oncology, Respiratory and Pulmonary","Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Five Prime Therapeutics, G1 Therapeutics, Incyte","bemarituzumab, Cosela, Olumiant, tezepelumab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The approval makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for patients with indolent follicular lymphoma, follows FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation and a priority review, and marks the third approved indication for a Kite cell therapy.</p>
<p>The approval is based on results from ZUMA-5, a single-arm, open-label study in which 91% of patients with relapsed or refractory FL (n=81) responded to Yescarta, including an estimated 74% of patients in a continued remission at 18 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Among all FL patients, median duration of response was not reached at a median follow-up of 14.5 months. In the safety analysis set (n=146), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities occurred in 8% and 21% of patients, respectively.</p>
<p>Gilead acquired Kite in 2017 in a $12 billion deal, attracted by its pipeline, notably Yescarta. But so far, the CAR-T cell therapy has generated disappointing sales, recording full-year 2020 revenue of just $563 million, up 23% on 2019. Yescarta has previously won approvals in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.</p>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;An important addition to the treatment armamentarium&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Once a follicular lymphoma patient&rsquo;s disease relapses, the duration of response to care shortens with each round of therapy,&rdquo; said Dr Caron Jacobson, medical director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. &ldquo;Additionally, for follicular patients in the third line of therapy, the five-year survival rate is only 20%, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that offer a real chance for durable remission. Impressively, 9%1 of follicular lymphoma patients in the ZUMA-5 study responded to a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, including an estimated 74% of patients in a continued remission at 18 months, giving these patients much-needed hope and oncologists an important addition to the treatment armamentarium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we look to bring the hope of survival to more patients in need, today&rsquo;s FDA decision represents a real step forward in our commitment in hematologic malignancies,&rdquo; said Christi Shaw, chief executive of Kite, adding: &ldquo;Advancing CAR T therapies for patients across lymphomas remains a cornerstone of our cell therapy development program, and we are excited about the potential of Yescarta for patients with indolent follicular lymphoma.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-06 14:33:00","US FDA approves new indication for Yescarta","Gilead Sciences, KIte, Yescarta, FDA, Approval, Lymphoma, Follicular","US FDA approves new indication for Yescarta",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-06 14:32:48","2021-03-06 14:39:51",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-fda-approves-new-indication-for-yescarta,,,,,,kite_large-jpg.png,kite_small-jpg.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Hematology, Immuno-oncology","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"Gilead Sciences, Kite Pharma",Yescarta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
487959,,"Plasma-derived therapies and the fight against COVID-19","Patrick Delavault, executive VP, scientific & medical affairs, LFB Biopharmaceuticals, provides an Expert View on how the pandemic has led to a focus on an important medicinal option for patients.","<p><em>Patrick Delavault, executive vice president, scientific &amp; medical affairs, LFB Biopharmaceuticals, provides an Expert View on how the&nbsp;pandemic has led to a focus on an important medicinal option for patients.</em></p>
<p>In 2020, we saw several leading biopharmaceutical companies combine forces in the search for therapeutic solutions to fight the current global pandemic. Little may be known about plasma-derived therapies in the world at large, but the COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on this form of treatment and highlighted its wider uses in everyday medicine.</p>
<p>Plasma-derived medicinal products and recombinant proteins are typically used to treat rare, serious, genetic, and &mdash; in many cases &mdash; life-threatening diseases caused by defective immune systems or by missing or non-functioning proteins typically found in blood plasma. These include autoimmune disorders and inherited disorders of&nbsp;hemostasis. Plasma-derived therapies also play an important role in emergency medicine.</p>
<p>As our understanding of the novel coronavirus grew, the relevance of this area of pharmaceutical medicine and healthcare quickly became apparent. In response to the pandemic, the main global players in plasma-derived medicinal products, including LFB, joined together as the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, to accelerate the development of a hyperimmune immunoglobulin investigational therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<h2>A collective effort</h2>
<p>Simply put, plasma from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that could help suppress the virus and support that person&rsquo;s immune system to respond to the infection and ultimately, increase their chance of recovery. This therapy may also be important for those unable to receive a vaccine, such as someone who is immune-compromized.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, the technical expertise of certain companies has been essential to develop analytical testing which meets WHO International Standards, to ensure convalescent plasma collection and plasma supply quality in accordance with the required quality standards, and for batch manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>Besides the CovIg-19 Plasma Alliance, many companies in the sector also responded directly to support frontline healthcare services through donations of plasma related materials and equipment. LFB, for example, provided immunoglobulin free of charge to the Paris University Hospitals Group (GHU Paris) as part of the ICAR clinical trial including patients infected by SARS Cov-2, and have provided gowns, masks or funding to a number of hospitals.</p>
<p>Collective efforts have also been made to develop antibodies which might combat early stages of the COVID-19 infection. One such candidate is XAV-19, manufactured by LFB as part of a partnership with the French biotech Xenothera. It contains a mixture of protective antibodies aimed at neutralizing the virus and preventing respiratory failure that would require intensive care treatment.</p>
<h2>A complex manufacturing process</h2>
<p>The process by which plasma-derived therapies are manufactured is both fascinating and complex. Plasma supplied at facilities licensed for fractionation is put through a rigorous testing process and then fractionated to obtain specific plasma proteins which are concentrated and purified to make high quality medicines. This process is lengthy and may take up to several months before therapies reach the patients who need them.</p>
<p>There are also relatively few production sites around the world for these medicines and so staff frequently need to be trained from the ground up when working in this area. As a result, it can take several years to reach the level required to run and supervise key parts of the manufacturing<br />process.</p>
<p>Threats from new viral strains are something we will continue to face in the future. In order for them to be mitigated, however, we have to continue to work together in collaboration with academic teams and other companies in this area to understand them and develop new therapies when needed.</p>
<h2>The impact of the pandemic on plasma collection</h2>
<p>With various lockdown restrictions across the globe, however, lower volumes of plasma donations started to be observed. To avoid any negative impact on supply for these patients who rely on plasma-derived medicinal products year-round, both industry and healthcare systems have had to develop contingency plans.</p>
<p>Of course, one way to combat declining donation rates is to increase awareness within public communities that donations are needed now more than ever. To address this need, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance has gained support from large organizations outside the plasma industry.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is to be an effective partner for important institutions such as the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), while also developing a potential roadmap for regulation that can give health authorities globally the confidence to streamline the approval process of plasma derived therapies for COVID-19. Indeed, the NIAID is sponsoring a pivotal Phase III trial which aims to test the safety and efficacy of a combination treatment regimen including the hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19 patients in the hospital setting to see whether treating patients at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms reduces the risk of significant illness.</p>
<h2>Improvements for patients with rare genetic disorders</h2>
<p>At LFB, we see the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance as the continuation and development of collaboration within the sector as we develop partnerships and provide innovative solutions for patients globally. Thus, we make our resources available to fight COVID-19 beside our daily commitment to provide medication to patients during the pandemic. While respecting the safety rules, our employees are proud that manufacturing operations during the global pandemic and localized lockdowns have never stopped, so the supply of our vital plasma-derived medicinal products and recombinant proteins has continued.</p>
<p>It is hoped by the industry that the heightened profile of this area of medicine during the pandemic will now have a long-term benefit for both public and regulatory understanding of these vital therapies, and of the need for donations, resulting in improved treatments for patients with rare genetic disorders around the world.</p>","2021-03-05 17:35:00",,"plasma, patients, plasma-derived, COVID-, therapies, medicinal, important, pandemic, process, Alliance, fight, develop, companies, medicine, proteins, View","Patrick Delavault, executive VP, scientific & medical affairs, LFB Biopharmaceuticals, provides an Expert View on how the pandemic has led to a focus on an impo",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-05 13:04:46","2021-03-05 17:36:36",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/plasma-derived-therapies-and-the-fight-against-covid-19,,,,,,patrick_delavault_large.jpg,patrick_delavault_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Autoimmune Disorders, Hematology, Immunologicals, Rare diseases","Coronavirus, Expert View, Focus On, In Depth",,,,,,,,"Plasma-derived medicinal products",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>US rival Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) reported results from the SURPASS trial program, comparing a range of doses of its GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide with a 1mg dose of semaglutide.</p>
<p>In the study, Lilly&rsquo;s option led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline across all three doses, for adults with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The data add to a picture that has been built up over recent months, with a series of late-stage readouts showing significant blood sugar and weight reductions for people taking tirzepatide.</p>
<p>They will also add to the competitive pressure on Novo Nordisk, which relied on its Ozempic franchise for 11.23 billion Danish kroner ($1.6 billion) in revenues last year.</p>
<h2>SURPASS-2</h2>
<p>Importantly, while the higher two doses resulted in double the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events - 8% compared to semaglutide&rsquo;s 4% - the lower, 5mg dose of tirzepatide was almost as well tolerated.</p>
<p>This dose led to higher weight loss - 7.6kg versus 5.7kg - and higher A1c reduction - 2.01% versus 1.86% - compared with Novo&rsquo;s option.</p>
<p>Across all treatment arms, the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Juan Pablo Fr&iacute;as said: ""Head-to-head studies are the gold standard for clinicians assessing the efficacy of investigational treatments, and these results show that all three doses of tirzepatide delivered superior A1C and weight reductions compared to the highest approved dose of semaglutide to treat type 2 diabetes.""</p>
<p>He added: ""Newer treatment options may help people with type 2 diabetes achieve their A1C and weight loss goals.

<p>The JAK-1 blocker - a class of treatment which has been beset with safety issues - was handed a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the US regulator in 2020, delaying any possible approval there in rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>The therapy is approved and marketed in this indication in Europe, the UK, and Japan, as a second-line option. In these territories, it is sold under the brand Jyseleca.</p>
<p>In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration has expressed worries about the potential impact on testicular health of the higher, more effective, 200mg dose.</p>
<p>The interim analysis shows that, of the 240 people evaluated after 13 weeks of treatment, sperm concentration fell by at least half in eight out of 120 in the test group and 10 out of 120 in the placebo group.</p>
<h2>Jyseleca progress</h2>
<p>A positive sign for what is a key asset for Galapagos, the interim data boosted the firm&rsquo;s share price on Thursday, but investors will have to wait for more complete data - due later in the year - for a clearer picture.</p>
<p>It is hard to overstate the importance of Jyseleca to the firm. As well as being central to a multi-billion dollar R&amp;D agreement with Gilead (Nasdaq: GILD), the therapy is a key test of the firm&rsquo;s technology and approach.</p>

The companies have not received a confirmed AdCom meeting date from the FDA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While disappointed with the news today, FibroGen and AstraZeneca are committed to working with the FDA to bring roxadustat to patients with anemia of CKD in the US as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Enrique Conterno, chief executive of FibroGen. &ldquo;We continue to be confident in the efficacy and safety profile of this potential new medicine based on positive results from a global Phase III program encompassing more than 8,000 patients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roche&rsquo;s (ROG: SIX) Actemra/RoActemra is the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of the disease, the Swiss pharma giant noted. Mainly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Actemra/RoActemra pulled in global sales of 2.9 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) in full-year 2020, a rise of 32%.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is an often devastating autoimmune disease that worsens over time and has no cure. It occurs when the immune system malfunctions causing tissues of the skin and lungs to thicken and harden. SSc affects about 2.5 million people worldwide. Interstitial lung disease (ILD), which may occur in around 80% of SSc patients, causes inflammation and scarring of the lungs and can be life-threatening.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The FDA approval is based on data from the focuSSced trial, a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 212 adults with systemic sclerosis. Supportive information was also used from the faSScinate trial, a Phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SSc.</p>
<p>The focuSSced trial did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 48 in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), which is a standard outcome measure for skin fibrosis (the scarring or hardening of the skin) in SSc. There also was not a statistically-significant effect on the primary endpoint of mRSS in the faSScinate trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are honored to offer the very first FDA-approved biologic treatment option to people living with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer and head of global product development, adding: &ldquo;We worked closely with the FDA to evaluate Actemra/RoActemra&rsquo;s impact on lung function in this setting.

<p>Preparations for the start of production, technology transfer and test runs are already underway. Following final agreement, Novartis plans to start production in the second quarter of 2021. First deliveries of the bulk drug product to CureVac are expected in the summer 2021.</p>
<p>Production will take place in a new high-tech production facility that was already under construction at the Novartis Kundl, Austria site. This will be adapted to the needs of messenger RNA vaccine production for CureVac&rsquo;s CVnCoV, the manufacturing of which is highly complex. Novartis plans to produce up to 50 million doses of the mRNA and bulk drug product for the CureVac vaccine in 2021 and up to a further 200 million doses in 2022. The bulk drug product will then be delivered to CureVac for further processing and filling.</p>
<h2><strong>CureVac collaborations</strong></h2>
<p>CureVac has a previous production deal for its CVnCoCoV with contract manufacturer Rentschler Biopharma. In January it reached a deal with fellow German firm Bayer (BAYN: DE) to advance its CVnCoV, under which Bayer holds options to become the marketing authorization holder in other markets outside of Europe.</p>
<p>Also, UK pharma major GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) last month entered a 150 million-euro ($180.5 million) collaboration CureVac, building on their existing relationship, to jointly develop next generation mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential for a multi-valent approach to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr Florian von der M&uuml;lbe, chief production officer of CureVac, said: &ldquo;I am very pleased that with Novartis we have found another highly experienced partner to support the production of our vaccine candidate.

487950,,"Amgen replenishes its pipeline with $1.9 billion acquisition","The USA’s largest biotech firm Amgen, which has been fairly quiet on the M&A front for a while, announced it was splashing out nearly $2 billion on an acquisition today.","<p>The USA&rsquo;s largest biotech firm Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which has been fairly quiet on the M&amp;A front for a while, announced it was splashing out nearly $2 billion on an acquisition today.</p>
<p>Amgen has reached an agreement to acquire Five Prime Therapeutics (Nasdaq: FPRX) for $38.00 per share in cash, representing an equity value of around $1.9 billion. This acquisition adds Five Prime's innovative pipeline to Amgen's leading oncology portfolio, the company said. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter and is subject to customary closing conditions.</p>
<p>Unusually for an acquirer, Amgen&rsquo;s shares were up 1.5% at $227.38 by late-morning. However, its target, Five Prime, leapt 78% to $37.83.</p>
<p>The deal represents a major win for shareholders of Five Prime, which, after a run of bad luck, was trading as low as $2.17 last March. As recently as last November, the biotech announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 7,200,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $21.00 per share.</p>
<h2><strong>Deal will strengthen Amgen&rsquo;s oncology portfolio</strong></h2>
<p>""The acquisition of Five Prime offers a compelling opportunity for Amgen to strengthen our oncology portfolio with a promising late-stage, first-in-class global asset to treat gastric cancer,"" said Robert Bradway, chairman and chief executive at Amgen. ""We look forward to welcoming the Five Prime team to Amgen and working with them to leverage our best-in-class monoclonal antibody manufacturing capabilities to supply additional clinical materials, as well as expanded production quantities, to realize the full potential of bemarituzumab for even more patients around the world as quickly as possible.""</p>
<p>""This is an exciting day for patients who may one day benefit from the promise of bemarituzumab and our full pipeline. I'm so proud of the Five Prime team and the science we've pioneered,"" said Tom Civik, president and CEO chief of Five Prime, adding: ""We see tremendous complementarity between the two companies. Amgen has global reach, world-class resources, and they share our deep passion for science and commitment to patients. I have full confidence that Amgen is the right company to work with us to bring our innovative cancer treatments to patients and to achieve our mission to rewrite cancer,"" he noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Five Prime&rsquo;s lead asset:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Five Prime's lead asset, bemarituzumab, is a first-in-class, Phase III ready anti-FGFR2b antibody with positive data from a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study in frontline advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Bemarituzumab targets FGFR2b, which has been found to be overexpressed in approximately 30% of patients with non-HER2 positive gastric cancer, as well as other solid tumors.</li>
<li>The bemarituzumab Phase II FIGHT trial demonstrated clinically-meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) in the frontline treatment of patients with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The acquisition of Five Prime also supports Amgen's international expansion strategy. Gastric cancer is one of the world's most common forms of cancer and is particularly prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region, where Amgen expects to generate significant volume growth in the coming years. Amgen plans to leverage its presence in Japan and other Asia-Pacific markets to maximize bemarituzumab's potential.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of this transaction, Amgen will receive a royalty percentage on future net sales in Greater China ranging from the high teens to the low twenties from a pre-existing co-development and commercialization agreement between Five Prime and Zai Lab (Shanghai).</p>

<p>The guidance, developed by the UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its ACCESS partners, lays out what information the medicines regulators would need to approve any modifications to authorized COVID-19 vaccines, should virus mutations make them less effective at preventing the disease.  </p>
<p>According to the guidance, vaccine manufacturers would need to provide robust evidence that the modified vaccine produces an immune response, but time-consuming clinical studies that do not add to the regulatory understanding of a vaccine&rsquo;s safety, quality or effectiveness would not be needed. This is because researchers are now better able to measure protection by looking at antibodies in the blood following vaccination, reducing the need to wait and see whether or not people in a trial become infected with the disease. This would significantly reduce the length of time taken for the modified vaccine to be ready for use.</p>
<p>Alongside data on the immune response, the vaccine manufacturer would also be expected to provide evidence showing the modified vaccine is safe and is of the expected quality.

<h2><strong>Based on regulatory process used for seasonal flu vaccines</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;The announcement today also demonstrates the strength of our international partnerships with other regulators and how our global work can help ensure faster access to life-saving vaccines in the UK and around the world.  The public should be confident that no vaccine would be approved unless the expected high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness are met,&rdquo; he concluded. </p>

<p>The European Union applicant for this medicine is R-Pharm Germany GmbH, a subsidiary of Russia&rsquo;s R-Pharm.</p>
<p>The CHMP&rsquo;s decision to start the rolling review is based on results from laboratory studies and clinical studies in adults. These studies indicate that Sputnik V triggers the production of antibodies and immune cells that target the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and may help protect against COVID-19.</p>
<p>The EMA will evaluate data as they become available to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks. The rolling review will continue until enough evidence is available for formal marketing authorisation application.</p>
<p>The EMA will assess Sputnik V&rsquo;s compliance with the usual EU standards for effectiveness, safety and quality. While the EMA cannot predict the overall timelines, it should take less time than normal to evaluate an eventual application because of the work done during the rolling review.</p>
<p>EMA will communicate further when the marketing authorisation application for the vaccine has been submitted.</p>
<p>The Gamaleya National Center and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) cooperate with national regulatory authorities around the world and provide comprehensive data on Sputnik V clinical trials.</p>
<h2><strong>RDIF statement</strong></h2>
<p>Responding to the EMA announcement, RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev stated: &ldquo;We welcome the start of the rolling review procedure by EMA of Sputnik V. We have provided EMA with comprehensive data on the Russian vaccine. Sputnik V can make an important contribution to saving millions of lives in Europe and we are looking forward to a thorough review of data by CHMP. Vaccine partnerships should be above politics and cooperation with EMA is a perfect example demonstrating that pooling efforts is the only way to end the pandemic. Following EMA approval, we would be able to provide vaccine for 50 million Europeans starting from June 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of EU member states have made individual decisions to register Sputnik V without EMA approval. The vaccine is currently approved for use in Hungary and Slovakia, the RDIF noted.

<p>The target action date for the FDA decision is October 21, 2021 and the European Union regulatory submission for children aged 6 to 11 years with asthma is planned for first-quarter 2021.<br /> The sBLA is supported by data that include pivotal <a href=""https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-10-13-07-00-00"">Phase III results</a> evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in addition to standard-of-care maintenance therapy in children with moderate-to-severe asthma with type 2 inflammation, characterized by elevated blood eosinophil levels and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels.</p>
<p>In the trial, Dupixent significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and rapidly improved lung function within two weeks in children aged six to 11 years. Safety results were generally consistent with the well-established safety profile of Dupixent in the approved indication for patients aged 12 and older with moderate-to-severe asthma. Adverse events in the Phase III trial that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included injection site reactions, viral upper respiratory tract infections and eosinophilia. Detailed results from this Phase III trial will be published later this year.</p>","2021-03-04 15:36:00","FDA accepts Dupixent sBLA in children with asthma for review","Sanofi, Dupixent, sBLA, Review, FD, Asthma, Children","FDA accepts Dupixent sBLA in children with asthma for review",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-04 15:35:40","2021-03-05 09:49:28",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-dupixent-sbla-in-children-with-asthma-for-review,,,,,,sanofi_us_site_large.jpg,sanofi_us_site_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Respiratory and Pulmonary","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA","France, USA",Sanofi,Dupixent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

The funds will help Janux advance its pre-clinical pipeline of T-cell engager immunotherapies, with a target of reaching clinical trials next year.</p>
<p>In contrast, currently available T-cell engager therapies typically come with many toxicity issues and poor pharmacokinetic profiles, making them less safe and less effective. Janux is using TRACTr to develop drugs that target multiple solid tumor indications, including colorectal, prostrate, breast, and ovarian cancers.</p>
<p><strong>Has already attracted Merck&rsquo;s interest</strong></p>
<p>Janux&rsquo; technology &ndash; called TRACTr, short for Tumor Activated T Cell Engager technology &ndash; caught the attention of Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) late last year, resulting in a strategic <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/janux-therapeutics-selling-its-tractr-technology-in-1-billion-deal"">collaboration worth over $1 billion</a>. The technology stands out because of its ability to rapidly deliver T-cell engagers that balance high potency, efficacy, and specificity with optimal patient safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to close this financing round with a top-tier investor syndicate who recognize the potential of our TRACTr technology to engineer best-in-class T cell engagers to provide better outcomes for cancer patients,&rdquo; said David Campbell, president and chief executive of Janux Therapeutics. &ldquo;With this financing, we&rsquo;re focused on advancing our deep pipeline of T cell engager immunotherapies for the treatment of various cancers. We anticipate that the first of several development candidates will be entering the clinic next year for a solid tumor indication,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-cells are the most potent killers of tumor cells within the immune system, but directing, controlling, and integrating that activity is the key to next generation immunotherapies,&rdquo; said Jay Lichter, managing partner of Avalon Ventures, adding that &ldquo;Janux&rsquo; TRACTr technology offers the potential to balance T-cell potency with specificity with the goal of generating immunotherapies with optimal safety, efficacy, and specificity.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-04 14:09:00","Janux raises $56 million to take ‘TRACTr’ tech to the clinic","Janux Therapeutics, Financing, Series A, T-cell, Engager, TRACTr technology","Janux raises $56 million to take ‘TRACTr’ tech to the clinic",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-04 14:08:19","2021-03-04 14:16:57",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/janux-raises-56-million-to-take-tractr-tech-to-the-clinic,,,,,,money_drugs_scales_large-1-.jpg,money_drugs_scales_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Immunotherapies,Biotechnology,Immunologicals,"Business Financing, Research",USA,"Janux Therapeutics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Both doses of baricitinib, sold as Olumiant for arthritis and atopic dermatitis, met the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 36, demonstrating a statistically-significant improvement in scalp hair regrowth compared to those randomized to placebo. AA is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that can progress. Baricitinib has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AA.</p>
<p>There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for AA, a disease that affects as many as 147 million people worldwide. The sell-side forecasts Olumiant sales of $1.2 billion in 2026, according to <em>EvaluatePharma </em>consensus, but none of this is expected to come in alopecia.</p>
<p>These latest data have failed to excite the market, as Lilly&rsquo;s shares edged down 0.9% to $202.27, and Incyte was 1.7% lower at $77.11 on Wednesday.</p>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Potential to address the urgent needs&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>""These positive results are very promising and suggest that baricitinib has the potential to address the urgent needs of people living with alopecia areata,"" said Dr Brett King, professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. ""This level of high-quality research is needed to advance our understanding and the treatment of this frequently devastating disease,"" he noted.</p>
<p>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 546 adults with a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score &ge; 50 (i.e., who had &ge;50% scalp hair loss) and a current episode of severe AA lasting at least six months but no more than eight years. The study included a diverse patient population from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA.</p>
<p>Safety outcomes of baricitinib in BRAVE-AA2 were consistent with its established safety profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). No deaths, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were reported in the study.</p>
<p>""For patients who suffer from alopecia areata, it is not a cosmetic condition, it is a devastating autoimmune disease that can have significant psychological effects. They lose much more than just hair,"" said Dr Lotus Mallbris, vice president of immunology development at Lilly, adding: ""We are looking forward to sharing the totality of data from the overall clinical development program for baricitinib as a potential first-in-disease treatment for alopecia areata.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a clear unmet need in the market for more efficacious and convenient therapies, says GlobalData, a data and analytics company.</p>
<p>Current therapies mostly function as appetite-suppressors that are orally administered several times a day and often have poor efficacy. Despite some safety concerns, regarding predominately gastrointestinal adverse events, the unprecedented efficacy data from the STEP1 trial demonstrates that semaglutide has the potential to become the leading marketed therapy for obesity.</p>
<p>Akash Patel, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;With more than a third of patients losing over 20% of their body weight, these are incredibly promising results. KOLs interviewed by GlobalData have expressed a keen interest in prescribing semaglutide as it offers a highly efficacious therapeutic option for tackling obesity in patients with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D).&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Likely to cannibalize Saxenda</strong></h2>
<p>Semaglutide is already a highly prescribed GLP-1 therapy for T2D, marketed as a subcutaneous (Ozempic) and oral formulation (Rybelsus). If approved for obesity, semaglutide could rapidly cannibalize sales of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s leading obesity drug Saxenda (liraglutide), a once-daily subcutaneous GLP-1 therapy, due to its superior efficacy and dosing regimen. Transferring patients to semaglutide is likely to be a key priority for Novo Nordisk before Saxenda loses patent protection. Saxenda generated sales of around $900 million last year.</p>
<p>Fiona Chisholm, pharma analyst at GlobalData, adds: &ldquo;Political incentive to address obesity is at an all-time high, with policies such as the UK&rsquo;s Soft Drinks Industry Levy coming into effect in recent years, particularly as the link between obesity and poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients has been well publicized throughout the pandemic. The STEP1 results highlight the potential for pharma to play a greater role in tackling the obesity crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-04 11:30:00","Novo Nordisk looks set for leading position in obesity market, says an","Novo Nordisk, Semaglutide, Saxenda, Obesity, Market position, GlobalData","Novo Nordisk looks set for leading position in obesity market, says analyst",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-04 11:29:20","2021-03-04 11:37:03",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novo-nordisk-looks-set-for-leading-position-in-obesity-market-says-analyst,,,,,,novo_nordisk_big.jpg,novo_nordisk_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Obesity,Pharmaceutical,"Diabetes, Metabolics, Nutritional disorders","Drug Trial, Markets & Marketing",Denmark,"GlobalData, Novo Nordisk","Saxenda, semaglutide",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The companies first entered into a collaboration in late 2017, when Boehringer gained rights to Autifony&rsquo;s voltage gated potassium channel modulator platform, in a deal that could have been worth 627 million euros ($756 million at current exchange rates) to the British firm. However, in August last year, Boehringer decided not to exercise its option on the Kv3 program. Autifony was formed in 2011 as a spin-out from GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK).</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Autifony and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s Research Beyond Borders team will investigate a novel ion channel target involved in the function of cellular lysosomes. The new program aims to discover and develop first-in-class modulators of these channels which have the potential to treat a range of indications, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and other disorders linked to lysosomal dysfunction.</p>

<p>Under today&rsquo;s deal, Takeda has entered into an exclusive agreement under which it will secure global rights at closing from Ovid to develop and commercialize the investigational medicine soticlestat (TAK-935/OV935) for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Discovered at Takeda&rsquo;s Shonan, Japan research center, soticlestat is a potent, highly selective, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H).</p>
<p>Under the new exclusive agreement, all global rights to soticlestat have been secured by Takeda from Ovid. Takeda will assume sole responsibility for further worldwide development and commercialization, and Ovid will no longer have any financial obligation to Takeda under the original collaboration agreement, including for milestone payments or any future development and commercialization costs.</p>
<h2><strong>Deal offers $196 million upfront payment</strong></h2>
<p>Ovid will receive an upfront payment of $196 million at closing and is eligible to receive up to an additional $660 million upon achieving development, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, Ovid will receive tiered royalties beginning in the low double-digits and up to 20 percent on sales of soticlestat, if approved and commercialized. The new agreement is expected to close by end of March 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.</p>
<p>Under the 2017 collaboration agreement, Takeda received equity in Ovid and was eligible to receive up to $85 million in payments for regulatory milestones, including the initiation of Phase III clinical trials. Ovid led global development of soticlestat through the successful demonstration of proof-of-concept in multiple rare epilepsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soticlestat has emerged as an important late-stage molecule in our portfolio, which focuses predominantly on rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases with great unmet need,&rdquo; said Dr Sarah Sheikh, head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. &ldquo;We are working diligently and expediently to initiate and execute upon the Phase III studies in children and young adults with DS and LGS. Our goal is to one day bring new treatment options that provide greater seizure control, tolerability and function to DS and LGS patients around the world,&rdquo; she added.</p>","2021-03-03 17:41:00","Ovid Therapeutics rockets on news of $856 million soticlestat deal","Ovid Therapeutics, Takeda, Soticlestat, Global rights, Epilepsy, Dravet Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut","Ovid Therapeutics rockets on news of $856 million soticlestat deal",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-03 17:40:51","2021-03-03 17:54:47",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ovid-therapeutics-rockets-on-news-of-856-million-soticlestat-deal,,,,,,ovid_big.png,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Deals, Licensing, Research","Japan, USA","Ovid Therapeutics, Takeda","OV935, Soticlestat, TAK-935",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

The other one is Serum Institute of India's locally-made Oxford-AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) COVID 19 vaccine, Covishield.</p>
<p>India has vaccinated more than 10.5 million healthcare and front-line workers since beginning its immunization campaign, noted a report by Aljazeera.</p>
<p>But only 1.2 million, or about 11%, of them, have taken the locally developed COVAXIN, while the remaining 9.4 million have used the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the government&rsquo;s Co-Win online platform used to track the vaccination drive.</p>
<p>BBV152 contains a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which is produced in Vero cells. It is stable at 2&deg;C to 8&deg;C (refrigerated) and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels. BBV152 has a 28-day open vial policy as a unique product characteristic, thus reducing vaccine wastage by approximately 10-30%. BBV152 is based on an established manufacturing platform with a better safety profile when compared to other vaccine platforms. The inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant enhances T-cell immune responses to COVID-19, leading to long-term protection.</p>","2021-03-03 17:21:00","India’s first COVID-19 vaccine shows efficacy of 81% in Phase III tria","Bharat Biotec, COVAXIN, COVID-19 vaccine, Efficacy, Phase III","India’s first COVID-19 vaccine shows efficacy of 81% in Phase III trial",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-03 17:20:28","2021-03-03 17:27:35",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-shows-efficacy-of-81-in-phase-iii-trial,,,,,,covid_big.jpg,covid_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"COVID-19 vaccines",Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research",India,"Bharat Biotech",Covaxin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Today, the UK medicines cost-effectiveness watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended US pharma major Eli Lilly&rsquo;s (NYSE: LLY) Olumiant (baricitinib) as an option for treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults if the disease has not responded to at least one systemic immunosuppressant, such as ciclosporin, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, or these are not suitable. As part of a confidential commercial agreement, the NHS will receive baricitinib at a discounted price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lilly welcomes this decision from NICE which will give doctors and their patients a much-needed new treatment option.

<p>The gene therapy has been approved in the European Union and the UK for transfusion-dependent &beta;-thalassemia (TDT), but the NICE is currently recommending against routine National Health Service (NHS) funding.</p>
<h2>'Dangerous precedent' for other gene therapies</h2>
<p>US biotech bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE), the company behind Zynteglo, claims that NICE&rsquo;s stance threatens the future of gene therapies in the UK, despite the government&rsquo;s clear commitment to bring these transformative treatments to patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are shocked and disappointed by this recommendation and strongly believe that NICE has failed to act in the best interests of people with TDT and their families in England and Wales,&rdquo; said Nicola Redfern, UK general manager at bluebird bio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is baffling that NICE disregarded the testimonies of patients, advocacy groups and clinicians and, despite recognizing beti-cel as a potential cure for patients with TDT, has chosen to deny access and has dismissed the obvious unmet need. This decision is deeply concerning and will not only come as a huge blow to the TDT community, but also sets a dangerous precedent which could limit access to other gene therapies in the UK in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TIF has submitted a commentary on the NICE&acute;s consultation document, referring to Zynteglo as a potentially life-saving and long-awaited treatment.</p>
<h2>Potential to influence other health authorities across the world</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The consultation makes no reference to allowing patients the possibility to choose to undergo gene therapy treatment, but leaves all with an unqualified denial of support,&rdquo; the TIF statement says. &ldquo;It is noted that in the absence until now of any other curative treatment, the only available option for many patients with TDT who wish to be cured is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a far more dangerous procedure that carries many and multiple risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federation also expresses its vivid concerns that any respective decisions made by NICE and the NHS on the Zynteglo gene therapy may further influence opinions and decisions of other health authorities across the world, particularly those that may lack national health technology assessment bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our submission that in the current climate and growing sensitivity to health inequalities, the NICE&rsquo;s guidance should be carefully reviewed, and while we recognize that there are complex considerations at play, we sincerely hope that these do not impact the prospects of patients with thalassaemia in the UK of benefiting from cutting-edge treatments.&rdquo;</p>","2021-03-03 15:25:00",,"Zynteglo, health, NICE, gene, patients, national, bluebird, recommendation, federation, thalassaemia, stance, funding, group, Patient, echoes, snub, issuin","The Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) has objected to the UK´s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issuing of a negative recommend",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-03 14:26:47","2021-03-03 15:28:30",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/patient-group-echoes-bluebird-bio-stance-over-zynteglo-uk-funding-snub,,,,,,money_drugs_scales_large-1-.jpg,money_drugs_scales_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology","Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access","UK, USA","bluebird bio",Zynteglo,,,,,,"Thalassaemia International Federation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Based on technology discovered at the University of California-san Francisco (UCSF) by Mitokinin co-founders Nicholas Hertz and Kevan Shokat, Mitokinin moved into MBC BioLabs San Francisco in September 2017 with Series A funding from a syndicate led by Mission BioCapital that included Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitokinin's novel PINK1 compounds selectively increase the activity of PINK1, a master regulator of mitochondrial quality control that is genetically linked to Parkinson's disease. By increasing PINK1 activity, Mitokinin aims to address the mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and progression.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Mitokinin will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and will continue developing its PINK1 activator program through completion of IND enabling studies for Mitokinin's lead compound.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Another throw of the PD dice</strong></h2>
<p>The deal with Mitokinin is AbbVie&rsquo;s second try in the Parkinson&rsquo;s sector. However, in June last year it walked away from a February2019 collaboration with Voyager Therapeutics (Nasdaq: VYGR), shedding a gene therapy for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s and vectorized antibodies for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, respectively. That deal that could have been worth $1.5 billion to Voyager, albeit with just $65 million upfront.</p>

<p>Shares in the firm slumped 7% on Tuesday, following the announcement that the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial had not been met.</p>
<p>In a statement, Neurocrine said the study did meet secondary endpoints of cognitive assessment, and that these would &ldquo;merit further clinical evaluation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The candidate is under co-development with Japan&rsquo;s largest drugmaker, Takeda Pharmaceutical (TYO: 4502), under the terms of an up to $2 billion deal on CNS disorders agreed in mid-2020.</p>
<p>The firms are working together to develop and commercialize compounds in Takeda&rsquo;s early-to-mid-stage psychiatry pipeline, including three clinical stage assets for schizophrenia, treatment-resistant depression and anhedonia.</p>
<h2>Luvadaxistat</h2>
<p>Luvadaxistat is a potential first-in-class oral therapy, a selective inhibitor which targets glutamate, an abundant neurotransmitter in the brain.</p>
<p>There had been a considerable amount of interest in the approach, which was hoped to provide a new way to combat ""negative symptoms"" of the condition, such as lack of communication and motivation.</p>
<p>The poor data will further dampen hopes that this new class of drug can achieve that, however, after Concert Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: CNCE) announced negative results for its candidate, CTP-692, which employs a similar approach.</p>
<p>Concert saw its shares fall by around 40% in early February, after it announced a Phase II study of CTP-692 did not meet the primary endpoint or other secondary endpoints.</p>
<p>Neurocrine does not look ready to drop its program altogether though, stating that the full results from the study would be evaluated in order to determine next steps.</p>
<p>Chief medical officer Eiry Roberts said the firm was &ldquo;encouraged that secondary endpoints assessing cognitive performance within the trial were met and that treatment emergent adverse events reported were consistent with previous luvadaxistat studies.""</p>

<p><strong>Symbicort US patent trial</strong></p>
<p>In October 2018, AstraZeneca initiated litigation against Mylan, which is now operating under the name Viatris (NYSE: VTRS) following the merger with Pfizer&rsquo;s Upjohn unit, and subsequently against 3M Company (3M) asserting infringement of various US patents covering Symbicort. In July 2020, Kindeva was added as a defendant in the action. 3M was voluntarily dismissed from the case.</p>
<p>In September 2020, Mylan and Kindeva stipulated to patent infringement to the extent that the asserted patent claims were found to be valid and enforceable, but reserved the right to seek a vacatur of the stipulation if the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reverses or modifies the District Court&rsquo;s claim construction.

<p>The Plymouth Meeting, USA-based company is developing the DNA-based vaccine for the treatment of three HPV-16-/18-related diseases &ndash; cervical dysplasia, vulvar dysplasia and anal dysplasia.</p>
<p>Inovio said the trial met primary and secondary endpoints &ldquo;among all evaluable subjects.""</p>
<p>This means the firm excluded eight patients for whom endpoint data were not available, creating a modified intention to treat (mITT) population against which to judge the success of the trial.</p>
<p>Statistical significance was not reached in the full intention to treat (ITT) population, which considers such patients as non-responders.</p>
<p>The uncertainty will ramp up pressure on a sister study, REVEAL 2, to show the future potential of the candidate as a replacement for surgical intervention. That trial is currently still enrolling.</p>
<p>The results do however represent an important proof-of-concept for the company&rsquo;s platform, raising hopes for continued success down the line.</p>
<p>Inovio had previously been focused on cancer vaccines, but in 2019 pivoted away from oncology to focus on HPV-related conditions, citing an overly competitive commercial landscape.</p>
<p>The company also slashed its workforce by more than a quarter at that time.</p>
<h2>Biomarker development</h2>
<p>Inovio has been working with Dutch molecular diagnostics company Qiagen (NYSE: QGEN) to develop an<em> in-vitro</em> diagnostic, based on RNA sequencing technology, to identify treatment candidates for VGX-3100.</p>
<p>If the firm is successful in gaining regulatory approval for its approach, these efforts will likely be crucial to its level of impact, with analysts forecasting peak sales of up to $400 million.</p>
<p>Chief executive Joseph Kim said: ""We expect VGX-3100, if approved, to be an important therapeutic option for those impacted by HPV-16-/18-related disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Allschwil-based firm believes the drug, which works by blocking the activity of the neuropeptide orexin, could help extend sleep and improve daytime functioning for adults who suffer from the condition.</p>
<p>Importantly, the company hopes to improve on the safety profile of existing options, a key aspect of insomnia research given risks stemming from impairment to daytime functioning.</p>
<p>Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) and Eisai (TYO: 4523) already market orexin blockers - Belsomra (suvorexant) and Dayvigo (lemborexant) - but both have box warnings regarding the impact on daytime functioning, including the ability to drive motor vehicles.</p>
<p>Neither are currently approved in Europe, providing Idorsia with the chance to make a breakthrough in the region.</p>
<p>Seltorexant, another candidate in this class under development by Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) pharma arm Janssen and Minerva&nbsp;Neurosciences, is still in mid-stage development.</p>
<h2>Daridorexant development</h2>
<p>Idorsia&rsquo;s lead compound, daridorexant, now boasts positive results from two pivotal studies, and the company is actively preparing for launch, in anticipation of regulatory approval.</p>
<p>In late 2020, the firm conducted a rights offering to raise over $600 million, money which is earmarked for regulatory activities and commercial launch of the product.</p>
<p>The firm has already submitted to the US FDA for approval, and the company anticipates launching in the US in the first half of 2022 if all goes well.</p>
<p>Chief executive Jean-Paul Clozel said the submission was &ldquo;an indication of our commitment to transform the treatment of insomnia around the globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Most of the current treatment options are acting on the brain in a non-specific way, with restrictions due to safety concerns.

<p>Novartis&rsquo; (NOVN: VX) inclisiran, Esperion Therapeutics&rsquo; (Nasdaq: ESPR) Nexletol (bempedoic acid) and the same company&rsquo;s Nexlizet (bempedoic acid/ezetimibe) were assessed for their comparative clinical effectiveness and value for treating heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).</p>
<h2>'Impressive new treatment options'</h2>
<p>Steven Pearson, the ICER's president, said that the innovation of recent years had produced impressive new treatment options for patients with high cholesterol, given the substantial unmet need and the potential impact on population health. But he expressed concern over the potential price tag being impressive as well.</p>
<p>""That's why it's so important to provide a choice among multiple treatment options for patients with diverse needs, and to ensure that patients and the health system can afford these treatments,&rdquo; Dr Pearson said.</p>
<p>""We saw this opportunity squandered in the early years of PCSK9 inhibitors. The only way we get this right for patients moving forward is to price new treatments to their demonstrated clinical value, and link that to responsible insurance coverage criteria that are based on evidence and informed by input from clinical experts and patients.""</p>
<p><span class=""il"">ICER</span>'s report on these therapies was reviewed at the February public meeting of one of its&nbsp;three independent evidence appraisal committees.</p>
<h2>'Patients deserve better'</h2>
<p>The ICER's recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) for bempedoic acid/ezetimibe is approximately $1,600 to $2,600 per year, a range that would require a 36% to 60% discount off the treatment's current wholesale acquisition cost.</p>
<p>While inclisiran's price is not yet known, the ICER's HBPB range for inclisiran for the broad population of likely eligible patients is between $3,600 to $6,000 per year.</p>
<p>The HBPB is the top price range at which a health system can reward innovation and better health for patients without doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>Dr Pearson added: ""Unfortunately, as the independent appraisal committee confirmed, current pricing for bempedoic acid is too high to get the ball rolling in the right direction. We'll have to wait to see what the price will be for inclisiran, but it would be a real loss for patients if at the outset of another round of new innovation, drugmakers set prices that send us right back into another grinding number of years in which access is limited while drugmakers and insurers wrestle over what is viewed as an unreasonable price.

<p>With its partner the Serum Institute of India, the Anglo-Swedish drug major says it will become the biggest supplier to COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to vaccines for the novel coronavirus for all countries, regardless of income levels, which is led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</p>
<p>First COVAX shipments were dispatched late last week to Ghana and Cote D&rsquo;Ivoire, and more are due to begin arriving this week in countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Fiji, Mongolia and Moldova. This supply represents the first COVID-19 vaccine for many of these countries.</p>

<p>Further shipments will arrive in the coming weeks with the aim of supplying a total of 142 countries with hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine in the coming months. The majority of these doses, manufactured by AstraZeneca and its licence partner Serum Institute of India, will go to low and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, said: &ldquo;Global, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines is only possible when the public and private sectors work together. When we launched the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment in June 2020, our first agreement was with AstraZeneca. Nine months later, the first doses are already being delivered to those that need them most.

<p>According to them, one of the major reasons for the ongoing shortage of drugs is failure of their procurements, which is observed both on federal and regional levels. The shortage is observed in the case of various drugs, including those that can be prescribed for the treatment of some serious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis and some others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Ravil Niyazov, a specialist in the development and regulation of drugs at the Russian Scientific Consulting Center, said in an interview with the Russian-language Meduza business paper, in addition to low prices and the existing restrictions on the participation of foreign drugmakers during state tenders in Russia, a number of existing regulatory barriers continue to prevent more active launch of drugs both by domestic and foreign drugmakers in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Excessive registration requirements</strong></h2>
<p>According to Mr Niyazov, these barriers are primarily in the form of excessive registration requirements, some of which have protectionist origin, providing protection for domestic drugmakers. These requirements prevent more active launch of foreign drugs in the Russian market, despite the fact that the expansion of the range of original drugs in Russia may speed the launch of their domestic analogues in the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form and came as a surprise to analysts and investors.</p>
<p>In the CRL, the FDA indicated its concern of safety risk to patients in terms of an increase in neutropenia-related sequelae on the oral paclitaxel arm compared with the IV paclitaxel arm.</p>
<p>The FDA also expressed concerns regarding the uncertainty over the results of the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) at week 19 conducted by blinded independent central review (BICR). The agency stated that the BICR reconciliation and re-read process may have introduced unmeasured bias and influence on the BICR.</p>
<h2><strong>FDA requests new trial</strong></h2>
<p>The agency recommended that Athenex conduct a new adequate and well-conducted clinical trial in a patient population with metastatic breast cancer representative of the population in the USA. The agency determined that additional risk mitigation strategies to improve toxicity, which may involve dose optimization and/or exclusion of patients deemed to be at higher risk of toxicity, are required to support potential approval of the NDA.</p>
<p>Athenex plans to request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the agency&rsquo;s response, engage in a dialogue on the design and scope of a clinical trial to address the FDA&rsquo;s requirements and align on the next steps required to obtain approval.</p>

<p>The approval is for patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one CD38-directed monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p>Oncopeptides expects Pepaxto to become commercially available in the USA within around two weeks.</p>
<h2><strong>First anticancer peptide-drug conjugate OKed for MM</strong></h2>
<p>Pepaxto is the first anticancer peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) approved in multiple myeloma. Pepaxto is a first in class PDC that targets aminopeptidases and rapidly releases alkylating agents into tumor cells. While there have been improvements in the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma in recent years, patients often build resistance to treatments over time, creating a demand for new and innovative treatment options. The number of patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma is growing and the number of cases diagnosed annually is expected to almost double in 20 years. There is currently no cure.</p>
<p>Marty Duvall, chief executive at Oncopeptides commented: ""The accelerated US approval of Pepaxto is a key step forward in fulfilling Oncopeptides' core mission, to bring hope to patients in their battle against difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. Moving ahead, our focus is to further advance Pepaxto. We look forward to receiving top-line data from the Phase III OCEAN study in the second quarter. This comparative study is designed to support a future supplementary New Drug Application to expand the label.""</p>

<p>Despite the fact that in 2014 the Russian Federal Service for Intellectual Property (Rospatent) postponed the end of the protection of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s insulin from 2024 to 2028 in the Russian market, Geropharm still has plans to launch its biosimilar of Tresiba (insulin degludec), reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s localcorrespondent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2020, the Russian company demanded to recognize the actions of Rospatent as illegal and oblige it to cancel the prolongation of a patent for Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s insulin, however these claims were rejected by the Russian Intellectual Property Court on January 2021. At present this ultra-long-acting drug (more than 42 hours) is represented in the market by Tresiba and, in combination with ultra-short-acting insulin, Ryzodeg (insulin degludec + insulin aspart), being registered in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Could mean drugmakers won&rsquo;t be able to introduce biosimilars for several years</strong></p>
<p>The latest decision of the court means that other manufacturers, including Geropharm will not be able to bring its biosimilars of insulin degludec to the market for at least the next several years. Geropharm, however, reported about its plans to challenge the legality of Rospatent's actions.</p>

<p>Incentives worth $944 million are to be given over nine years beginning with the current financial year. The government approved 14 projects belonging to two different categories for manufacturing APIs.</p>
<p>As India's Department of Pharmaceuticals launched the PLI scheme on February 24, that encourages setting up greenfield plants with minimum domestic value addition in four different target segments - two in fermentation based with at least 90% and two in chemical synthesis based with minimum 70% - the government has already cleared five applications under Target Segment I which involves a committed investment of $511.58 million. The outlay of the PLI-2 scheme is packed with incentives worth $2.07 billion to be disbursed during 2020-21 to 2029-30.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Category 1 comprises biopharmaceuticals; complex generic drugs; patented drugs or drugs nearing patent expiry; cell based or gene therapy drugs; orphan drugs; complex excipients and phyto-pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Under Target Segment II which focuses on fermentation-based niche KSMs (key starting materials)/drug intermediates/APIs), the government has cleared eight applications, including those from Natural Biogenex, Symbiotec Pharmalab, Macleods Pharmaceutical, Sudarshan Pharma Industries and Optimus Drugs.</p>
<p>Under Target Segment III, which focuses on chemical synthesis based KSMs (key starting materials)/drug intermediates, the government has cleared six applications, including those from Saraca Laboratories, Emmennar Pharma, Hindys Lab, AartiSpeciality Chemicals, Meghmani and that of Sadhana Nitro Chem.</p>
<p>Category 3 comprises repurposed drugs; auto immune drugs, anti-cancer drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, anti-infective drugs, cardiovascular drugs, psychotropic drugs and anti-retroviral drugs.</p>
<p>With this, a total of 19 applications have been approved by the government.</p>
<h2><strong>Seeking global engagement</strong></h2>
<p>Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the focus of the scheme is to get global champions to India and to make national champions out of local manufacturers. The PLI scheme will incentivize the global and domestic players to engage in high value production, he added.</p>
<p>The rate of incentive will be 10% (of incremental sales value) for Category 1 and Category 2 products for the first four years, 8% for the fifth year and 6% for the sixth year of production under the scheme.</p>
<p>Major investments by global private equity giants such as Advent, Carlyle and KKR in India's contract manufacturing organization sector, amid the pandemic, had reflected the solid prospects for growth in the country's complex generics and bulk drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>Analysts have pointed out that the increasing focus on the pharma manufacturing sector, both due to the pandemic and a renewed focus on 'Make in India,' has got the government rushing in to fulfil its obligation by overhauling its pharma regulatory norms and expediting approval process to promote innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that India is now focused on developing novel therapies and vaccines on account of the COVID-19 situation, the move is expected to not only remove unnecessary procedural roadblocks but also foster innovation and help attract larger structured investments.</p>
<p>Noting that the Indian pharma industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 11% in the domestic market and more than 16% in exports over the last two decades, a report by EY notes that the overall growth has been driven by the industry's leadership in supplying generic formulations to markets across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2020-2030 period, it is envisaged that the Indian pharma industry will grow at a CAGR of more than 12% to reach $130 billion by 2030 from $41.7 billion in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Welcome change</strong></h2>
<p>The scheme has been hailed by industry experts, many of whom have termed it a welcome change from the earlier PLI scheme, and because 35%-40% of existing brownfield API units capacity need to be utilized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some 20 molecules can be manufactured by synthetic chemistry within a period of two to three months, state experts. This can be done considering the fact that the earlier PLI scheme announced in July 2020 is expected to take a minimum of two years to become fruitful. Fermentation based units alone will take three-four years as setting up of greenfield units generally entails a time of two years.</p>
<p>To ensure effective participation of the industry, the Department of Pharmaceuticals introduced some revisions to the PLI-1 scheme. by removing the minimum investment criteria and incorporating export and sale-based production criteria following an appeal by drug industries.</p>
<p>As per the revised guidelines of PLI-1 scheme for boosting indigenous production of 41 products which cover all the identified 53 APIs for which India is critically dependent on China, the criteria of 'minimum threshold' investment have been replaced by 'committed investment' by the selected applicant. The change has been made to encourage efficient use of productive capital as the amount of investment required to achieve a particular level of production depends upon choice of technology.</p>
<p>The provision which restricts the sales of eligible products to domestic sales only for the purpose of eligibility to receive incentives has been deleted, bringing the scheme in line with other PLI schemes and encouraging market diversification.</p>
<p>A change has also been made in the minimum annual production capacity for 10 products - tetracycline, neomycin, para&ndash;amino phenol (PAP), meropenem, artesunate, losartan, telmisartan, acyclovir, ciprofloxacin and aspirin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nithya Balasubramanian, director, Sanford Bernstein, stated the PLI scheme is expected to be a kicker to the API industry. Stating that the biggest challenge for Indian companies has been their ability to match the scale that Chinese companies have built over the last several years, the official said, the PLI scheme could level the playing field.</p>
<p>Experts note the scheme is set to ensure a shift to India from China as the main source of API supply. In most products, there is a 15%-20% price difference between Chinese API and India APIs. The incentives will reduce that differential, they point out.</p>","2021-03-01 18:08:00","Indian government expedites approval process to promote pharma innovat","India, Government, Incentives, Manufacturing, APIs, Intermediates, Investment","Indian government expedites approval process to promote pharma innovationI",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-01 18:05:17","2021-03-01 18:17:11",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/indian-government-expedites-approval-process-to-promote-pharma-innovation,,,,,,gateway-of-india-big.jpg,gateway-of-india-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Generics,"All therapy areas","Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Production, Research",India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The 2020 Generic Market Review provides a comprehensive overview of generic medicine policies in 22 European countries. It covers pricing systems, control of excessive spending, retail tendering, hospital tendering, reimbursement systems, physician incentives, pharmacist incentives and patient incentives.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""The report clearly shows the need for pricing and reimbursement and procurement reforms""</span>Medicines for Europe represents the continent&rsquo;s generic and biosimilar medicines manufacturers.</p>
<p>Its director general Adrian van den Hoven said: &ldquo;The report clearly shows the need for pricing and reimbursement and procurement reforms in order to expand patient access, promote sustainable uptake of generic medicines and increase security of supply. Unsustainable medicines policies, like unpredictable clawback policies and price cuts, have to be avoided at all cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tender reforms, pricing and reimbursement reforms and greater use of generic medicines are essential to ensure patients can access the medicines they need and to enhance healthcare sustainability, according to Medicines for Europe.

<p>Teon is developing a focused portfolio of small molecules that modulate metabolic signalling pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Just last month, Teon announced the completion of a $30 million Series A financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the clinical development partnership, Cancer Research UK will sponsor the first-in-human Phase I/II clinical trial of TT-702, which will be led by a team at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TT-702 targets cancer&rsquo;s ability to evade the human immune response, enabling the immune system to expose and then destroy cancer cells. The hope is that TT-702 could be used to treat patients with advanced hard-to-treat solid tumors, including metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, which is an aggressive form of cancer which has progressed despite surgery and hormone therapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s Centre for Drug Development will work closely with Teon throughout the collaboration and share clinical insights as they emerge to help guide TT-702&rsquo;s future development strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Terms of the accord</strong></h2>
<p>Teon retains the rights to further develop and commercialize TT-702 and will receive the results of the clinical trial from Cancer Research UK in return for undisclosed success-based milestone and royalty payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The application is supported by replicated results from the Japanese registration program which consisted of two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies assessing the efficacy and safety of clazosentan in reducing vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality events in adult Japanese patients following aSAH.</p>
<p>Dr Satoshi Tanaka, president of Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Japan, commented: &ldquo;The development of clazosentan has taken many years to bring us to the filing of an NDA and we were very fortunate to not be held back by the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

<p>Unlike other countries, the UK has broken with the tested administration schedule of the vaccine, recommending a longer 12-week gap between doses.</p>
<p>Since it became the first country to approve the vaccine, the UK has rolled out vaccinations rapidly, covering nearly a third of its population by the end of February.</p>
<p>In addition, with a centralized public healthcare system and a strong track record of collecting health data for research purposes, the UK is well-placed to provide valuable insights into the impact of vaccines and other interventions.</p>

<p>Belzutifan (MK-6482), a treatment developed by US pharma giant Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD in the UK, for adults with von Hippel Lindau disease (a rare genetic disorder that causes cancer) has been awarded the first &lsquo;Innovation Passport&rsquo; by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC).</p>
<p>The UK scheme means patients could benefit much sooner from this treatment and it will be accelerated through the approval process; the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP).</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-mhra-innovative-licensing-and-access-pathway-is-open-for-business"">Launched in January this year</a>, the ILAP combines the MHRA&rsquo;s globally recognized high standards of quality and safety with improved flexibility to reduce the time it takes innovative treatments to be available to National Health Service patients.</p>
<p>Medicines developed through the ILAP will have more focus on patient engagement than ever before. By incorporating patient views, both on the benefits and risks of medicines in the pathway, and on how to improve patient outcomes throughout the product lifecycle, medicines can be developed to meet patient requirements more successfully.</p>
<h2><strong>Aims to encourage approval applications post-Brexit</strong></h2>
<p>Since its final departure from the European end-2020, UK medicines approvals are no longer dependent on the European Medicines Agency, and the new scheme aims to assure drugmakers about making additional investments to gain UK approvals.</p>
<p>The conventional approach requires all data from clinical trials to be complete before a drug can be cleared for use. Under the new access pathway, drug companies will be able to submit data on a rolling basis as it becomes available &mdash; the same approach that allowed Britain to approve the BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines in December, noted the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The award of this designation celebrates another first: the successful partnership between the MHRA, NICE and the SMC in making effective joint decisions and awarding Innovation Passports to products that will benefit patients.</p>
<p>The Innovation Passport is the first step in the ILAP and is open to developers of a wide range of medicines, including medicines for rare diseases, repurposed medicines and Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. Since launch, companies have submitted 10 applications.</p>
<p>In July 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to belzutifan for the treatment of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated RCC with non-metastatic RCC tumors smaller than 3 cm in size unless immediate surgery is required.&nbsp;</p>","2021-03-01 10:36:00","UK awards first ‘Innovation Passport’ to support development of cuttin","MHRA, Innovation passport, Access pathway, ILAP, Merck & Co, Belzutifan, Hippel-Lindau disease","UK awards first ‘Innovation Passport’ to support development of cutting-edge medicines",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-02-28 15:23:33","2021-03-01 10:36:44",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uk-awards-first-innovation-passport-to-support-development-of-cutting-edge-medicines,,,,,,mhra_large.png,mhra_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Genetics, Rare diseases","Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation","UK, USA","Merck & Co",belzutifan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The document opens a bidding process for hiring investors interested in participating in the construction of a new complex of the Immunobiological Technology Institute of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz), in Santa Cruz, in Rio de Janeiro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio-Manguinhos director/Fiocruz, Maur&iacute;cio Zuma, said he was thrilled with the event, remembering that the Institute has reached this moment after going a long way of studies, meetings, and a lot of dedication.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We are clear and convinced of the strategic role that Bio-Manguinhos plays for the country. Brazil has imported a large number of biopharmaceuticals for several diseases. Our challenge, the challenge for all Fiocruz, is to overcome this dependence, which will be another great achievement for the institution. In this way, we will be able to fully meet all the SUS (Brazilian Public Health System) demands and still export vaccines whenever our assistance is required&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fiocruz president, N&iacute;sia Trindade Lima, also emphasized the many shortcomings of the Brazilian health system in the technological area and noted that Cibs will make an important contribution to reducing this problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cibs points not only to the present needs, such as those of the pandemic but mostly to the future, to the next challenges that the country will face in health. With this undertaking, the country takes a fundamental step to guarantee its autonomy in the immunobiological production&rdquo;, she said.</p>
<h2><strong>CIBS in the Public Health System </strong></h2>
<p>The project will be the largest center for the production of biological products in Latin America and one of the most modern in the world. Thus, Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz will be able to increase the production capacity of vaccines and biopharmaceuticals four-fold - a number that may be even greater depending on the product mix - in order to give priority to the Brazilian population demands through the Public Health System (SUS).</p>
<p>For the project to be built, the investment will take place within a modality considered innovative within the federal government scope, called Built to Suit. Under this model, the financing will be private, paid in the form of rent, and with the equity reversion after the 15-year term. The investment is of the order of 3.4 billion real ($610 million) and foresees the generation of 5,000 direct jobs in this stage of works and 1,500 jobs for the operation of the enterprise.</p>","2021-03-01 10:29:00","Fiocruz and MoH plan largest vaccine factory in LatAm","Fiocruz, Health Ministry, Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Production, Immunological, Vaccines, Latin America","Fiocruz and MoH plan largest vaccine factory in LatAm",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-01 10:27:59","2021-03-01 10:36:04",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fiocruz-and-moh-plan-largest-vaccine-factory-in-latam,,,,,,brazil-big.jpg,brazil-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,Vaccines,"Focus On, Government Affairs, Production","Brazil, South America",Fiocruz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
487893,,"FDA green lights first treatment for molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A","The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Nulibry (fosdenopterin) for injection to reduce the risk of death due to molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a rare, genetic, metabolic disorder that typically presents in the first few days of life, causing intractable seizures, brain injury and death.","<p>The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Nulibry (fosdenopterin) for injection to reduce the risk of death due to molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a rare, genetic, metabolic disorder that typically presents in the first few days of life, causing intractable seizures, brain injury and death.</p>
<p>The FDA granted the approval of Nulibry to Origin Biosciences, an affiliate of BridgeBio Pharma (Nasdaq: BBIO), whose shares gained 8.5% to $70.68 on the news. The FDA accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for fosdenopterin (previously BBP-870/ORGN001) in September 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action marks the first FDA approval for a therapy to treat this devastating disease,&rdquo; said Dr Hylton Joffe, director of the Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine in the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. &ldquo;The FDA remains committed to facilitating the development and approval of safe and effective therapies for patients affected by rare diseases - an area of critical need,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>Patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A experience severe and rapidly progressive neurologic damage including intractable seizures, feeding difficulties and muscle weakness from the accumulation of toxic sulfite metabolites in the central nervous system. Most patients die in early childhood from infections. Before today&rsquo;s approval, the only treatment options included supportive care and therapies directed towards the complications arising from the disease, the FDA noted.</p>","2021-03-01 10:17:00","FDA green lights first treatment for molybdenum cofactor deficiency Ty","Origin Biosciences, BridgeBio Pharma, Nulibry, Fosdenopterin, FDA, Approval,

<p>The Order is focused on semiconductors, key minerals and materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced batteries. As far as pharma is concerned, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the heads of appropriate agencies, to submit a report identifying risks in the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients and policy recommendations to address these risks, within 100 days.</p>
<p>According to the AAM, the Executive Order is a prudent, considered approach to fully understanding the scope and capacity of current US pharmaceutical manufacturing, while identifying specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted for resolution both immediately with the COVID-19 pandemic and longer-term as the country prepares for future public health challenges.</p>
<p>The trade group says that the US government plays a critical role in encouraging the conditions that support domestic manufacturing of essential medicines. The AAM believes that additional incentives, such as those included in it is own <a href=""https://accessiblemeds.org/blueprint"">Blueprint for Enhancing the Security of the U.S. Pharmaceutical Supply Chain</a>, will be necessary as the USA seeks to increase its role in the global pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>
<p>AAM member companies, which currently employ around 52,000 American workers manufacturing more than 60 billion generic doses annually at 149 facilities across the country, believe that with the right incentives in place, even more American workers can contribute to a secure US supply chain, the AAM concludes.</p>","2021-03-01 10:16:00","AAM backs President Biden’s Supply Chain Executive Order","AAM, President Biden, Executive Order, Supply chain, Access, Security","AAM backs President Biden’s Supply Chain Executive Order",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-02-27 14:54:51","2021-03-01 10:16:19",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/aam-backs-president-biden-s-supply-chain-executive-order,,,,,,aam-large.png,aam-small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Pharmaceutical supply chain","Biosimilars, Generics","All therapy areas","Biden administration, Focus On, Government Affairs, Markets & Marketing",USA,,,,,,,,"US Association for Accessible Medicines",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Results from the NAVIGATOR trial show a statistically-significant and clinically meaningful-reduction in symptoms, compared to placebo, when added to standard of care.</p>
<p>The data, which were presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Asthma Allergy &amp; Immunology, will form the basis of forthcoming regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>After one year, adding the medicine to standard of care resulted in a 56% reduction in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER), regardless of the baseline eosinophil counts.</p>
<h2>Tezepelumab development</h2>
<p>While existing biologics in this area tend to target people who have asthma with eosinophilia - a high level of white blood cells - Astra and Amgen hope to differentiate their option by targeting the equally common non-eosinophilic form of the disease.</p>
<p>The firms are also pursuing a relatively unique approach, with only Novartis (NOVN: VX) working on a candidate with the same mechanism of action. That candidate, CSJ117, is still in mid-stage development.</p>
<p>Leading alternatives currently on the market include Sanofi&rsquo;s (Euronext: SAN) Dupixent (dupilumab), Roche (ROG: SIX) and Novartis&rsquo; Xolair (omalizumab) and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Fasenra (benralizumab).</p>
<p>Despite the crowded field, the market opportunity for tezepelumab is significant, given the size of the patient population.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the firms&rsquo; 2012 collaboration agreement, AstraZeneca is leading on development of the biologic, and will share in the profits should it reach the market.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Andrew Menzies-Gow called the results &ldquo;ground-breaking,&rdquo; given that many patients &ldquo;continue to face debilitating symptoms despite receiving standard of care inhaled medicines and currently approved biologics.""</p>
<p>He added: ""Tezepelumab has the potential to transform treatment for a broad population of patients with severe asthma regardless of their type of inflammation, including those with and without an eosinophilic phenotype.""</p>","2021-03-01 09:46:00",,"asthma, biologic, tezepelumab, first-in-class, results, trial, Amgen, AstraZeneca, severe, treatment, change, treated, developed, Full, Phase, breakthrough","Full results from a Phase III trial of tezepelumab, a first-in-class biologic developed by Amgen and AstraZeneca, raise hopes for a breakthrough in the treatmen",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-03-01 09:45:40","2021-03-01 10:25:50",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/first-in-class-biologic-could-change-the-way-asthma-is-treated,,,,,,astrazeneca_big.jpg,astrazeneca_small-1.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Respiratory and Pulmonary","Deals, Drug Trial, Licensing, Research","UK, USA","Amgen, AstraZeneca","Dupixent, Fasenra, tezepelumab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
