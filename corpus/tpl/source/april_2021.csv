<p>If approved, the firms will be able to offer the coronavirus vaccine for children aged 12 to 15, with Phase III data showing the therapy is safe and effective for this age group.</p>
<p>Pfizer and BioNTech said they plan to request additional amendments with other regulatory authorities worldwide.</p>

<p>Kloxxado contains twice as much naloxone per spray as Emergent BioSolutions&rsquo; (NYSE: EBS), Narcan Nasal Spray 4mg in a ready-to-use nasal spray to reverse the effects of opioid overdose, providing an important new treatment option in addressing the opioid epidemic, noted Hikma, which was found in Jordan in 1978, and said it expects Kloxxado to become available in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>Drug overdose, including most commonly opioid overdose, has been described as the ""leading cause of accidental death"" in the US today - a situation that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

488504,,"Advances in the pharmacological treatment of rare multiple sclerosis variants","Rare forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit certain atypical imaging characteristics that are absent in typical MS, although the clinical features of these variants are similar to typical MS.","<p><strong>By Dr Nicola Davies</strong></p>
<p>Rare forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit certain atypical imaging characteristics that are absent in typical MS, although the clinical features of these variants are similar to typical MS. Although the rarity of these diseases restricts the research and development of disease-specific therapies, some progress has been made. In this exclusive article, Dr Davies investigates this progress.</p>
<h2><strong>Tumefactive MS</strong></h2>
<p>Patients with this condition typically present with large tumor-like lesions. The first-line treatment for this condition is corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone, although plasma exchange has been shown to be effective in some cases. In patients with severe clinical deficits who did not respond to either of these treatments, cyclophosphamide has been found to be effective and well-tolerated.<sup>1</sup> In contrast, in a recent case report of a patient with both tumefactive and Marburg-type lesions, immunosuppression with high doses of cyclophosphamide controlled the disease for only seven months.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term treatment consists of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) used in typical MS, such as glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. However, natalizumab and fingolimod have been reported to worsen lesions and so should be avoided.<sup>2</sup> Glatiramer acetate has been found to be effective in the short term, but not in the long run.<sup>3</sup> Indeed, for this condition, the use of DMTs for preventing a relapse remains highly debated. According to various experts, DMT use is dependent on the following risk factors: age at disease onset, history of a disabling first attack, enhancement pattern, and presence of typical MS lesions.</p>
<p>To improve prognosis, stronger immunosuppressive strategies, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, need to be evaluated. Additionally, risk assessment of relapse needs to be improved for enabling quick decisions regarding the best course of treatment, including the need for DMTs.<sup>2</sup></p>
<h2><strong>Balo&rsquo;s concentric sclerosis (BCS)</strong></h2>
<p>This condition is characterized by concentric patterns of demyelinated regions alternating with undamaged myelin. Therapies include corticosteroids, plasma exchange, immunoglobulin, and drugs such as cyclophosphamide.<sup>4</sup> A 2020 report on eight patients with BCS suggests this condition is heterogenous. Clinicians might need to consider the radiological features of the disease and response to immunotherapies in each individual when deciding an effective course of treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain patients with BCS also present with typical MS lesions. Initial treatment with high doses of corticosteroids is recommended for this group, but poor responders to steroids could be treated with rituximab. In contrast, in patients with BCS who do not present typical MS lesions, the initial corticosteroid treatment needs to be followed by immediate immunosuppression. This is because activated macrophages play an important role in the development of demyelinating BCS lesions. Cyclophosphamide is considered the only agent that can effectively suppress this type of inflammation and control the disease. Plasma exchange was not found to be effective in these patients. Interferon beta-1a, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and fingolimod may be more beneficial in the former group of patients than in individuals who present with BCS lesions alone.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Marburg&rsquo;s disease</strong></h2>
<p>This is an aggressive form of MS that progresses rapidly, leading to death. Although acute disease is typically treated using high doses of methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and immunoglobulin,<sup>5</sup> corticosteroids and plasma exchange are usually not effective. Strongly immunosuppressive therapy may be required. The immunosuppressants mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and alemtuzumab have been successful in previously reported cases. Regardless, the outcome of cyclophosphamide treatment is inconsistent across different cases, possibly because of variations in the treatment protocol.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>A recent case report described a patient with Marburg&rsquo;s disease who did not respond to the abovementioned therapies.<sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, the condition of this patient was stabilized with natalizumab, which has previously exhibited high efficacy and short-term safety even in aggressive forms of MS. Additionally, the patient showed both clinical and imagiological improvement that was sustained for 12 months. This is a noteworthy development considering that Marburg&rsquo;s disease is typically associated with rapid progression and a fatal outcome. However, natalizumab treatment is associated with a risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which increases with treatment duration and immunosuppression. Therefore, despite its high efficacy, long-term treatment with natalizumab may not be a viable option.</p>
<h2><strong>Schilder&rsquo;s disease</strong></h2>
<p>Schilder&rsquo;s disease is a progressive condition presenting with one or two extensive demyelinating lesions in the centrum ovale. Treatment with high doses of steroids has been reported to be effective. Immunomodulatory therapeutics used in typical MS may be used, particularly in patients exhibiting oligoclonal bands (a hallmark of MS) and in cases where the distinction between Schilder&rsquo;s disease and typical MS is unclear. However, further evidence is required for establishing concrete guidelines on the treatment of this disease.<sup> 6</sup></p>
<h2><strong>Pediatric-onset MS</strong></h2>
<p>MS is rare in the pediatric population. However, due to the development of disability over the course of the disease, early diagnosis and treatment initiation is critical. Advancements in research have enabled earlier diagnosis and administration of highly efficacious DMTs at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, the number of DMTs available for these patients has increased. Common first-line treatments include fingolimod, which is the only FDA-approved drug for pediatric-onset MS; interferons; and glatiramer acetate. Other effective treatments are dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide.<sup> 7</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinicians are aiming to achieve a state of no clinical relapse, no disease progression, no new MRI activity, no cognitive decline, and no evidence of brain atrophy (NEDA-4). This goal can be realized through the development of therapies with higher efficacy.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Future directions</strong></h2>
<p>Currently, the treatment of rare variants of MS tend to be based on strategies used in typical MS and evidence from case reports. For the successful management of these rare forms of MS, it is important to develop therapeutics and conduct large clinical trials for specific MS variants. This will help identify biomarkers for early differential diagnosis and treatment prognosis, as well establish standard treatment guidelines for these conditions.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Analysts had expected sales to come in below $7 billion, and the firm&rsquo;s share price rose 2% on Thursday, before continuing to rise a further 4% to &pound;77.04 on Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earnings per share (EPS) doubled in the quarter, at $1.19, reflecting the benefit from a lower tax rate as a result of a non-taxable gain from the sale of Viela Bio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The firm retained a 26.7% stake in the spinout, which was bought in February by Horizon Therapeutics (Nasdaq: HZNP), for $3.05 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overall, the result were driven by a strong performance across the board, with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s oncology and CVRM - cardiovascular, renal and metabolic - divisions growing 16% and 15%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over half of revenues were contributed by new medicines, and all regions delivered what chief executive Pascal Soriot called &ldquo;encouraging growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">AstraZeneca, which has been buffeted by </span><a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eu-sues-vaccine-developer-while-usa-donates-excess-supplies""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">legal and regulatory challenges</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> surrounding its coronavirus vaccine, is benefiting from a bold, decade-old strategy to invest heavily in R&amp;D.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mr Soriot said the quarter was marked by &ldquo;strong revenue and earnings progression, continued profitability, and cash-flow generation, despite the pandemic's ongoing negative impact on the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He added: &ldquo;We expect the impact of COVID to reduce and anticipate a performance acceleration in the second half of 2021.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Coronavirus impact</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike other vaccine producers, AstraZeneca has agreed with Oxford University, the developer of its option Vaxzevria, to sell the product on a non-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For this reason, despite having already delivered over 65 million doses, at a cost of $275 million, the impact of the program has been to lower EPS by three cents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The figures show Vaxzevria costs about $4 per shot, significantly cheaper than most alternatives, raising hopes that the product could help put a stop to the spread of coronavirus in developing countries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The firm, which plans to ramp up vaccine supplies, said production yields were continuing to improve.</span></p>
<h2><strong>First quarter developments</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the data and regulatory front, the firm highlighted results from the OlympiA Phase III trial, which demonstrated Lynparza's (olaparib) benefit for certain forms of early breast cancer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mr Soriot also pointed to the proposed $30 billion acquisition of Alexion as key to sustaining pipeline progress and accelerating business performance. The firm plans to integrate the Boston-based firm as its rare disease unit and area of expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In mid-April the proposal cleared US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) review, an important milestone, and the deal is expected to close in the third quarter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The company reiterated its forecast for the full year, on a constant exchange rate (CER) basis, guiding for a revenue increase by a low-teens percentage, accompanied by faster growth in core EPS to between $4.75 and $5.</span></p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s shares were up 3.4% at $4.00 pre-market.</p>
<p>In February, the European Commission (EC) approved Ogluo. As the EC decision was received after the end of the Brexit transition period, Xeris was required to complete a further administrative step in order to obtain a license in Great Britain. No re-examination of clinical data by MHRA was required. The marketing authorization is valid in the UK and all 27 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein.</p>
<h2><strong>Seeking commercialization partners</strong></h2>
<p>As previously stated, the Company is actively seeking a partner to commercialize Ogluo in the UK, European Union, and other regions, with a targeted fourth quarter 2021 launch in select EU countries.</p>
<p>Under the trade names Gvoke PFS and Gvoke HypoPen, Xeris&rsquo; glucagon injections, were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2019.</p>

<p>The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating non-inferiority versus sevelamer carbonate in the change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at week 12.</p>
<p>Dr Klaus Henning Jensen, chief medical officer of Vifor Pharma Group, commented: &ldquo;We are delighted by the positive results from the PA-CL-CHINA-01 study, which confirm previous data generated in the US and Europe, and reinforce the potential of Velphoro as an important new treatment option for dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia in China where there is a high prevalence of CKD<sup>1</sup>. This is another important step in our geographic expansion and will further strengthen the position of Velphoro as a global leader in the calcium-free phosphate binder market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Importantly, patients who received Velphoro experienced additional benefits compared to those in the sevelamer control group:&nbsp;Serum phosphorus levels in patients treated with Velphoro declined faster than in the sevelamer group and the average number of tablets taken daily (3.23) was significantly lower than with sevelamer carbonate (6.31). Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of Velphoro with new safety signal observed in Chinese CKD patients with no hyperphosphataemia.</p>
<h2><strong>China regulatory filing plan</strong></h2>
<p>VFMCRP intends to submit the Chinese New Drug Application to China&rsquo;s National Medical Products Administration&rsquo;s CDE at the end of 2021. Velphoro gained European approval in 2014 and the USA in 2013.</p>
<p>This phase-III study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the change from baseline at week 12 in serum phosphorus between PA21 (Velphoro) and sevelamer carbonate, and support market expansion of Velphoro to China.</p>

<p>As part of their review of the company&rsquo;s Biologics License Application (BLA) for tralokinumab, an investigational therapy for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, has issued a CRL requesting additional data relating to a device component of tralokinumab. The FDA did not request any new data on the clinical efficacy or safety of the drug product formulation of tralokinumab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to bringing tralokinumab to the market to support the millions of US adults who live with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The FDA has not raised any questions to the clinical efficacy or safety of tralokinumab, but only requested additional data relating to a device component of the combination product. We will now work closely with the FDA to address their request and bring tralokinumab to the U.S. patients as quickly as possible,&rdquo; said J&ouml;rg M&ouml;ller, executive vice president, global R&amp;D at LEO Pharma.</p>
<p>The BLA submission was based on efficacy and safety results from the ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3 pivotal Phase III trials, which included more than 1,900 adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Safety data was evaluated from a pool of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, including ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3, a dose-finding trial, and a vaccine response trial.</p>
<p>Many, though not all, of the CRLs issued recently by the FDA have been a result of the agency being unable to carry out manufacturing inspections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as for example one issued yesterday to Protalix BioTherapeutics. Several CRLs were also issued for supplemental BLAs, seeking full approval for drugs that had been cleared under the agency&rsquo;s accelerated process, indicating a tougher stance from the FDA.</p>
<h2><strong>Commercial prospects</strong></h2>
<p>If approved, tralokinumab is expected to be the first biologic treatment in the atopic dermatitis space to challenge Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) and Regeneron&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: REGN) Dupixent (dupilumab), and analysts at GlobalData have forecast peak sales of $1.6 billion for the LEO drug, while they see Dupixent revenues exceeding $5 billion.</p>

<p>The Israeli pharma company stressed that the CRL did not report any concerns relating to the potential safety or efficacy of PRX&ndash;102 in the submitted data package.</p>
<p>In the CRL, the FDA noted that an inspection of Protalix' manufacturing facility in Carmiel, Israel, including its subsequent assessment of any related findings, is required before the agency can approve the BLA.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Protalix remains confident that it will be able to work with the FDA to resolve these issues and provide a new, alternative drug to Fabry patients""</span>Due to travel restrictions, the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection during the review cycle.</p>
<p>A statement from Protalix said that the FDA will continue to monitor the public health situation as well as travel restrictions, and is actively working to define an approach for scheduling outstanding inspections.</p>
<p>The statement adds: &ldquo;With respect to the third-party facility in Europe at which fill and finish processes are performed for PRX-102, due to COVID&ndash;19, the FDA reviewed records under Section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in lieu of a pre-licensing inspection. In the CRL, the FDA stated that it will communicate remaining issues to the facility in order to seek prompt resolution of any pending items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sanofi&rsquo;s (Euronext: SAN) Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) has recently been converted to full approval by the FDA, something that the agency has noted that Protalix will have to address in any potential resubmission seeking accelerated approval of PRX 102.</p>
<p>Protalix has compared its drug with the Sanofi competitor in an attempt to show that PRX-102 can provide a new option in Fabry disease.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s statement adds: &ldquo;Protalix intends to work collaboratively with the agency to identify the most expeditious pathway to approval, including accelerated approval.

<p>The total cumulative spending on COVID-19 vaccines through 2025 is projected to be $157 billion, largely focused on the initial wave of vaccinations to be completed by 2022. In subsequent years, booster shots are expected to be required on a biannual basis as the durability of immunity and the continued emergence of viral variants make an endemic virus the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the pandemic has been extremely disruptive, the pre-pandemic forces of medicine use and spending remain significant drivers of the outlook, and these forces have only been modestly impacted by the immediate effects of COVID-19,&rdquo; said Murray Aitken, IQVIA senior vice president and executive director of the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. &ldquo;The success of countries around the world in implementing a global vaccination program - unprecedented in speed and scope - will be key to the outlook for all medicine use through 2025 and beyond,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2>

<li>The global medicine market - using invoice price levels - is expected to grow at 3%-6% CAGR through 2025;</li>
<li>The total cumulative spending on COVID-19 vaccines through 2025 is projected to be $157 billion;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Global medicine spending will be lifted by stronger pharmerging market growth through 2025 and offset by slower growth in developed markets caused by losses of exclusivity for original brands;</li>
<li>Savings from biosimilars will reach an estimated $285 billion over the next five years;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The two leading global therapy areas - oncology and immunology - are forecast to grow 9%-12% CAGR through 2025, lifted by significant increases in new treatments and medicine use;</li>
<li>On a net price basis, the US market is forecast to grow 0%-3% CAGR over the next five years, down from 3% CAGR for the past five years;</li>
<li>As the third largest global market, Japan will have flat-to-declining medicine spending as a result of the continued biennial price cut policy but see rising patent-protected original brand spending coinciding with policies to encourage a shift to generics for older medicines; and</li>
<li>Spending in Europe is expected to increase 2%-5% CAGR or a total of $35 billion over the five years to 2025.</li>

<p>Moderna now expects to supply up to three billion doses of the product next year, through its owned and partnered production sites, with the costs being met by the firm&rsquo;s available funds.</p>
<p>The firm plans to double drug substance manufacturing at Lonza&rsquo;s (SIX: LONN) Switzerland-based facility.</p>
<p>Formulation, fill and finish and drug substance manufacturing at Rovi&rsquo;s (BME: ROVI) Spain-based site will also more than double, while drug substance production will increase by 50% at Moderna&rsquo;s USA-based plant.</p>
<h2>Vaccinating the world</h2>
<p>While more than a billion doses of coronavirus vaccine have been administered globally, there remains significant demand for supplies, with many countries struggling under the impact of growing infection rates.</p>
<p>Some countries are also planning a booster campaign to protect against a resurgence in winter, with the UK ordering an additional 60 million doses of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BNTX) jab.</p>
<p>Moderna&rsquo;s option has been approved in multiple jurisdictions, including in the UK, Canada and Europe, as well as the USA.</p>
<p>The company has also raised its 2021 manufacturing supply forecast to between 800 million and one billion doses.</p>
<p>Chief executive St&eacute;phane Bancel said: &ldquo;We are hearing from governments that there is no technology that provides the high efficacy of mRNA vaccines and the speed necessary to adapt to variants, while allowing reliable scalability of manufacturing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Further development</h2>
<p>In a statement, the firm said that mRNA vaccines can &ldquo;respond rapidly to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including variants of concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moderna is already testing SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccine and multivalent vaccine boosters in humans, with pre-clinical data showing a boost to neutralizing titers. Trials are also underway in children.</p>
<p>The firm said it would be in a position to better estimate supply ranges for 2022 as its clinical program progresses, providing more information on required dosing levels.</p>
<p>Moderna also announced that new data indicated the potential for a three-month refrigerated shelf life for the vaccine in alternative formats, which would facilitate easier distribution to doctor&rsquo;s offices and other smaller settings if authorized.</p>
<p>The firm is also working on a next generation vaccine (mRNA-1283) that it believes will extend refrigerated shelf life even further.</p>","2021-04-29 12:39:00",,"vaccine, Moderna, manufacturing, doses, coronavirus, billion, mRNA, USA-based, supplies, boost, firm, drug, substance, aims, production, global, investing","Cambridge, USA-based mRNA specialist Moderna is investing in manufacturing facilities to boost global supplies of its coronavirus vaccine in 2022.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-29 12:31:28","2021-04-29 12:42:14",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/moderna-aims-to-make-three-billion-doses-of-coronavirus-vaccine,,,,,,moderna_therapeutics_large.jpg,moderna_therapeutics_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Production, Research",USA,"Moderna Therapeutics",mRNA-1273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Amplyx&rsquo; lead compound, fosmanogepix (APX001), is a novel investigational asset under development for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. Financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
<p>In addition to fosmanogepix, Pfizer acquires Amplyx' early-stage pipeline, including potential antiviral (MAU868) and antifungal (APX2039) therapies. MAU868, licensed from Novartis (NOVN: VX), is a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody with activity against the BK virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The acquisition of Amplyx follows an initial equity investment by Pfizer in December 2019 as part of Amplyx&rsquo; Series C financing. At that time, Pfizer joined a world class group of biotechnology investors that included 3&times;5 Partners, Adage Capital Management, Arix Bioscience, BioMed Ventures, Lundbeckfonden Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Pappas Capital, RiverVest Venture Partners and Sofinnova Investments.</p>
<h2><strong>Adds to buy of Arixa</strong></h2>
<p>Last October, Pfizer acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals, a company making a next-generation oral antibiotic, ARX-1796, that, if approved, would be one of the first new drugs of its kind in 35 years.</p>
<p>More than 1.5 million cases of invasive fungal infections occur worldwide each year, with mortality rates as high as 30%-80% across infection types. Fosmanogepix has a novel mechanism of action with the potential to target fungal strains resistant to standard of care therapy. As there are only three classes of antifungal medications currently available, antifungal resistance can severely limit treatment options; a potential new therapeutic class may therefore be of importance for both physicians and patients. There has been no novel therapeutic class of antifungal therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder of the devastating impact of infectious diseases, highlighting the continuous need for new anti-infective therapies to treat both emerging and difficult to treat bacterial, viral and fungal infections,&rdquo; said Angela Lukin, global president, Pfizer Hospital.</p>","2021-04-29 11:48:00","Pfizer expands anti-infectives pipeline with acquisition","Pfizer, Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Acquisition, M&A, Fosmanogepix, Anti-fungal","Pfizer expands anti-infectives pipeline with acquisition",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-29 11:47:20","2021-04-29 11:55:41",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pfizer-expands-anti-infectives-pipeline-with-acquisition,,,,,,pfizer_colour_new_large.png,pfizer_colour_new_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Antibiotics, Infectious diseases","Companies, mergers and acquisitions",USA,"Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer",fosmanogepix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

There is currently no approved drug treatment for CMT1A.","<p>French neurodegenerative diseases specialist Pharnext (EPA: ALPHA) has announced new results from an interim analysis of an ongoing open-label follow-up extension study (PLEO-CMT-FU trial) following the first double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (PLEO-CMT trial) of PXT3003 for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (CMT1A). There is currently no approved drug treatment for CMT1A.</p>
<p>In January 2020, the company reported interim results suggesting sustained safety and efficacy of PXT3003 in patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A after 24 months of total trial time (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU Period 1 trials). The new results announced today continue to show sustained treatment benefits for CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 at High Dose (HD) in the PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2 trial with a data readout at 54 months of total trial time (double-blind + open-label).</p>
<p>Market reaction was negative, as Pharnext&rsquo;s shares closed down 3.3% at 3.24 euros following the announcement.</p>
<h2><strong>Highlights from an analysis of available data include:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>PXT3003 was safe and well tolerated. Data are consistent with observed safety profile in prior clinical trials.</li>
<li>Data on the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS), which measures patients&rsquo; functional motor disability, are as follows (please refer to the diagram below for graphical illustration):</li>
<ul>
<li>During PLEO-CMT (double-blind Phase III study), patients treated with placebo on average declined on ONLS while patients treated with PXT3003 on average improved. The best efficacy signal was observed in the cohort of patients treated with PXT3003 HD.</li>
<li>During PLEO-CMT-FU (open-label Phase III Extension study), on average patients improved on ONLS across all patient cohorts.</li>
<ul>
<li>Patients treated with placebo declined on ONLS during the double-blind phase, but then improved when switched to PXT3003 in the ongoing open-label phase.</li>
<li>Patients treated with PXT3003 during the double-blind phase continue to improve when pursuing their treatment with PXT3003 in the ongoing open-label phase.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>New results with available ONLS data after 54 months of total trial time suggest a better efficacy signal with PXT3003 HD in this patient population.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although these new data were generated from an open-label study, the findings are consistent with the safety and efficacy results&nbsp;of PXT3003 observed in&nbsp;prior clinical studies in CMT1A. In addition, the fact we have just initiated the PREMIER trial&nbsp;in&nbsp;a similar patient population, using&nbsp;the same High&nbsp;Dose of PXT3003 and measuring the same efficacy endpoint ONLS, reinforces our confidence&nbsp;in the potential positive outcome of our ongoing pivotal Phase III study,&rdquo; commented Pharnext&rsquo;s chief medical officer Adrian Hepner.</p>","2021-04-29 11:10:00","Pharnext updates on PXT3003 for patients with CMT1APharnext updates on","Pharnext, PXT3003, CMT1A, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Phase III","Pharnext updates on PXT3003 for patients with CMT1A",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-29 11:09:48","2021-04-29 23:25:13",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pharnext-updates-on-pxt3003-for-patients-with-cmt1a,,,,,,pharnext-large.jpg,pharnext-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Neurological, Rare diseases","Drug Trial, Research",France,Pharnext,PXT3003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Revenues were $3.98 billion, a decrease of 9% or 10% in local currency terms, compared to the first quarter of 2020.

Global Copaxone sales for the quarter fell 15% to $276 million.</p>
<p>On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, operating income for the quarter was $434 million, compared to $191 million in the first quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.08 billion, a decrease of 13%. The decrease was mainly due to lower profit in our Europe segment.</p>
<p>Overall, Teva earned 63 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the January-March period, down from 76 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue fell 9% to $3.98 billion.

<p>Going to the global market for Chinese pharmas is a complicated process that requires a well devised strategy that often entails differentiation and partnerships, said speakers at the DJSeedin innovation partnering conference held last week in Shanghai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is talking about globalization, but it is not as easy as it sounds,&rdquo; said Lianshan Zhang, head of global R&amp;D at Hengrui Medicine.</p>
<p>Dr Zhang has every account to make this statement, given that Hengrui has recently been actively expanding businesses outside China. It has over 10 novel drugs in clinical studies at various stages in the USA, European Union and Australia, including a combo of camrelizumab (PD1 antibody) and apatinib for hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA in Phase III studies.</p>
<p>Differentiation, he said, plays an important role to have a successful trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gave pyrotinib as an example. Developed by Hengrui, the asset is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2. In China, it was approved in 2018 to treat HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. In the USA, however, it is under Phase III studies as a therapy for advanced non-squamous NSCLC with HER2 mutations.</p>
<p>Swiss pharma giant Roche (ROG: SIX subsidiary &ldquo;Genentech is really strong in breast cancer treatments, so it&rsquo;s wise for us to choose another indication that has unmet medical needs in the US. This is called differentiation,&rdquo; Dr Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Lu Xianping from Chipscreen Biosciences, a Shenzhen-based biotech, going global does not necessarily mean a US launch. He chose Japan as the first overseas market for the company&rsquo;s proprietary T cell lymphoma treatment Epidaza (chidamide). In Japan, the asset is under review for the same indication, and Dr Lu expects an approval this year. The Japan choice is mainly about the cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FDA required evaluations on cardiovascular risks among over 10,000 study participants. It was too costly for us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dr Lu agreed with Hengrui&rsquo;s Dr Zhang that Food and Drug Administration authorities usually welcome novel assets that would address urgent clinical needs. This can be said to Chipscreen&rsquo;s serine-threonine kinase inhibitor chiauranib, which recently gained the FDA&rsquo;s approval to do studies in the USA. The asset employs a new mechanism to slow down the progression of SCLC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FDA authorities are interested because few novel drugs are available to slow down the fast developing cancer,&rdquo; he added. In China, the asset is exploring combo therapies targeting a blaster of cancers, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer and neuroendocrine tumor.</p>
<p>For the China market, local companies will continue to pump out innovative drugs through licensing deals. Chipscreen is looking for early-stage assets that ideally could pair with its own treatments to make combo therapies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to treat tumors with just one drug. We are actively looking for good combo solutions,&rdquo; Dr Lu said.</p>
<p>For Hengrui, Dr Zhang said he is interested in assets targeting blood cancers as well as infectious diseases to complement Hengrui&rsquo;s pipeline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assets with great data from Phase II studies are usually in our interest. We prefer in-licensing an asset that can get into the Phase III studies in China right away,&rdquo; Dr Zhang said.</p>
<h2><strong>MNCs also looking to partnerships</strong></h2>
<p>Both Chinese pharmas and MNCs are looking into partnerships to speed up the R&amp;D process. Roche, for example, is looking for early-stage assets and start-ups specialized in diagnostics, said Harm-Jan Borgeld, global head of Asia partnering at Roche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not only looking for global innovations, but also local innovations in China,&rdquo; he said. Dr Borgeld added that, while his team would love see an asset offering impressive data from Phase II studies, but it is difficult to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are ok with early stage assets. They can be small molecules, large molecules, immunology and neurology. If you have an asset targeting Alzheimer&rsquo;s, talk to me immediately because we know how huge the unmet medical need is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>May Wang, senior vice president for business development at the Shanghai-based biotech Hutchmed, echoed Chipscreen&rsquo;s Dr Lu&rsquo;s thoughts on combo therapies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Combo therapies is the future. We want to partner with companies with whom we can do development together,&rdquo; she said.</p>","2021-04-28 17:07:00","Differentiation and partnership key to Chinese companies’ global strat","DJSeedin conference, Partnerships,  Differentiatiom.

488487,,"How is healthcare access in Southeast Asia shaping up in 2021?","A Special Report on the top five trends redefining the way healthcare stakeholders look at long-term healthcare access sustainability in the region from Roshel Jayasundera, director, Global Consulting, Axios International.","<p><em>A Special Report on the top five trends redefining the way healthcare stakeholders look at long-term healthcare access sustainability in the region from Roshel Jayasundera, director, Global Consulting, Axios International.</em></p>
<p>Over the last decade, Southeast Asia&rsquo;s healthcare landscape has evolved considerably. This has been chiefly led by the seismic shifts in disease patterns and population trends, the increase in universal healthcare coverage plans as well as the rise of scientific breakthroughs in healthcare.</p>
<p>However, the landscape has also been defined by the ongoing attempts by stakeholders to overcome persistent gaps within the healthcare access ecosystem &ndash; the growth of which has not kept pace with the region&rsquo;s broader socio-economic development. These realities were put under the microscope during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especially in terms of access.</p>
<p>The region&rsquo;s stakeholders must work together to ensure there are efforts that complement health systems to properly care for and manage the needs of today&rsquo;s population. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s important to consider the following five key trends influencing the current state of healthcare access in Southeast Asia, and what can be done to improve its long-term sustainability.</p>
<h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Access is being re-defined &ndash; from a short-term strategy to a long-term solution</strong></h2>
<p>Traditionally, treatment access solutions for patients paying out-of-pocket for treatment were considered a short-term strategy until a treatment was reimbursed in the country. For years, pharmaceutical companies focused mainly on reimbursement, hoping to obtain reimbursement for specialty, high-cost treatments in the same way as primary care medications.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has only exacerbated these reimbursement challenges. It has also increased the number of people who have lost their jobs and are no longer covered or able to afford private insurance. This makes sustainable access solutions more important than ever, especially given that many people in Southeast Asia are particularly vulnerable when it comes to healthcare financing, with over 65 million people being pushed into poverty because of health expenditure.</p>
<p>As government priorities shifted and budget cuts remained, companies were already looking to alternative access solutions such as patient assistance programs (PAPs) or patient support programs (PSPs) as long-term solutions. This prompted a series of shifts in how access is defined and prioritized, and countries across Southeast Asia &ndash; especially its middle-income and emerging markets &ndash; have been pushing through slews of health-financing reforms to help manage costs of more widespread healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>Our organization is doing its part to improve access through cost-sharing initiatives that help split costs across multiple parties over a period of time. This includes working with pharmaceutical companies to assess how much help patients need to afford their full treatment course &ndash; using a unique confidential assessment tool called the Patient Financial Ability Tool (PFET) &ndash; which is being used in all the Asian countries we are present in.</p>
<p>Such alternative access programs can help supplement long-term efforts by government and healthcare stakeholders. However, accessibility is not purely defined by affordability.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Access no longer stops at affordability</strong></h2>
<p>Access is a multi-dimensional issue, so it must be addressed with multi-dimensional solutions. To maximize treatment outcomes, access solutions have evolved from focusing solely on treatment affordability to offering services to support patients throughout their treatment journey &ndash; from diagnosis to treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Currently, treatment adherence remains a problem across Southeast Asia. This is reflected in the persistent adherence problems for certain chronic diseases in Singapore, while studies have placed non-adherence rates in Malaysia at up to 56%, with little improvement over the years. Health outcomes are multifactorial &ndash; other than genetics and medical care, social circumstances can affect 15-40%, environmental and physical influences 5%-20%, and behavior 30%-50%.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there are growing rates of chronic diseases requiring life-long treatment, and so adherence solutions are needed now more than ever. But each patient journey is unique and necessitates the availability of customized support programs that can comprehensively meet the patient&rsquo;s underserved needs and challenges in more personalized ways &ndash; not via &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approaches.</p>
<h2><strong>3. There is a growing focus on reaching patients outside the hospital</strong></h2>
<p>Hospitals and health facilities have long been the central pillar of health systems. But the world has radically changed while the healthcare sector has remained mostly stagnant &ndash; creating a significant void outside health facilities. This is because most healthcare systems do not have the infrastructure, network and/or capacity to communicate with patients when they leave the hospital.</p>
<p>The result is poor treatment adherence and less than optimal medical outcomes. However, the private sector, including pharmaceutical companies, is well-positioned to expedite this much-needed change, as they can collaborate with the wider healthcare ecosystem to offer products or services outside of hospitals or clinics that are facing increasing capacity burdens.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, populations are growing and healthcare demands are rising, especially with the pandemic still ongoing, while the healthcare system is overburdened. For instance, the heavily subsidised public sector in Malaysia caters to about 65% of the population but is served by just 45% of all registered doctors, with even fewer specialists (25%-30%). To overcome the patient support gap outside of healthcare facilities, more public and private healthcare access stakeholders are exploring the use of digital tools, especially those that can complement existing services and reducing the reliance on in-hospital services.</p>
<p>Overall, digital tools can save considerable time and costs, enabling health facilities to improve their capacity and better support patients. By making them more efficient, cost-savings can eventually improve patient access at scale, leading to the more holistic maximization of health outcomes.</p>
<p>That said, while digitalization can streamline operations and optimize resources, they remain as enablers; they wouldn&rsquo;t work as efficiently &ndash; or as effectively &ndash; if they were a standalone solution. Without the human element, any self-reported information added to the digital platform by the patient would begin and end with them. By proactively triggering a response based on data entered, the human factor behind a digital platform plays a significant role in maximising health benefits for patients.</p>
<p>Our efforts &ndash; be they digital or physical &ndash; should reach patients irrespective of where they are. Hence, equal emphasis should be placed on physical channels that support providing the continuum of care with patients outside of healthcare institutions, and help relieve the capacity burdens faced by hospitals, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<h2>4. Companies are exploring new ways to engage with governments on access</h2>
<p>While the role of the private sector in helping to improve access is more vital than ever, long-term sustainability cannot be achieved without government involvement. While government engagement is key for a sustainable access strategy, companies still find it challenging to engage with public sector agencies on treatment access beyond traditional reimbursement discussions.</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, companies and other access stakeholders must evolve their ways to not only engage, but also work closely with governments on the value of collaborative solutions. This should focus on looking beyond conventional approaches to minimizing access burden and move the needle forward on access.</p>
<p>For instance, in Malaysia, there are cost-sharing programs that allow for co-funding between the government and pharmaceutical companies. The government&rsquo;s willingness to innovate and explore different ways of improving access paves the way for successful solutions.</p>
<p>We have seen first-hand the potential of similar partnerships within the ecosystem in different parts of the world. It also rings true for stakeholders in the private sector, such as insurance companies, whose role has evolved and can make a difference in access initiatives. The more stakeholders involved in enabling healthcare access, the better.</p>
<h2>5. More relevant data is needed to inform access decision-making</h2>
<p>Even before the pandemic, the world was in the thick of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Technology is now facilitating the evolution of societies, industries and governments, and so the healthcare sector must keep up with the rapidly changing environment. One way the healthcare ecosystem can do this is by leveraging more data to improve decision-making processes.</p>
<p>This is because, as broader access becomes more integral across multiple therapeutic areas, the need for robust data to inform access decisions has increased. The data needed to inform access decisions can be different from data typically collected via clinical trials or post-marketing studies, and hence they can provide breakthrough insights on areas like disease evolution, treatment, patients&rsquo; perceptions, outcomes and cost. For this reason, there&rsquo;s a need to capture access-related real-world insights to gauge the impact of access interventions and their overall effectiveness. At Axios International, we&rsquo;ve been using this data to understand how to ensure optimum treatment access, affordability, and adherence amongst patients and improve how PSPs should be designed to reach patient benefits.</p>
<h2>Access is no longer 'a good to have'</h2>
<p>Today, access to healthcare solutions is being increasingly integrated with the business models of private sector stakeholders, namely pharmaceutical companies. The key difference now as compared to previous efforts is that there is now a more concerted effort to develop sustainable access models, rather than one-off short-term solutions. Nevertheless, true sustainability can only happen via a multi-sectoral, multi-dimensional response.</p>
<p>In fast-developing regions such as Southeast Asia, current healthcare systems are no longer able to quickly adapt to the ever-evolving needs of patients living in our rapidly changing world. Unless the widening access gaps are addressed, healthcare for patients will gradually become less effective, in addition to there being more sub-optimal outcomes and &ndash; above all &ndash; the inability to respond to future public health challenges.</p>
<p>Hence, the onus is now on Southeast Asia&rsquo;s companies, access specialists and civil society groups to instil this change. Each has a key part to play in collaborating with the government to close access gaps, but they must work in concert with each other if they want to ensure that patients will have access to quality care and treatment, wherever they are.</p>","2021-04-28 16:57:00",,"access, healthcare, treatment, patients, stakeholders, solutions, Southeast, companies, long-term, health, Asia, patient, sector, improve, sustainability","A Special Report on the top five trends redefining the way healthcare stakeholders look at long-term healthcare access sustainability in the region from Roshel ",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-28 16:05:07","2021-04-30 14:38:12",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-is-healthcare-access-in-southeast-asia-shaping-up-in-2021,,,,,,southeast-asia_big.jpg,southeast_asia_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Asia Pacific, Focus On, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Special report","Southeast Asia","Axios International",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488480,,"FDA grants priority review for Nefecon, for patients with IgAN","Swedish biotech Calliditas Therapeutics says that the US Food and Drug Administration has accepted its New Drug Application for Nefecon (budesonide) for priority review as a treatment for IgA nephropathy (IgAN).","<p>Swedish biotech Calliditas Therapeutics (STO: CALTX) says that the US Food and Drug Administration has accepted its New Drug Application for Nefecon (budesonide) for priority review as a treatment for IgA nephropathy (IgAN).</p>
<p>The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target actions date for Nefecon of September 15, 2021. Calliditas&rsquo; shares roared up 9.7% to 133.40 Swedish kronor in early afternoon trading following the announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about being granted priority review, which reflects the unmet medical need of IgAN. We look forward to engaging with the agency and work towards an accelerated approval later this year so that we will be in a position to provide the first approved medication for IgAN patients,&rdquo; said chief executive Ren&eacute;e Aguiar-Lucander.</p>
<p>Calliditas says it is the only company which has achieved positive data in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb and Phase III clinical trials in IgAN. If approved, Nefecon would become the first therapy specifically designed and approved for the treatment of IgAN, with the potential to be disease modifying. Subject to approval by the FDA, Calliditas intends to commercialize Nefecon for IgAN on its own in the USA.</p>
<p>Around half of people with IgAN - up to 200,000 in the USA and Europe - are at risk of disease progression, which can lead to the highly burdensome treatments of dialysis and transplantation.</p>
<h2><strong>Blockbuster sales forecast</strong></h2>
<p>In this context, analysts have forecast that Nefecon, a patient-friendly oral treatment, could have global blockbuster potential, with peak sales in excess of $1 billion.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Calliditas filed an NDA with the FDA on March 15, 2021. The NDA submission is based on positive data from Part A of the NefIgArd pivotal Phase 3 study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nefecon compared to placebo in 200 adult patients with IgAN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a target action date provides us with a clear timeline as we continue to expand our US organization and prepare for commercialization in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to approval,&rdquo; said head of North America Commercial Andrew Udell.</p>

488476,,"Pandemic and pricing dent first quarter performance at Amgen","A hugely disappointing first quarter for Amgen saw revenues slide to $5.9 billion, down from $6.2 billion and below most analysts’ expectations.","<p>A hugely disappointing first quarter for Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) saw revenues slide to $5.9 billion, down from $6.2 billion and below most analysts&rsquo; expectations.</p>
<p>Shares in the company fell 2% on Tuesday, and continued falling a further 3% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Chief executive Robert Bradway explained that the firm&rsquo;s performance was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with more people staying at home instead of visiting their doctor. March is also traditionally a slow month, the firm said.</p>
<p>However, with sales volumes on the up, the outcome is largely due to a fall in prices, which saw a net decline of 7%. Revenues for autoimmune blockbuster Enbrel (etanercept) were off 20%, while migraine drug Aimovig (erenumab) saw 7% lower revenues.</p>
<p>Following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), net income was $1.6 billion, down 10%, with earnings per share (EPS) decreasing 8% to $2.83.</p>
<p>Staying positive, Mr Bradway said: ""While our business continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the first two months of the quarter, we are encouraged by strong volume trends in many of our newer products and remain confident in the outlook for the full year.""</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;We also continue to advance key pipeline opportunities, including three late-stage assets that have earned Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration.""</p>
<p>While high rates of vaccination in the USA will help patient visits and diagnoses to recover, the firm said it expected to see &ldquo;continuing disruption from COVID-19 in the second quarter and, to a lesser degree, in the second half of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first quarter, demand was most negatively affected in January and February due to a surge of cases in the USA and in Europe, with the situation improving in March and continuing into April.</p>
<p>Amgen reaffirmed its 2021 total revenue guidance, at $25.8 to $26.6 billion, with EPS guidance revised to between $9.11 and $10.71 on a GAAP basis.</p>

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made several regulatory requests related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls in a December 2019 CRL that followed the first RVT-802 BLA submission in April 2019.</p>
<p>Enzyvant has been working since that time to address each of the FDA requests. The expected action date provided by the agency under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act is October 8, 2021.</p>
<p>An ultra-rare condition in which children are born without a thymus, congenital athymia can lead to profound immunodeficiency, immune dysregulation and high susceptibility to infections.</p>
<p>With only supportive care, patients with congenital athymia typically die from infections or autoimmune manifestations by age two or three. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments available for congenital athymia.</p>
<p>RVT802 has been granted multiple regulatory designations, including the FDA classification as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy.</p>

<p>In the first quarter, Sanofi sales were 8.59 billion euros ($10.38 billion), down 4.3% on a reported basis. Exchange rate movements had a negative effect of 6.7 percentage&nbsp;points, mainly driven by the decrease of the US dollar, Brazilian real, Russian rouble, Turkish lira, and Argentine peso and Japanese yen. At constant exchange rates (CER), Sanofi sales increased 2.4%.</p>
<p>First-quarter business operating income (BOI) increased 4.0% to 2.64 billion. At CER, BOI increased 13.3%. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 2.4 percentage points to 30.7% versus the prior year. Net income was up 14.7% at 2.017 billion euros at CER. Business earnings per share (EPS) were 1.61 euros, up 15% at CER.</p>
<p>First-quarter 2021 Pharmaceutical sales increased 3.8% to 6.56 million, with double-digit growth of the Specialty Care portfolio mainly driven by the strong performance of Dupixent (dupilumab), which largely offset lower sales in General Medicines in Europe and the USA.</p>
<p><strong>Full-year 2021 business EPS guidance affirmed</strong></p>
<p>Sanofi expects 2021 business EPS to grow high single digit at CER, barring unforeseen major adverse events. Applying average April 2021 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2021 business EPS is estimated to be between -4% to -5%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our strong first-quarter performance is the result of the continued execution of our Play to Win strategy to drive growth and bring innovative medicines to patients. Dupixent continues its outstanding performance with impressive growth in the US and strong uptake in global markets, including China. Vaccines delivered growth in its core segments, said chief executive Paul Hudson, adding: &ldquo;We initiated and completed enrollment of our Phase II study for our recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate in the first quarter and results are expected next month. Following the communication of our ESG strategy at the end of 2020 and embedding it into our business priorities, we have recently created the Sanofi Global Health Unit, dedicated to increasing access to 30 medicines considered essential by the WHO. Sanofi is uniquely positioned to make this difference to society, which can be scaled and sustained over time, given our portfolio of essential medicines and broad geographic presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Product sales</strong></p>
<p>In the first quarter, Dupixent (collaboration with Regeneron [Nasdaq: REGN]) sales were strong despite the COVID-19 environment and increased 45.6% to 1,047 million euros.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neurology and Immunology </strong>sales were down 3.4% to 581 million euros, impacted primarily by the decline of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aubagio (teriflunomide) sales decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to 500 million euros, due to lower sales in the USA reflecting increased competition partially offset by demand growth partly related to clinical trial supply and price upside in Europe. First-quarter Lemtrada sales decreased 44.9% to 24 million euros, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a decrease in infused immune reconstitution therapies such as Lemtrada.0</p>
<p>In the first quarter, <strong>Rare Disease</strong>&nbsp;sales increased 4.4% to 770 million euros, primarily driven by higher demand particularly in Rest of the World (up 10.2%). Sales in Europe increased 0.4% and compared to a high base in the first quarter of 2020 due to an inventory build related to the COVID-19 environment.</p>
<p>First-quarter Cerezyme (imiglucerase) sales increased 4.2% to 178 million euros, driven by strong growth in Rest of the World (up 18.4%).</p>
<p>In the first quarter, global <strong>Diabetes</strong>&nbsp;sales decreased 1.7% to 1,175 million euros. Toujeo (insulin glargine [rDNA origin]) sales increased 5.1% to 253 million euros driven by the launch in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular and Established Rx Products </strong>sales decreased 5.6% to 2.31 billion euros reflecting strong Lovenox (enoxaparin) growth more than offset in particular by lower sales of Aprovel/Avapro (irbesartan)<sup>&nbsp;</sup>divestments and some COVID impact.

<p>The US company expects to progress the candidates to investigational new drug (IND) submissions next year.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""We believe our ADCs may apply to a broad patient population as single agents and in combination with immunotherapies to further improve the outcome for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers""</span>They are PYX-201, a first-in-class non-internalizing ADC that targets extra domain-B (EDB) of fibronectin.</p>
<p>EDB is an oncofetal splice variant of fibronectin, a key component of the tumor extracellular matrix that is highly expressed across several solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers.</p>
<p>PYX-201 is designed to release an auristatin payload with bystander activity into the extracellular space to induce immunogenic cell death to kill tumor cells and their supporting infrastructure.</p>
<p>Then there is PYX-202, an internalizing ADC targeting delta-like 1 homolog, a tumor antigen that is restricted in normal tissues but expressed in a range of solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and neuroblastoma.</p>
<p>PYX-202 uses a well-understood toxic agent, monomethyl auristatin payload and a beta-glucuronide cleavable linker designed to increase stability in circulation and reduce off-target toxicities.</p>
<p>Another candidate is PYX-203, an internalizing ADC targeting CD123, a clinically-validated target primarily expressed in several high need hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and others.</p>
<p>PYX-203 utilizes a lysosomal cleavable linker and a highly potent cyclopropylpyrroloindole DNA-damaging payload that may reduce the drug concentration needed to achieve positive treatment outcomes while limiting unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>A larger patient population may benefit from PYX-203, including patients who otherwise would not respond to the standard of care, according to Pyxis.</p>
<p>Ronald Herbst, chief scientific officer of Pyxis, said: &ldquo;ADCs represent a promising therapeutic modality, but historically their advancement has been limited due to on and off-target toxicities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ADC assets have been specifically designed and developed using site-specific conjugation chemistry to combine new and established targets, linkers and payloads. All three candidates are potent with highly stable linker-payload conjugation &ndash; characteristics that have led to superior therapeutic indexes.

<p>In the decree, Mr Mishustin refers to the Russian Civil Code, which allows the use of such a mechanism in the interests of national security, while the patent holder will be provided with monetary compensation. The amount of compensation was not disclosed. This was the first time a compulsory license for the production of a drug was issued in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>State decision criticized by Gilead </strong></h2>
<p>Alexei Brevnov, PR-director of Gilead Sciences Russia, said in an interview with the Russian Vedomosti, that this decision is counterproductive, since the price set by the company for the drug already allows to reduce the cost of combating coronavirus in any country in the world.</p>
<p>According to Mr Brevnov, the information on the patents indicated in the compulsory license order contained inaccuracies. He added that there is also an unmet demand for Veklury in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to him, the demand for a generic is very limited, which indicates no urgent need for a compulsory licensing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Brevnov also said that the approach for determining the cost of this drug does not correspond to the pricing method for vital and essential drugs in the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before getting permission from the government, Pharmsynthez had talks with Gilead, but the latter refused to grant it a voluntary license, after which the Russian company made a request to the Russian government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its letter, Pharmsynthez referred to the high price of the original Veklury and promised to provide all patients who need the drug at a lower cost.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Questions on pricing</strong></h2>
<p>According to the government procurement website, since the beginning of 2021, Remdeform purchases have totalled more than 180 million roubles ($2.4 million). Over the same time, the original Veklury was not purchased. According to the register of maximum selling prices for vital and essential dugs the maximum cost of Remdeform should not exceed 7,400 roubles per pack while the price for Veklury last year was set at 11,544 roubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of interviewed lawyers believe Gilead has no chance of challenging the government's order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Sergei Uchitel, partner of the Pen &amp; Paper Bar Association, the main question to be resolved by the court is whether the conditions for issuing a compulsory license were met. These, according to him, include the presence of an emergency situation in the country or circumstances of extreme necessity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That became the first case for the issue of a compulsory license in the Russian pharmaceutical market. Prior to this, some local companies have made a number of attempts to receive such permissions. For example, Nativa has been trying for several years to obtain compulsory licenses in arbitration courts for the production of multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya (fingolimod), which is patented by the Swiss giant Novartis (NOVN: VX), as well as the anticancer drug Nexavar (sorafenib) from Germany&rsquo;s Bayer (BAYN: DE).</p>
<p>Analysts have not ruled out the possibility that Nativa will try to use the latest case as an argument, but they doubt the success of the case. In the situation with remdesivir, the issue of a compulsory license was more clear, due to the shortage of an original drug in the market and the impossibility of releasing an analogue due to the patent restrictions.</p>","2021-04-27 16:15:00","Gilead Sciences challenges compulsory licensing of its anti-COVID-19 d","Gilead Sciences, Challenge, Compulsory licensing, Veklury, Remdesivir, COVID-19, Pharmsynthez, Remdeform","Gilead Sciences challenges compulsory licensing of its anti-COVID-19 drug in Russia",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-27 16:12:18","2021-04-27 16:24:51",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gilead-sciences-to-challenge-compulsory-licensing-of-its-anti-covid-19-drug-in-russia,,,,,,gilead-big.jpg,gilead-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases","Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Patents & Trademarks, Russian market",Russia,"Gilead Sciences, Pharmsynthez","Remdeform, Remdesivir, Veklury",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In fact, the plans for localization of ingredients production in Russia were first announced about 10 years ago, although, so far a little progress in this field has been achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present about 80% of domestic drugs are produced on the basis of raw materials that are supplied to Russia from China and India, while in recent years the volume of such supplies has significantly increased, and the growth is currently ongoing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to data of RNC Pharma, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading analyst agencies in the field of pharmaceutics, in 2020 imports of active ingredients to Russia amounted to 167.1 billion roubles ($2.28 billion), which is 21% more than in 2019, and 42.5% higher than in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In volume terms, imports also grew up to 14.900 tonnes in 2020, which is 12% more than in 2019, and 24% higher, compared to 2018. At present more than 80% of Russian drugs are made from foreign active ingredients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to RNC Pharma, the main suppliers of active ingredients to Russia are China (with the share of 23.4% in value and 54.6% in volume terms) and India (11.2% and 22.5%, respectively).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alexander Semyonov, president of Active Component, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading producers of APIs, told in an interview with Kommersant business paper, that in order to reduce import dependence, it is necessary to build up the domestic chemical industry for the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, for example, by the provision of guarantees for sales of products and renewing state subsidies for the leasing of equipment for the needs of the industry.</p>","2021-04-27 14:04:00","Russian government to stimulate production of APIs","Russia, Government, Stimulation, Production, APIs, Ingredients, Vladimir Putin","Russian government to stimulate production of APIs",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-27 14:03:53","2021-04-27 14:10:14",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russian-government-to-stimulate-production-of-apis,,,,,,russia_lake_stock_large.jpg,russia_lake_stock_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Generics,"All therapy areas","Focus On, Government Affairs, Production, Russian market",Russia,"RNC Pharma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Net sales were $12.4 billion (+1%, -2% constant currency) in the first quarter driven by volume growth of 3 percentage points, price erosion of 2 percentage points and negative impact from generic competition of 3 percentage points. This compared to $12.5 billion forecast in the Refinitiv poll. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, Novartis estimates first quarter net sales grew 1% (cc, +4% USD).</p>
<p>Core net income was $3.4 billion (-4%, -6% cc) mainly driven by the decline in core operating income, compared to the $3.5 billion average estimates of nine analysts in a poll by Refinitiv. Core EPS was $1.52 (-3%, -5% cc), declining less than core net income, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Novartis confirmed its full-year 2021 outlook, which project net sales growing at a low- to mid-single-digit percentage rate, with core operating income expected to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate, ahead of sales.</p>
<p>Commenting on the quarter, Vas Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, said: <em>&ldquo;</em>Novartis growth drivers and launches continued their strong momentum with double-digit growth for Entresto, Cosentyx, Oncology growth drivers and Zolgensma. We expect Sandoz performance to stabilize, in the near-term, after a challenging quarter. Our broad pipeline of novel medicines continued to progress, with the US approval of Entresto across the full spectrum of chronic heart failure and the positive readout for our radioligand therapy in prostate cancer. Our progress on building trust with society has been recognized by top rankings on the Access to Medicines Index and Sustainalytics. We remain confident in progressing our leading pipeline and delivering our growth outlook.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Segment and product performances</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Innovative Medicine</strong> net sales were $10.1 billion (+4%, 0% cc) with volume contributing 4 percentage points. Generic competition had a negative impact of 4 percentage points.</p>
<p><strong>Sandoz </strong>net sales were $2.3 billion (-9%, -13% cc) with a negative price effect of 10 percentage points mainly due to increasing competition and prior year benefit from off-contract sales. Volume declined 3 percentage points from the impact of COVID-19 on prior year forward purchasing and softened retail demand, with a historically weak cough and cold season, partly offset by growth in Biopharmaceuticals. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, we estimate first quarter net sales declined -9% (cc, -5% USD).</p>
<p>Sales of Entresto (sacubitril and valsartan) were $789 million (+34% cc) with sustained strong growth and increased patient share across markets, driven by demand as the essential first choice therapy for heart failure patients.</p>
<p>Sales of Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) were $319 million (+81% cc) with a strong quarter and growth driven by Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, as well as ongoing geographic expansion.</p>
<p>Sales of Cosentyx (secukinumab) were $1.1 billion (+11% cc) and saw continued growth across indications despite access changes in the US and COVID-19 negatively impacting new patient starts.</p>
<p>Sales of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) at $151 million (+55% cc) grew strongly across all regions. Coverage continued to expand, with more than 300 qualified treatment centers in 28 countries.</p>
<p>Sales of Promacta/Revolade (eltrombopag) at $463 million (+13% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line for severe aplastic anemia in the USA.</p>","2021-04-27 12:00:00","Novartis 1st-quarter financials miss expectations","Novartis, 1st-quarter, 2021, Financial results, Sandoz, Entresto, Zolgensma, Cosentyx","Novartis 1st-quarter financials miss expectations",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-27 11:59:22","2021-04-27 12:08:59",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-1st-quarter-financials-miss-expectations,,,,,,2020_novartis_big.jpg,2020_novartis_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Cardio-vascular, Cell and Gene Therapy, Inflammatory diseases, Oncology, Rare diseases",Financial,Switzerland,"Novartis, Sandoz","Cosentyx, Entresto, Kymriah, Promacta, Zolgensma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>With initial hearings due to take place as early as Wednesday, AstraZeneca said the litigation was without merit, and that it would &ldquo;strongly defend itself in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>European leaders have been frustrated by a slow vaccine rollout, leading to pressure from EU member states and questions over the trading bloc&rsquo;s vaccine strategy.</p>
<p>Supplies of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Vaxzevria jab have been lower than anticipated, due to manufacturing delays, resulting in a geopolitical spat with erstwhile EU member, the UK.</p>
<p>Pointing to &ldquo;an unprecedented year of scientific discovery, very complex negotiations, and manufacturing challenges,&rdquo; AstraZeneca said it was making progress and that output was improving, adding: &ldquo;the production cycle of a vaccine is very long which means these improvements take time to result in increased finished vaccine doses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The firm said it had &ldquo;fully complied with the Advance Purchase Agreement with the European Commission.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Vaccine donations</h2>
<p>In the USA, where the vaccine rollout is proceeding apace, the White House has said it would supply around 60 million doses of Vaxzevria to other nations.</p>
<p>The product has not been approved and is not being used in the USA, leading to calls from other nations for current stockpiles to be released, despite a US blockade on vaccines.</p>
<p>Amid accusations of vaccine nationalism, and with geopolitical rivals China and Russia engaged in a vaccine-led diplomatic effort, the USA is now moving to offer more to lower-income nations.</p>
<p>The USA said it would provide doses of Vaxzevria to other countries in the coming months, once it has passed safety reviews by the US Food and Drug Administration, which should happen within weeks.</p>
<p>Around 10 million doses are available to be released pending a regulatory decision, with the rest expected to be delivered in May and June.

Pfizer, which of course was the first firm to gain regulatory approval in the western world for a COVID-19 vaccine, improved its positioning by three places by coming third.</p>
<p>New entrant Horizon Therapeutics (Nasdaq: HZNP) came fourth and Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD), which was involved in developing COVID-19 therapeutics with mixed success, was fifth, followed by Novartis (NOVN: VX) and Janssen.</p>
<p>The eighth-placed company, AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), climbed five places from the previous year, probably as a result of its involvement in developing a COVID-19 vaccine. AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Takeda (TYO: 4502) completed the top 10.</p>

<p>The research is entitled <a href=""https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Strengthening-the-Accelerated-Approval-Pathway-_-ICER-White-Paper-_-April-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""follow noopener"">Strengthening the Accelerated Approval Pathway: An Analysis of Potential Policy Reforms and Their Impact on Uncertainty, Access, Innovation, and Costs</a>.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""A good time to take stock""</span>This paper aims to create a clearer understanding of both the opportunities and challenges inherent in the US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s (FDA) accelerated approval pathway (AAP), and to present an analysis of the potential risks and benefits of a range of reform options that policymakers may consider in efforts to strengthen the AAP moving forward.</p>
<p>Steven Pearson, president of the ICER, said: &ldquo;Since 1992, the FDA&rsquo;s AAP has brought important new treatments to patients faster than would have been possible through the traditional approval process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The successes are many, and the benefits for patients overall have been substantial. But criticisms have emerged as well, including concerns that the FDA has lacked consistency in its application of evidentiary standards, and that the incentives and procedures in place today have proven inadequate to get high quality confirmatory trials completed in a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From various points on the spectrum, concerns are also raised that patients may not be getting fair access to these drugs, while some question whether the high prices for most of the drugs approved through this pathway are merited given the level of uncertainty about their effectiveness at launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So today, after nearly three decades of experience, it is a good time to take stock of where the AAP is, and what might be done to strengthen it. No policy reform options come without potential downsides, and the goal of our white paper is to outline the potential benefits and risks of major policy options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reforms considered by the paper include strengthening the selection of surrogate endpoints, developing standardized AAP templates to increase consistency and evidence standards, and requiring greater use of randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>Other changes weighed up are creating a new alert on the label of AAP therapies, tying economic incentives to the completion of confirmatory trials, changing the conditions for continued marketing approval if confirmatory evidence is not provided by a pre-determined date and offering a safety-only approval, without requirement of public or private insurance coverage, for treatments that have demonstrated safety but not an ability to improve patients&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>Finally, consideration is given to increasing mandatory federal rebate levels until time of full approval, pricing at marginal cost until confirmatory evidence reviewed, or allowing full market pricing at launch that reverts to marginal cost pricing if confirmatory trials are not completed in a reasonable timeframe, and requiring payment for AAP therapies be tied to outcomes-based contracts.</p>","2021-04-26 18:05:00",,"ICER, approval, paper, options, pricing, strengthening, potential, time, Drug, white, economic, confirmatory, patients, pathway, ponders, trials, FDA’s","US non-profit the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), in collaboration with researchers from the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Can",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-26 18:01:21","2021-04-26 21:18:17",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-ponders-options-for-strengthening-fda-s-aap,,,,,,icer_big.jpg,icer_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,ICER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Signatories want to know if private lobbying has influenced the UK&rsquo;s opposition to a waiver of intellectual property (IP) rules for COVID-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>
<p>Patient advocacy and vaccine equity organizations that have signed the statement include Global Justice Now, Just Treatment, StopAIDS, Frontline AIDS, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines UK, Students for Global Health, and Nurses United UK.</p>
<p>The statement argues that factories capable of producing vaccines are &ldquo;sitting idle&rdquo; as IP rules have restricted production of COVID-19 vaccines to the supply chains of patent-holding pharmaceutical companies, restricting production.</p>
<p>More than 100 countries have supported a temporary waiver of Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) at the WTO proposed by India and South Africa, but the move has been blocked by a small number of countries including the USA, UK, and European Union.</p>
<p>This cannot be defended, particularly in light of the desperate need for vaccines in all but a few of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest countries, campaigners say.</p>

488460,,"Former FDA official criticizes agency's guidance on drug reviews during COVID-19 pandemic","The US Food and Drug Administration’s recent guidance on new drug applications during the pandemic fails to address certain key issues, according to a former top FDA official.","<p>The US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s recent guidance on new drug applications during the pandemic fails to address certain key issues, according to a former top FDA official.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/development-abbreviated-new-drug-applications-during-covid-19-pandemic-questions-and-answers"">guidance</a> provides applicants with recommendations for navigating the product review process in a Q&amp;A format. Topics covered include generic drug product development, submission and assessment of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and marketing and exclusivity.</p>
<p>However, according to Eva Temkin, former FDA Acting Director for Policy at the Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars, the guidance is silent on important topics that have arisen over the last year and which will continue to be relevant in 2021.</p>
<p>Ms Temkin, who recently joined law firm King &amp; Spalding as a partner with the FDA &amp; Life Sciences team, has co-authored a new alert on the FDA guidance. In the article, she discusses the areas that are covered by the guidance, but concludes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, the COVID Q&amp;A guidance may be more notable for what it did not say than for what it said. The guidance talks about developing generic drugs and submitting ANDAs, but it is silent regarding the development of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products and the submission of 351(k) BLAs. Stakeholders are left to wonder whether the principles outlined in the COVID Q&amp;A Guidance can inform treatment of follow-on biologics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guidance also stops short of saying whether, or how, loss of market exclusivity due to inspection-related delays amid Covid might be evaluated.</p>

<p>The approval makes dostarlimab the first anti-PD-1 therapy available for endometrial cancer in Europe, GSK noted.</p>
<p>Dr Hal Barron, chief scientific officer and president R&amp;D, GSK, said: &ldquo;Women with recurrent endometrial cancer, or advanced disease that has progressed on or after chemotherapy, currently have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Today&rsquo;s approval of dostarlimab means that for the first time in Europe, these women will have access to a new, innovative and much-needed therapy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Ana Oaknin, head of the gynecologic cancer program at Vall d&rsquo;Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Vall d&rsquo;Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, and primary investigator for the GARNET Trial, said: &ldquo;As we saw in the pivotal GARNET trial that supported this approval, treatment with dostarlimab has the potential to provide clinically significant and durable responses in patients who formerly had few treatment options. This approval represents a step forward, providing a new treatment for women with recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer who have previously failed a platinum-based chemotherapy.&rdquo;</p>

The patient had multiple risk factors associated with HCC, including a 25-year history of hepatitis C (HCV), history of hepatitis B (HBV). Chronic infections with hepatitis B and C have been associated with approximately 80% of HCC cases.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>All patients in uniQure&rsquo;s hemophilia B gene therapy program, including the 54 patients in HOPE-B, have had abdominal ultrasounds performed one year after dosing, and each will continue to be monitored by their care teams.

<p>Given the increasing availability of vaccines authorized for emergency use, the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD(HA)) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA), will discontinue funding for the Phase III segment of the INNOVATE trial, while continuing to fund the completion of the ongoing Phase II segment, said Innovio.</p>

<h2><strong>Result of changing environment</strong></h2>
<p>In correspondence, the JPEO informed Inovio: ""The decision results from the changing environment of COVID-19 with the rapid deployment of vaccines. This decision is not a reflection of the awardee or product, rather a fast-moving environment associated with the former Operation Warp Speed on decisions related to future products.""</p>
<p>This decision does not impact other work that Inovio does with the US government and is neither a result of the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-hitch-for-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-ino-4800-phase-ii-iii-trial"">partial clinical hold</a> imposed by the Food and Drug Administration last year, nor a reflection of the data generated to date for INO-4800 vaccine.</p>
<p>Inovio continues to evaluate its pan-COVID variant vaccine, INO-4802, to protect against current and future variants of concern, as well as assessing boosting capabilities for INO-4800. Inovio remains well-positioned to support both pandemic and endemic vaccine needs with INO-4800 and INO-4802. INOVIO and its partners and collaborators look forward to being part of the global solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 &ndash; including both current and future variants.</p>","2021-04-26 12:04:00","Inovio tanks as govt funding for COVID-19 vaccine withdrawn","Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Funding, Government, COVID-19 vaccine, INO-4800, Withdrawn","Inovio tanks as govt funding for COVID-19 vaccine withdrawn",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-26 12:03:02","2021-04-26 13:54:08",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/inovio-tanks-as-govt-funding-for-covid-19-vaccine-withdrawn,,,,,,inovio-big-1.jpg,inovio-small-1.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Financial, Focus On, Government Affairs, Research",USA,"Inovio Pharmaceuticals","COVID-19, INO-4800",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

RSV is the most common cause of LRTI and the leading cause of hospitalizations in all infants.","<p>Positive to-line results from the Phase III MELODY trial showed nirsevimab reduced lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring medical attention (inpatient or outpatient) due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in healthy preterm and term infants. RSV is the most common cause of LRTI and the leading cause of hospitalizations in all infants.</p>
<p>Nirsevimab reached its primary endpoint, achieving a statistically-significant absolute reduction of LRTI caused by RSV in healthy preterm and term infants compared to placebo through a typical RSV season. No clinically-meaningful differences in safety results between the nirsevimab and placebo groups were seen. The overall safety profile of nirsevimab in the trial remains consistent with previously reported results.</p>
<p>Results will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress&nbsp;and are anticipated to form the basis of regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>Nirsevimab is a long-acting antibody, using UK pharma major AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) proprietary YTE technology, and being developed by AstraZeneca and French major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN), with the potential to provide immunity directly to infants and offer immediate protection against RSV. It is the first potential immunization to show protection against RSV in the general infant population in a Phase III trial. Nirsevimab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in the USA and PRIME designation in Europe.</p>
<h2><strong>Competition in passive vaccination approach</strong></h2>
<p>The Anglo-French partnership is not the only one pursuing the passive vaccination approach, with rival options under development from Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK), with MK-1654, as well as GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). USA-based vaccine specialist Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is also still in the running with its aluminum-adjuvanted RSV F vaccine ResVax, despite a Phase III setback.</p>
<p>Dr William Muller, Associate Professor, Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Scientific Director, Clinical and Community Trials, Ann &amp; Robert H Lurie Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Chicago, Illinois, US and primary investigator of the MELODY Phase III trial, commented: &ldquo;Despite respiratory syncytial virus being the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in the first year of life, there is no routine preventative option currently approved for all infants. These exciting trial data demonstrate the potential for nirsevimab to change the prevention landscape not only by providing protection to a broad population of infants across the full respiratory syncytial virus season, but also by achieving this with a single dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nirsevimab is the first investigational extended half-life monoclonal antibody (MAb) aiming to protect all infants entering their first RSV season, when they are at highest risk for severe RSV disease. With nirsevimab, a protective antibody is administered directly to the infant with the goal of providing rapid protection.</p>
<p>In contrast to other options for RSV under development, such as maternal vaccines, nirsevimab was designed to be administered at birth to infants born&nbsp;during&nbsp;the&nbsp;RSV season or at the season&rsquo;s&nbsp;start for infants born&nbsp;prior to the&nbsp;season.</p>
<p>Nirsevimab is a long-acting antibody and is the first potential immunization to show protection against RSV in the general infant population in a Phase III trial.</p>
<p>Mene Pangalos, executive vice president, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D at AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;These ground-breaking results mark a major scientific advancement in our effort to provide protection against respiratory syncytial virus for all infants. Nearly all children will contract the virus before age two, leading to nearly 30 million acute lower respiratory tract infections globally each year. Nirsevimab has the potential to provide a significant public health benefit as the first respiratory syncytial virus immunisation for the general infant population, and these data bring us one step closer to delivering nirsevimab to infants worldwide.&rdquo;</p>

488448,,"Novartis’ ‘full-court press’ key to ensuring rapid Zolgensma access","Having a treatment that, the data show, can save the lives of babies and children facing an otherwise grim outlook is an excellent starting point for ensuring swift reimbursement for a product, but by no means is it a guarantee.","<p>Having a treatment that, the data show, can save the lives of babies and children facing an otherwise grim outlook is an excellent starting point for ensuring swift reimbursement for a product, but by no means is it a guarantee.</p>
<p>That is why Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) has done more than just present outstanding data on the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) to ensure that families gain access as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Despite regulatory approval coming less than a year ago, agreements for reimbursement in European countries, including Italy and different parts of the UK, have been announced recently, and there is also temporary availability in Germany and France, where negotiations about permanent access are ongoing.</p>
<p>Indeed, the May 2020 European Commission approval came at the same time as the activation of access programs for Zolgensma in SMA in certain countries.</p>
<h2>Bespoke solutions for each country</h2>
<p>Agreeing such rapid access is remarkable for a therapy with such a high price tag - with its US wholesale acquisition cost set by Novartis of $2.125 million paid over five years meaning it was labelled the &lsquo;most expensive drug ever&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mike Fraser, general manager of Europe, Middle East and Africa for Novartis Gene Therapies, told The Pharma Letter how the company has gone about achieving this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the data speak for themselves, the challenge we had was convincing people of the value of a one-time therapy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you had to amortize that over the period of a life, then you realize the value of a product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain countries&rsquo; stated ambition to be leaders in innovation, such as the UK and Italy, made them willing to engage enthusiastically with Novartis from the outset, and the collaborative approach taken by the company and health systems have led these discussions to be productive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been very flexible in bespoke solutions that we have offered,&rdquo; Mr Fraser added. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the same solution in every country. We went public last year and spoke about things like annuity-type models, where it works for those countries, and various other types of models, so innovative models, to help them. That has also been super-important.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Wealth not a prerequisite for access&nbsp;</h2>
<p>These unique and bespoke reimbursement solutions can also be seen in the rest of the world where access has been agreed, such as the USA, Japan and Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have proven that we have been flexible in terms of the results that we have been able to get across the world,&rdquo; Mr Fraser said, and he stressed that it was not just authorities in the world&rsquo;s wealthiest nations that Novartis has been successfully engaging with.</p>
<p>The company is in very deep negotiations with nations in central and eastern Europe, for example, and is working in very close collaboration with their health authorities, in the expectation of announcing access agreements soon.</p>
<p>Collaboration not just with the health authorities but with the whole ecosystem can be so important in rare diseases, Mr Fraser stressed, and he listed patient advocacy groups, healthcare practitioners and politicians as other interested parties that Novartis has forged close relationships with to get them working together on Zolgensma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A basketball terminology would be a full-court press,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Getting the whole ecosystem to work very collaboratively together.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>'Breaking through a new frontier'</h2>
<p>Encouragingly, Novartis&rsquo; work on achieving rapid reimbursement with Zolgensma could point the way for other gene therapies and transformative treatments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a lot of people in the field and we are getting a lot of feedback, saying &ldquo;you guys are opening the doors for us&rdquo;,&rdquo; Mr Fraser added. &ldquo;It is such an exciting time because I would say we are breaking through a new frontier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fixed-dose nasal spray is approved for the first line treatment of allergic rhinitis in people over the age of 12, and Glenmark will commercialize the product independently in select markets.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s Menarini will lead the commercialization effort in certain markets, including Italy, Spain and France, under the terms of a 2021 deal, for which Glenmark received an upfront payment and is eligible for further milestone payments.</p>
<p>Glenmark has also partnered with Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK) and Bausch Health (TSX: BHC) for the commercialization of Ryaltris in the USA and Canada respectively.</p>
<p>Ryaltris first won marketing approval in 2019, with partner Seqirus gaining the nod from Australia&rsquo;s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), and has been approved in multiple other countries since, including South Korea, Russia and South Africa.</p>
<h2>R&amp;D focus</h2>
<p>Glenmark, a Mumbai-based company, has a long history as a developer of generic medicines for the local market and for countries around the world.</p>
<p>Ryaltris represents the firm&rsquo;s flagship program under a strategy to invest more in R&amp;D, with the goal of building up a pipeline of innovative drugs.</p>
<p>As part of that strategy, the firm&rsquo;s board agreed in 2019 to spin out its R&amp;D unit into an independent, fully integrated biotechnology company, dubbed Ichnos Sciences.</p>
<p>Currently funded by Glenmark, the company launched in New Jersey, USA, with former Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) executive Dr Alessandro Riva at the helm, and is expected to consider going public at some point.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest approval, regional business head Achin Gupta said: ""Despite many treatments being available for allergic rhinitis, Glenmark is excited to launch Ryaltris as the only first line combination inhaler treatment option for patients across Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Upwards of 25% of the population in Europe suffers from the debilitating symptoms of allergic rhinitis, so we hope that Ryaltris will bring some of these real benefits - a simple inhaler, offering fast and effective relief.""</p>","2021-04-26 10:15:00",,"Glenmark, Ryaltris, approval, European, Pharmaceuticals, strategy, innovative, seal, innovation, Indian, maker, leading, major, step, boosting, credentials","Famous as a leading Indian maker of generics, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has taken a major step towards boosting its credentials in the innovative medicine space,",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-26 10:00:18","2021-04-26 10:16:04",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/european-seal-of-approval-for-glenmark-s-innovation-strategy,,,,,,glenmark_big.jpg,glenmark_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Immunologicals, Respiratory and Pulmonary","Asia Pacific, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation, Research","Europe, India","Glenmark Pharmaceuticals",Ryaltris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Notable news last week included Australia&rsquo;s Kazia Therapeutics entering a licensing deal with Germany&rsquo;s Evotec for worldwide rights to cancer candidate EVT801. French vaccine specialist Valneva has started Phase III evaluation of its COVID-19 candidate VLA200 in the UK. US biotech bluebird bio gave an update on its genetic disease portfolio last Tuesday and said it was withdrawing its beta thalassemia drug Zynteglo from the German market due to failed price negotiations. GlaxoSmithKline was granted US Food and Drug Administration approval for its checkpoint blocker Jemperli. Also, on Friday the FDA lifted its pause on the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.</p>
<h2><strong>Kazia Therapeutics: New asset to target tumor lymphangiogenesis</strong></h2>
<p>Kazia announced that it has licensed the compound EVT801 from Evotec. The deal included 1 million euros ($1.2 million) upfront for Evotec, 308 million euros in milestones, and tiered single-digit royalties. Kazia will assume all development, regulatory and marketing responsibilities, commented Edison Group analysts</p>
<p>However, Kazia noted that it would be collaborating with Evotec and will have access to Evotec resources such as clinical trial management and manufacturing as part of a services agreement. The company noted that the initial focus of development will be for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS).</p>
<p>Strategically, this is an important deal for Kazia, because it enables it to expand the pipeline to multiple drugs. Paxalisib will remain the lead asset, but most of the operational burden of that development is borne by the investigators running GBM AGILE. This leaves capacity for the company to expand its offering.</p>
<p>The analysts have increased their valuation to A$346 million ($268 million) or A$2.68 per basic share from A$301 million or A$2.32 per basic share due to the new drug (initial valuation of A$47.2 million). This has also increased expected R&amp;D spending significantly and their financing requirement for the company to A$50 million (including A$30 million in FY23) from A$10 million, previously.</p>
<h2><strong>Valneva joins the Phase III COVID-19 vaccine club</strong></h2>
<p>As the world awaits pivotal US data on Novavax&rsquo; COVID-19 jab, plenty of other players are still trying to get in on the second wave of vaccines, said Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage. One of the latest, Valneva pushed VLA2001 into a pivotal UK study, while Ocugen hopes that its contender, Covaxin, could get the nod in the US on the back of data from a Phase III trial in India. The latter&rsquo;s share price climbed 18% yesterday.</p>
<p>Both vaccines are based on inactivated coronavirus, making them different from currently authorised shots. With concerns over unusual blood clots with adenoviral vector-based vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, perhaps it is not too late for some of the Covid-19 vaccine laggards to make a mark, especially if booster doses are eventually needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Valneva has beaten some more experienced players to Phase III. Its study will compare the immune response with VLA2001 versus that seen with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Vaxzevria in 4,000 UK participants.</p>
<p>One question is whether this trial will support approval outside the UK, but maybe this will not matter to Valneva for now. Only the UK has gone big on VLA2001 so far, ordering 100 million doses. The company <a href=""https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-switches-focus-to-bilateral-discussions-to-supply-its-inactivated-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-vla2001/"">recently ditched discussions with the European Commission</a>, citing lack of progress, and hopes to sell its project to individual EU member states and countries outside the EU.</p>
<h2><strong>Zynteglo marketing update incremental; clinical hold resolution remains focus</strong></h2>
<p>bluebird bio announced last Tuesday the decision to withdraw Zynteglo from the German market after the company could not reach a reimbursement agreement with Germany that reflected Zynteglo&rsquo;s value for treatment of transfusion-dependent &beta;-thalassemia (TDT), noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Dr Mani Foroohar.</p>
<p>The decision does not change our estimates, as we assumed a prolonged pause in marketing of Zynteglo following suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions reported in the sickle cell clinical program, and assumed sales would resume in 2022. Negotiations continue in additional European geographies, and reimbursement in areas of greater TDT prevalence (Italy, for example) will be key drivers of the revenue opportunity (though he notes that, in any scenario, the sickle cell opportunity remains the primary area of investor focus). Dr Foroohar makes no changes to his model at this time, and maintain his Outperform rating on BLUE shares.</p>
<p>Leerink spoke to bluebird management, and expects that Germany as a market can be considered off of the table for the time being. Negotiations are continuing in other European countries, and it would expect additional updates in the second half of 2021. Germany is a small market for TDT and harbors few patients (for epidemiological reasons), and discontinuation/delay of TDT sales in Germany has a negligible impact on the overall opportunity. On the other hand, TDT is prevalent in Italy and Greece and maintaining pricing that reflects the value of Zynteglo in these geographies will be crucial to realizing long-term sales projections and protecting the market positioning for the sickle cell indication, in our view. Dr Foroohar looks to resolution of the clinical hold and further updates on EU commercialization as the next key events for bluebird shares.</p>
<h2><strong>Jemperli arrives just as accelerated approvals face a grilling</strong></h2>
<p>With last Thursday&rsquo;s green light for GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s dostarlimab, some five months late owing to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the industry has its seventh US-approved anti-PD-(L)1 drug, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>The initial use, second-line mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancer, is a small niche, and Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda can already be given for second-line MSI-high/mismatch repair-deficient cancers &ndash; irrespective of tumour type. Immediate winners are Roche, whose Ventana MMR RxDx companion diagnostic is concurrently approved, and Anaptysbio, which scored a $20 million milestone payment; GlaxoSmithKline investors might now wonder how long it will be before dostarlimab, now branded Jemperli, generates the cash flow to cover the milestone. <em>Evaluate Pharma</em> sell-side consensus sees Jemperli revenues rising from an anemic $37 million this year to $546 million in 2026. The conditional approval came five days before a US adcom seeking to scrutinize the ongoing accelerated approvals of anti-PD-(L)1 drugs whose confirmatory studies have failed. As a just-published <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/thought-leadership/vantage/evaluate-vantage-report-us-approvals-under-spotlight"">report from <em>Evaluate Vantage</em></a> reveals, this conditional pathway has found particular favor with anti-PD-(L)1 drugs, with Keytruda alone having 18 accelerated approvals to its name, 11 of which remain unconfirmed. Jemperli plus chemo is in RUT, a controlled Phase III cancer study that might be used to confirm yesterday&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>Also commenting, Pharmaphorum noted that, after a string of disappointments including the failure of bintrafusp alfa, a drug developed with Germany&rsquo;s Merck KGaA in lung cancer, any approval is welcome news. While some argued that GSK overpaid for Tesaro in 2018, at least the deal is bringing badly needed new drugs to market for the under-pressure UK pharma and its highly-paid research chief Hal Barron.</p>
<p>Jemperli has been approved in a niche where there are few available options, in women whose endometrial cancer has progressed on or after platinum chemotherapy and whose cancers have a biomarker known as a mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR).</p>
<p>Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is the top seller and while it&rsquo;s unlikely Jemperli will generate the level of blockbuster revenues, GSK needs to get drugs approved to boost confidence in its pipeline.</p>
<h2><strong>ACIP recommends J&amp;J vax again; CDC and FDA provide cautions but no restrictions</strong></h2>
<p>On Friday, the CDC&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/in-brief/brief-us-pause-on-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-lifted"">reinstate its recommendation on Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</a> for all adults without any specific restrictions by age or gender, commented analysts at SVB Leerink Research.</p>
<p>The CDC and FDA are planning to communicate the risks of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)/ Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) in updated patient and physician information brochures and a new edition of MMWR early next week. The rate of this rare severe complication appears to be 1 in 143k vaccinees for women under 50 years of age, which the panel agreed was much lower than the rate of other rare but severe vaccine adverse events, and lower than the rate of complications of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The panel&rsquo;s recommendation appears to prioritize public health and social objectives over individual safety concerns, which may turn out to be controversial as anti-vax sentiment gathers momentum and could relegate J&amp;J primarily to emerging markets and poorly resourced environments in the USA, where risk/reward remains compelling.</p>
<p>For the time being at least, J&amp;J will be back in the market (assuming supply from their European facility), somewhat reducing the volume windfall for mRNA vaccine manufacturers. Reinstatement could have favorable regulatory read-through for AZN, especially given factors considered by the panel including ease of storage, distribution, and administration, attributes also shared by AZN&rsquo;s vaccine. We expect this re-recommendation will reverse momentum in the mRNA stocks that have been on a dramatic upward swing in April with ~$50 billion total market cap gain across BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer, and CurVac.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly for J&amp;J, this is the best-case scenario as it can return to market without restrictions. That said, the two biggest questions in the analysts&rsquo; minds gating US adoption are: (1) Willingness to adopt, as these negative headlines only exacerbate vaccination fears; and (2) ability to supply given recent 483 at supplier Emergent Biosciences. As it relates to the former, they do think given the ease of distribution and single-shot profile, J&amp;J&rsquo;s vaccine will be adopted in the more difficult-to-reach communities and populations and &mdash; beyond the US &mdash; developing countries.</p>
<p>And, from a manufacturing perspective, J&amp;J has capacity at its Netherlands facility, while simultaneously working with Emergent to resolve FDA&rsquo;s issues and other companies to secure additional supply contracts. Given that JNJ is selling not-for-profit and the company has already realized significant costs in 2020 that won't carry into 2021, we expect any negative impact on P&amp;L, if any, to be immaterial, and marginally incremental upside to revenue in 2021.</p>","2021-04-25 11:15:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 23, 2021","News review, Kazia Therapeutics, Evotec, EVT801, Valneva, VLA200, bluebird bio, Zynteglo, GlaxoSmithKline, Jemperi, Johnson & Johnson, COVID-19 Janssen","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 23, 2021",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-25 11:13:27","2021-04-25 14:43:02",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-23-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Cell and Gene Therapy, Infectious diseases, Oncology, Rare diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Deals, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"bluebird bio, Evotec, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Kazia Therapeutics, Valneva","COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, EVT801, Jemperli, VLA2001, Zynteglo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The drug is cleared for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p>Zynlonta is the first and only CD19-targeted antibody drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of r/r DLBCL. Zynlonta fills a significant unmet need in r/r DLBCL in heavily pre-treated patients with difficult to treat disease and has the potential to become the standard of care in 3L+ DLBCL. The 3L+ DLBCL total market consists of 10,500 patients in the USA/EU5 and represents a $1 billion+ opportunity, according to the company.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The accelerated approval of Zynlonta, which came ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of May 21, is based on data from the LOTIS-2 trial, which demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robust single-agent activity across a broad patient population;</li>
<li>48.3% overall response rate, 24.1% complete response rate, durable responses in heavily pre-treated patients;</li>
<li>Median duration of response of more than 10.3 months (BLA submission); 12.6 months for all responders and 13.4 months for patients who had a complete response (more mature data since the submission); and</li>
<li>Manageable toxicity profile</li>
</ul>
<p>The FDA approval is strong validation of the company&rsquo;s ADC platform and lead product, which also has the potential to be used in combination and in additional indications and lines of treatment, the company noted. ADC Therapeutics&rsquo; proprietary PBD dimer toxins make Zynlonta highly potent. The PBDs cross link in the DNA of cancer cells, enabling them to elude DNA repair/cancer resistance mechanisms. This allows for a longer-lasting effect on cancer cells.</p>
<p>Zynlonta will be commercially available in the USA shortly.

<h2><strong>Scaled-up processes for BioNTech/Pfizer&rsquo;s vaccine</strong></h2>
<p>The EMA has approved an increase in batch size and associated process scale up at Pfizer&rsquo;s (NYSE: PFE) vaccine manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium. The recommendation by the Agency&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/chmp"">CHMP</a> is expected to have a significant impact on the supply of Comirnaty, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Germany&rsquo;s BioNTech (Nasdaq (BNTX) and Pfizer, in the European Union.</p>
<p>Based on the review of the data submitted by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, the application to increase the batch size of the finished product manufactured at the Puurs site has been approved. The EMA&rsquo;s decision reaffirms that the Puurs facility is capable of consistently producing high-quality vaccines and enables Pfizer/BioNTech to scale up the production process at this site.</p>
<h2><strong>New filling line for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/chmp"">CHMP</a> also recommended the approval of a new filling line at Moderna&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: MRNA) finished product manufacturing site for the EU in Rovi, Spain.

<p>The 32-week data has been presented at the American Academy of Dermatology 2021 virtual meeting experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to present the results from Voltaire-X, a landmark study that supports Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s application for interchangeability between Cyltezo and Humira,&rdquo; said Thomas Seck, senior vice president, medicine and regulatory affairs at Boehringer Ingelheim. &ldquo;This first-of-its-kind switching study further reinforces our goal to broaden access to biosimilar treatment options while contributing to the quality and sustainability of healthcare systems,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>To be designated as an interchangeable product by the US Food and Drug Administration, a biosimilar must also be &ldquo;expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient&rdquo; and &ldquo;not present greater risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy from alternating or switching&rdquo; between the interchangeable candidate and reference product.</p>
<h2><strong>Importance of interchangeable designation</strong></h2>
<p>A biosimilar with an interchangeable designation can be substituted by a pharmacist for the reference product, in this case AbbVie&rsquo;s (NYSE: ABBV) mega-blockbuster Humira, without involving the prescriber, consistent with state law.</p>
<p>These results continue to build on the existing analytical, pharmacological, non-clinical similarity data as well as the clinical data in Crohn&rsquo;s Disease and in the rheumatoid arthritis population, which were used to support the approval of Cyltezo by the FDA in 2017.</p>
<p>Boehringer has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Cyltezo for designation as an interchangeable biosimilar to Humira. The action date is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Cyltezo is not commercially available in the USA at this time, but, following resolution of all intellectual property-related litigation in 2019 with AbbVie concerning the biosimilar, the German drugmaker reached a settlement on a license period for Cyltezo to begin on July 1, 2023, a date that places Boehringer Ingelheim among the first companies to bring an alternative treatment option to Humira to US patients.</p>","2021-04-24 14:29:00","Boehringer says data supports interchangeability of Cyltezo with Humir","Boehringer Ingelheim, Interchangeability, Cyltezo, Humira, Phase III, sBLA, Filing, Plaque psoriasis","Boehringer says data supports interchangeability of Cyltezo with Humira",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-24 14:27:59","2021-04-24 14:36:05",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/boehringer-says-data-supports-interchangeability-of-cyltezo-with-humira,,,,,,boehringer_headquarters_flags_large.jpg,boehringer_headquarters_flags_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biosimilars,"Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Dermatologicals, Inflammatory diseases","Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA","Germany, USA","AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim","Cyltezo, Humira",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>When administered early on during COVID-19, Virafin will help patients recover faster and avoid many of the complications, the company claims.</p>
<p>Virafin, which has shown efficacy in Phase II and Phase III trials, will be available on the prescription of medical specialists for use in India&rsquo;s hospitals, many of which are struggling to cope with the volume of COVID-19 patients. New cases currently number around 300,000 per day in the Asian country.</p>

<p>A final decision regarding the approvals is announced by the European Commission, which usually takes two to three months.</p>
<p>The Committee gave a positive opinion for Swiss pharma giant <strong>Roche&rsquo;s</strong> (ROG: SIX) <strong>Enspryng</strong> (satralizumab) for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in patients from 12 years of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) seropositive. AQP4-IgG are present in around 70%-80% of people with NMOSD, who tend to experience a more severe disease course.</p>
<p>NMOSD is a rare and life-threatening condition and most commonly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. This disorder can lead to reduction or loss of vision, loss of sensation, loss of bowel and bladder control, weakness and paralysis of the arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>Evkeeza</strong> (evinacumab), from US biotech <strong>Regeneron</strong> (Nasdaq: REGN), was granted a positive opinion by the Committee for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Evkeeza was reviewed under EMA&rsquo;s accelerated assessment programme.</p>
<p>The Committee recommended granting a marketing authorization for Danish drugmaker <strong>LEO Pharma&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>Adtralza</strong> (tralokinumab), for the treatment&nbsp;of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Koselugo</strong> (selumetinib), from the UK&rsquo;s <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> (LSE: AZN), was granted a positive opinion for the treatment of pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PN).</p>
<p>The Committee adopted a positive opinion for<strong> Onureg</strong> (azacitidine), from US major <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb</strong> (NYSE: BMY), for the maintenance treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. If approved, Onureg will become the first and only once daily oral frontline maintenance therapy in Europe for patients with a broad range of AML subtypes, says major Bristol Myers.</p>
<p><strong>Generic and hybrid drug opinions</strong></p>
<p>The CHMP recommended granting marketing authorizations for two generic medicines: <strong>Abiraterone Krka </strong>(abiraterone acetate), from KRKA, for the treatment of adult men with metastatic prostate cancer and <strong>Celsunax</strong> (ioflupane (<sup>123</sup>I)), from <strong>Pinax Pharma</strong>, intended for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum.</p>
<p>The Committee recommended granting a marketing authorization for <strong>Nova Laboratories&rsquo;</strong> hybrid medicine <strong>Jayempi</strong> (azathioprine) intended for prophylaxis against transplant rejection and as immunosuppressive antimetabolite either alone or in combination with other agents to influence the immune response in a variety of diseases. Hybrid applications rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials of an already authorized reference product and in part on new data.</p>

488436,,"Europe threatens legal action over AstraZeneca vaccine supplies","The latest chapter in an ongoing saga over European supplies of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine looks likely to involve legal action.","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The latest chapter in an </span><a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/eu-uk-covid-19-vaccines-spat-turns-to-outright-war""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ongoing saga</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> over European supplies of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) coronavirus vaccine looks likely to involve legal action.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The European Commission is reportedly asking the 27 EU member states to back litigation against the British firm, which it says is in breach of contractual obligations to supply the product, Vaxzevria.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">AstraZeneca has said it inked a so-called &ldquo;best efforts&rdquo; contract with Europe, and that supply chain disruptions prevented it from supplying the estimated amount.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While Europe has received just 30 million doses, the UK has used an exclusive arrangement with the drugmaker, agreed early on in development of the product, to vaccinate a far larger share of its population.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Long-running dispute</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the vaccine rollout in Europe proceeding slowly, officials threatened to block vaccine exports in February, raising concerns over &ldquo;vaccine nationalism.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The EU has said AstraZeneca should divert supplies from its UK supply chain to fulfill what it sees as a legal obligation to provide more.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With tensions rising, the UK and EU agreed in March to discuss &ldquo;what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on COVID-19.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those discussions appear not to have dissuaded the EU from pursuing a hard line on the matter. The trading bloc is counting on receiving 70 million vaccine doses from AstraZeneca in the second quarter of 2021.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Vaccine safety monitoring</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the EU fights to secure supplies of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccine, which was first approved by the UK regulator in December 2020, several countries have restricted its use to older populations amid concerns over a rare side effect of blood clotting.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Scientists are unclear whether a small number of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) cases are linked to the use of the viral vector-based product, partly due to uncertainty over how widespread the rare condition is among the general population.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In an update on Thursday, the UK&rsquo;s medicines regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it had found 168 major blood clots following a dose of Vaxzevria - equal to 7.9 clots per million doses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There have been over 20 million doses of the product given in the UK, and public health authorities around the world have confirmed the vaccine to be safe and effective.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a statement, the MHRA said: ""On the basis of this ongoing review, the advice remains that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The agency has, however, recommended that people under 30 be offered an alternative type of vaccine.</span></p>","2021-04-23 11:42:00",,"vaccine, supplies, legal, Europe, AstraZeneca, action, product, million, doses, European, ongoing, supply, saga, coronavirus, involve, latest, chapter, rar","The latest chapter in an ongoing saga over European supplies of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine looks like to involve legal action.",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-23 11:40:33","2021-04-23 12:07:53",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/europe-threatens-legal-action-over-astrazeneca-vaccine-supplies,,,,,,astrazeneca_big.jpg,astrazeneca_small-1.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Legal, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Production, Public health","Europe, UK",AstraZeneca,"COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Uplinza is the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-CD19 B-cell depleting humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of adult patients with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive NMOSD.</p>
<p>Horizon picked up rights to Uplinza along with its $3.05 <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/horizon-therapeutics-buys-viela-bio-for-3-05-billion"">acquisition of Viela Bio</a>, which was announced in February this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal of the open-label extension period was to better understand the long-term administration of Uplinza beyond the 28-week time frame that was originally studied in the randomized controlled period of the trial,&rdquo; said Dr Bruce Cree, professor of clinical neurology at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences and primary study investigator. &ldquo;These data are important because they provide further evidence that Uplinza can safely be used by NMOSD patients for an extended period of time, for at least four years, and that the medicine provides a sustained effect on attack risk,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Key OLP safety findings include:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Treatment with Uplinza was generally well-tolerated for at least four years.</li>
<li>No new safety signals were identified with prolonged Uplinza treatment and Uplinza-mediated B-cell depletion.</li>
<li>Rates of infection or serious infection did not increase with prolonged Uplinza treatment.</li>
<li>Levels of immunoglobins declined over time and continued to fall up to five years after the start of the OLP. No clear association between low IgG levels and severe infection can be established.</li>
<li>Infusion-related reactions during the N-MOmentum trial were generally mild, with no unexpected safety concerns identified during continued dosing in the OLP (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findex.mirasmart.com%2FAAN2021%2FPDFfiles%2FAAN2021-001941.html&amp;esheet=52412895&amp;newsitemid=20210416005099&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=P15.211&amp;index=3&amp;md5=ba610876058033012937c709a9f555a2"">P15.211</a>).</li>

<p>The therapy has been approved for the treatment of certain adults with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer, as a second-line option after chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Chief scientific officer Hal Barron said the decision &ldquo;has the potential to transform the treatment landscape for these women and demonstrates our continued commitment to helping patients with gynecologic cancers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The approval is based on results from the GARNET study, which represents the largest dataset to date evaluating an anti-PD-1 antibody as monotherapy treatment in women with endometrial cancer.</p>
<p>Jemperli, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in this indication in May 2019, was approved under the FDA&rsquo;s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program, and under a Priority Review.</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Originally developed by USA-based AnaptysBio (Nasdaq: ANAB), the therapy was licensed to fellow American firm Tesaro in 2014, under the terms of a strategic immuno-oncology collaboration.</p>
<p>GSK picked up the compound through its $5.1 billion acquisition of Tesaro, completed in early 2019, part of a broader push into the oncology space.</p>
<p>AnaptysBio is due a $20 million milestone payment following FDA approval, and another $45 million plus $165 million in regulatory and commercial milestones, plus between 8% and 25% royalties on net sales.</p>
<h2>Accelerated Approval</h2>
<p>GSK picked up the green light under the US FDA&rsquo;s Accelerated Approval scheme, based on tumor response rate and durability of response, and the regulator may require confirmatory data for the approval to remain in place.</p>
<p>The likelihood of that happening has decreased in recent months, with the agency beginning to toughen its stance on early approvals.</p>
<p>Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) is one of a number of drugmakers to voluntarily withdraw a product within an indication for which this type of approval was granted, namely Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a later-line option in small cell lung cancer (SCLC).</p>
<p>At the time, Merck referred in a statement to an ""industry-wide evaluation"" from the US FDA, looking at such approvals which have not subsequently met post-marketing requirements.</p>
<p>GSK has also received a positive opinion for Jemperli from the scientific body advising the European regulator, making a conditional marketing authorization there likely.</p>","2021-04-23 10:29:00",,"Jemperli, checkpoint, blocker, cancer, approved, approval, endometrial, developed, treatment, targets, FDA-approved, Administration, Drug, drugmaker, Food","The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly), a checkpoint blocker developed by UK drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-23 10:10:57","2021-04-23 10:32:03",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gsk-targets-endometrial-cancer-with-fda-approved-checkpoint-blocker,,,,,,glaxo_gsk_glaxosmithkline_big.jpg,glaxo_gsk_glaxosmithkline_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA","UK, USA","AnaptysBio, GlaxoSmithKline",Jemperli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Vazkepa is cleared as a treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in high cardiovascular risk statin-treated adult patients who have elevated triglycerides (&ge;150&nbsp;mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor.</p>
<p>The MHRA&rsquo;s license swiftly follows the European Medicine Agency advisory committee, CHMP, recommending authorization for icosapent ethyl on March 30, 2021. Approved to reduce triglycerides since 2012, icosapent ethyl, under the trade name Vascepa, was cleared in the USA as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in late 2019.</p>
<p>Amarin&rsquo;s understanding is that icosapent ethyl is among the first products to be submitted and licensed through the MHRA&rsquo;s new &lsquo;reliance&rsquo; route following the end of the Brexit transition period. Icosapent ethyl has been identified as a new active substance with likely multi-factorial mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action contributing to reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl are not completely understood.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing </strong></h2>
<p>Marketing authorization of icosapent ethyl, a fish oil-based agent, comes after a decade of designing and conducting evidence-based cardiovascular clinical outcomes research. In the landmark international, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven REDUCE-IT study in 8,179 statin-treated adult patients with moderately elevated triglyceride levels, were followed for a median duration of 4.9 years.</p>
<p>Amarin&rsquo;s president and chief executive John Thero commented: &ldquo;We began developing icosapent ethyl in Europe more than a decade ago. We are very grateful to the many patients and physicians who contributed to the development and clinical study of icosapent ethyl. Icosapent ethyl can help to reduce strokes, heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients across Europe. We are dedicated to a rethinking of cardiovascular disease risk reduction in Europe with an emphasis on preventative care. We will work tirelessly throughout Europe to make icosapent ethyl available to all patients who may benefit from this therapy.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-23 00:00:00","MHRA green lights new treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular e","Amarin Corp, Vazkepa.

488428,,"CPhI: COVID-19 driving manufacturing and CDMOs driving growth","Ahead of CPhI Discover (May 17-28, 2021) – global pharma’s largest virtual gathering – the CPhI executive post-pandemic pharma survey predicts that pandemic supply chain issues have further cemented a push for repatriated manufacturing globally.","<p>Ahead of <a href=""https://www.cphi.com/discover/en/home.html"">CPhI Discover</a> (May 17-28, 2021) &ndash; global pharma&rsquo;s largest virtual gathering &ndash; the CPhI executive post-pandemic pharma survey predicts that pandemic supply chain issues have further cemented a push for repatriated manufacturing globally. The findings suggest that over the next five years, governments and companies will gradually look to reduce complexity and increase regional self-reliance.</p>
<p>Highlighting this issue&rsquo;s current prominence, the implications of this shift are to be fully explored by a panel of experts during a live session (May 20 CPhI Discover). In particular, the merits of offshore versus onshore manufacturing, and/or if reshoring represents a rethinking of innovation approaches &ndash; with new manufacturing technologies introduced to improve efficiency. The recent launch of a new type of CDMO with &lsquo;powerful new technologies&rsquo; to meet post-pandemic vaccination needs is potentially an early indicator of the changing landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, some 500+ executives in the survey were extremely bullish in their outlook for pharma manufacturing both in the medium and longer term. In fact, more than 60% of executives anticipate COVID-19 will &lsquo;greatly improve the business outlook in 2021 and beyond&rsquo; &ndash; driven by expanding global demand for the existing COVID treatments and upscaling. Consequently, the contract services industry is predicted to grow even faster to meet demand.</p>
<h2><strong>Global reliance on Asian suppliers</strong></h2>
<p>Another issue the pandemic magnified was the global reliance on sourcing starting materials from suppliers in Asia, where 80% of materials are sourced from. However, the market is broadly ambivalent, with almost half of the respondents now stating it is realistic to &lsquo;localize the manufacture of starting materials&rsquo;, verses more than a third that suggest that any potential mass move would be &lsquo;too disruptive to a complex industry&rsquo;, while a further 15% believe it would be &lsquo;desirable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The industry is also seeing an expansion and modernization of finished dose manufacturing, with &lsquo;filling and packaging systems&rsquo; (24%) voted as the machinery type that pharma manufacturers will invest in the most in 2021. This is driven by drug product CMOs/CDMOs investing to become one-stop shops so they can aid innovators in simplifying and streamlining outsourcing, as well as the huge logistical challenge of filling billions of COVID-19 vaccines.

488423,,"Latin American countries fight antimicrobial resistance","Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay are the seven Latin American countries selected to receive support from the European Union (EU) to strengthen their action plans for the control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).","<p>Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay are the seven Latin American countries selected to receive support from the European Union (EU) to strengthen their action plans for the control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>
<p>The EU is the donor of the Working Together to Combat AMR tripartite project run in partnership by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).</p>
<p>This project has been launched in recognition of the threat of AMR in jeopardizing food security, economic development and the ability to fight many diseases. It is seen as a global public health problem that could lead to 10 million deaths over the next 25 years and cause economic losses of more than $100 trillion by 2050.</p>
<p>The PAHO has further pointed out that AMR is making it harder to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Gina Tambini, the PAHO/WHO Colombia representative, said: &ldquo;This is a great global challenge and hence the importance of working together; because this is a cross-border problem that affects human health, animal and environmental health. Knowledge and training in the proper use of antibiotics has never been more important than now.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Education and appropriate prescribing</h2>
<p>AMR is an issue that concerns the pharmaceutical industry and requires action on different fronts, according to Alvaro Orlando Sarmiento Castro, scientific director of the Association of Pharmaceutical Research and Development Laboratories (AFIDRO).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first objective is to educate and promote preventive measures, to avoid bacterial infections as much as possible. If we avoid infections, we avoid the need to use antibiotics and consequently the possibility of developing AMR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A second tranche of work is directed by different pharmaceutical companies, which market their products with the clear and explicit recommendation that they should be supplied to patients by strict prescription, issued by an officially authorized prescriber; in accordance with local legislation and with the same warning, they are authorized by the health authority &ndash; in the case of Colombia, this is INVIMA (National Institute of Drug and Food Surveillance).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some companies help with education around AMR, focusing on its importance and how to combat it. For example, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has run the Small Actions Will Save Millions of Lives campaign in Colombia to encourage and raise awareness about the correct use of antibiotics.</p>
<p>Similarly, AFIDRO laboratories provide prescribers with messages about the importance of using antibiotics in the indicated bacterial infection, at the indicated doses and with the prescribed duration of treatment, and invite them to report any resistance to this that they detect in their patients.</p>
<p>Finally, the pharmaceutical industry in Colombia, together with other entities, participates in programs for the proper final disposal of pharmaceutical products or their remnants, in such a way as to avoid reuse, dispensing, improper use or contamination of water sources.</p>
<h2>What about new antibiotics?</h2>
<p>Effective new antibiotics are needed to prevent medical procedures such as organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy, diabetes control and major surgery such as caesarean sections or hip replacements, from becoming very risky. Infections such as pneumonia, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are increasingly difficult to treat due to AMR and a lack of new antibiotics.</p>
<p>One of the issues of concern to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the face of AMR, is the reduction in private investment and the lack of innovation in the development of new antibiotics. The WHO states that, &ldquo;of the 60 drugs in development (50 antibiotics and 10 biological), few are specifically designed to fight the most threatening resistant bacteria (gram-negative bacteria).&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dr Orlando Sarmiento Castro stressed that the pharmaceutical industry does accept its responsibility and maintain ongoing interest in seeking therapeutic solutions for diseases that concern humanity, and it does not cease investigating new molecules to attack the different bacteria that generate resistance.</p>
<p>He added that today&rsquo;s research faces the challenge of identifying and understanding the resistance mechanisms that bacteria have developed in order to create new therapeutic options that can overcome these barriers and help infected patients.</p>

<p>Anavo&rsquo;s mission is to pioneer systematic drug discovery and development approaches aimed at phosphatases, a rich and largely untapped therapeutic target class.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to advance a proprietary drug discovery portfolio in oncology and establish a versatile and robust platform to address the target space broadly across multiple indications.</p>
<p>Anavo&rsquo;s leadership team, Dr Birgit Zech and Dr Gerhard M&uuml;ller, are building on several years of joint experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and have demonstrated the ability to navigate rapidly emerging sectors in biopharma most recently as co-founders of Gotham Therapeutics. The founding team is further complemented by Claus Schalper, a renowned finance expert and serial biotech entrepreneur.</p>
<h2><strong>Progress around SHP2</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Anavo was founded to unlock the full potential of phosphatase-targeting allosteric modulators and has attracted one of the largest European biotech seed rounds to date. Recent progress especially around SHP2 [srchomology-2-domain-containing PTP 2] has demonstrated that the time is ripe to address phosphatase drug discovery more systematically and on a much larger scale,&rdquo; said Dr Zech, chief executive of Anavo Therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While more than 60 kinase inhibitors have been approved in the USA, there are no commercial drugs that target phosphatases. &ldquo;We are trying to change that,&rdquo; said Dr Zech.</p>
<p>Dr M&uuml;ller, Anavo&rsquo;s chief scientific officer, noted that past attempts to target binding sites on phosphatases led to charged compounds that made poor drugs since they didn&rsquo;t get into cells easily and bound to their targets in unspecific ways. &ldquo;The entire industry dropped the field 20 years ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>","2021-04-22 12:04:00","Anavo Therapeutics launches with 20 million euros seed financing","Anavo Therapeutics, Established, Seed financing, Phosphate biology, SHP2","Anavo Therapeutics launches with 20 million euros seed financing",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-22 12:03:33","2021-04-22 12:10:38",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/anavo-therapeutics-launches-with-20-million-euros-seed-financing,,,,,,anavo_big.jpg,anavo_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Companies, mergers and acquisitions, One to Watch Companies, Research",Netherlands,"Anavo Therapeutics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The appreciation of the Swiss franc against many currencies had a negative impact on the results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates, said Roche, which does not release first-quarter earnings figures.</p>
<p>Sales in the <strong>Pharmaceuticals Division</strong> decreased 9% to 10.6 billion francs, mainly because of the continued biosimilars competition and the COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, the first quarter of 2021 was particularly challenging due to base effects, as the pandemic only started to have a significant business impact at Roche as of April 2020.</p>
<p>The <strong>Diagnostics Division</strong> reported very strong sales growth of 55% to 4.3 billion francs, mainly due to Roche&rsquo;s comprehensive and growing portfolio of COVID-19 tests. The Point of Care and Molecular Lab businesses made the largest contributions (+281% and +86%, respectively) with COVID-19 testing.</p>
<h2><strong>Product performances</strong></h2>
<p>On the positive side, the pharma business was lifted by rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra (tocilizumab), repurposed for COVID-19 pneumonia, revenues from which rose 22% to 779 million francs, as well as an anti-COVID-19 antibody cocktail -a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab - it has partnered on with Regeneron (Nasdaq: REGN) that reaped sales 166 million francs.</p>
<p>Negative performance due to biosimilars was seen for breast cancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab), with sales down 35% at 755 million francs, and MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab), for forms of blood cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and certain types of vasculitis, which fell 46% to 705 million.</p>
<p>The new medicines (launched since 2012) grew by 20% (or +880 million francs) and generated sales of 5.2 billion francs. Overall, demand continued to grow encouragingly, though here too the impact of the lower number of doctor&rsquo;s visits was clearly noticeable, said Roche.</p>
<p>Among the recently-launched drugs, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), for relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (first approved in 2017), generated first-quarter sales 1.2 billion francs (+16%);</p>
<p>Perjeta (pertuzumab), for HER2-positive breast cancer (first approved in 2012), reported revenues of 988 million francs (+2%);</p>
<p>Tecentriq (atezolizumab), for various types of cancer (first approved in 2016), sales were 775 million francs (+26%);</p>
<p>Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh), for hemophilia A, (first approved in 2017), posted revenues of 661 million francs (+33%).</p>
<h2><strong>Outlook for 2021 confirmed</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the continued strong impact of biosimilars, sales are expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digit range, at constant exchange rates. Core earnings per share are targeted to grow broadly in line with sales, at constant exchange rates. Roche expects to increase its dividend in Swiss francs further.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Group&rsquo;s performance in the first quarter, Roche chief executive Severin Schwan said: &ldquo;In 2021, Roche remains strongly committed to the fight against COVID-19. The uptake of our recently introduced diagnostic tests and medicines remains strong, while we continue to see the expected impact from biosimilars on sales of our established medicines. Our broad product pipeline keeps making good progress. I am particularly pleased about the highly encouraging study results of our immunotherapy Tecentriq [atezolizumab] in early lung cancer and of faricimab in ophthalmology. The upcoming acquisition of GenMark underlines our commitment to help control infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Based on the results of the first quarter of 2021, we confirm the outlook for the full year.&rdquo;</p>

488408,,"Generating the right evidence to support your brand’s value story - does your team have all the pieces of the puzzle?","Nicola Mahy, director at Align Strategy, makes the case for an integrated evidence plan to maximize patient access to a brand in an Expert View piece.","<p><em>Nicola Mahy, director at Align Strategy, makes the case for an integrated evidence plan to maximize patient access to a brand in an Expert View piece.</em></p>
<p>Launching a product is a major milestone for any brand. However, the data set supporting regulatory approval and reimbursement cannot be relied upon to maximize success across the lifecycle, especially as market dynamics evolve.</p>
<p>Importantly, additional evidence can be delivered on a continuous basis through post-marketing studies, additional clinical trials, and real-world evidence (RWE) studies; however, this is often generated piecemeal by different functional or local teams and is not effectively tracked in a coordinated fashion. Further data coming in from various local registries and investigator-initiated research programs (IIRs) adds an additional layer of evidence to track and consider.</p>
<p>The resulting situation is like holding an assortment of jigsaw pieces without a clear idea of what the finished puzzle is meant to look like. How can we be sure that we have a complete set of pieces? And are the pieces we have even part of the same jigsaw puzzle?</p>
<p>An integrated evidence plan is key to completing the puzzle &ndash; creating a view of what our desired holistic evidence &lsquo;picture&rsquo; looks like and identifying the full set of coordinated pieces needed to build it.</p>
<h2>What is an integrated evidence plan?</h2>
<p>An integrated evidence plan is designed to maximize patient access to your brand through changing competitive dynamics and shifting stakeholder needs by delivering the evidence needed to optimize value differentiation.</p>
<p>The plan bridges from clinical development to lifecycle management (LCM), connecting evidence generation into longer-term strategy planning across the lifecycle and bringing the right evidence to the right stakeholders at the right time. Delivering an integrated evidence plan requires a strategic approach coordinating activities over time and across geographies, encompassing:</p>
<p> Optimally designed and executed pivotal studies &ndash; right choice of endpoints/outcomes, comparators, measure of QoL impact/patient-centric outcomes, balance of subgroups.</p>
<p> Cost effectiveness evaluation, and budget impact and resource use modelling.</p>
<p> Post-launch RWE and generation of additional clinical data supportive of mid- to long-term strategy.</p>
<p> Balancing of global strategy with anticipation of potentially diverse evidence requirements that might exist across regions/countries.</p>
<h2>How can we achieve a coordinated integrated evidence plan?</h2>
<p>Holistic evidence generation planning requires development of a strategic understanding of evidence priorities over time. This process can be initiated and re-evaluated at any point across the lifecycle of a brand, from Phase III through to late lifecycle. The starting point is the identification of five-year value demonstration goals &ndash; ie, what do we want to be able to demonstrate or communicate about our brand over time in order to optimize the value story? These goals should be aligned with the current brand strategy framework and should encompass the needs of key stakeholders at global, regional, and local levels.</p>
<p>Building a view of existing and anticipated evidence and mapping this to value demonstration goals over time supports identification of priority evidence gaps that should be the basis of the integrated evidence plan. It might also be necessary to take a franchise view to coordinate investment across multiple assets.</p>
<p>Medical affairs, clinical development and P&amp;MA are all critical stakeholders, and a joint approach to workstream leadership is key. This is an area of activity that needs full participation and consideration from a truly cross-functional team, from R&amp;D through regulatory, commercial, to CI, biostatistics and publications.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of effective integrated evidence planning and what happens if this is not done appropriately?</h2>
<p>Continued evidence delivery is critical to ensuring a brand continues to best compete, to maintain impactful value differentiation for stakeholders that translates into clinically meaningful benefits for patients in the real world.</p>
<p>A coordinated and holistic evidence generation strategy makes sure all opportunities are leveraged and avoids evidence gaps not being anticipated early enough to be successfully addressed, and preventing a need to seek to &lsquo;retrofit&rsquo; data to address these challenges. Effective evidence generation planning also enables optimization of resources, avoiding duplication of activities or dissemination of incomplete, conflicting, or disjointed messages.</p>
<p>The integrated evidence plan should be a living document, revisited regularly to integrate changes in market dynamics or internal datasets, and to apply key insights and learnings. This is a workstream that sits alongside and complements annual brand planning in supporting<br />achievement of a brand&rsquo;s strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Through this workstream, a brand or franchise team can ensure that the evidence generation jigsaw puzzle comes together effectively to create a narrative that clearly demonstrates a brand&rsquo;s value story, with no missing or ill-fitting pieces distorting the picture.</p>","2021-04-21 12:15:00",,"evidence, plan, integrated, brand, strategy, pieces, puzzle, view, maximize, lifecycle, generation, access, patient, time, additional, planning, data, stor","Nicola Mahy, director at Align Strategy, makes the case for an integrated evidence plan to maximize patient access to a brand in an Expert View piece.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-20 17:00:32","2021-04-21 12:47:52",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/generating-the-right-evidence-to-support-your-brand-s-value-story-does-your-team-have-all-the-pieces-of-the-puzzle,,,,,,nicola_mahy_large.jpg,nicola_mahy_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Expert View, In Depth, Markets & Marketing, Product Launch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>&nbsp;The deal concerns the development, manufacture and commercialization of CTX001, an investigational CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy that is being developed as a potentially curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).</p>
<p>With this revised agreement, Vertex will deploy the breadth of its established global capabilities and proven experience in manufacturing, development, regulatory, and commercialization to maximize the potential for CTX001 to transform the lives of tens of thousands of patients in the USA, Europe and other countries. CRISPR Therapeutics will continue to support the development of CTX001 and invest in further innovation to maximize its potential.</p>
<h2><strong>Terms of the new accord include $900 million upfront</strong></h2>
<p>Under the terms of the amended agreement, Vertex will lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CTX001 with support from CRISPR Therapeutics. Vertex will be responsible for 60% of program costs and will receive 60% of profits from future sales of CTX001 worldwide, representing a 10% increase in program economics compared to the previous agreement. CRISPR will be responsible for 40% of costs and will receive 40% of profits. Additionally, CRISPR will receive a $900 million upfront payment, with potential for a $200 million payment upon the first regulatory approval of CTX001.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cell and genetic therapies are key to our strategy of developing transformative therapies for serious diseases, and this agreement is an important next step in cementing our leadership in these modalities as we bring forward our broad gene and cell-based therapeutics portfolio. As we take the lead on CTX001, we want to acknowledge the foundational contributions by the team at CRISPR Therapeutics,&rdquo; said Dr Jeffrey Leiden, executive chairman of Vertex.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Our increased investment in our partnership with CRISPR is based on the compelling clinical profile of CTX001, which shows its potential to be a durable cure for patients with SCD and TDT, and the rapid progress that we and our partners at CRISPR have made toward registration and commercialization. We see a significant commercial opportunity for CTX001, and we believe we will be able to further enhance that opportunity by fully leveraging the breadth of Vertex&rsquo;s capabilities &ndash; including our established and proven R&amp;D and commercialization expertise in serious diseases &ndash; to bring CTX001 to more patients around the world, more quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samarth Kulkarni, chief executive of CRISPR Therapeutics, noted: &ldquo;Given the transformative results and momentum that we have generated with this program, we are adopting a new operating model to enable a globally coordinated launch of CTX001, leveraging Vertex&rsquo;s best-in-class global capabilities and leadership in development, manufacturing, and commercialization to enable this medicine to reach all patients that can benefit from it as quickly as possible.

488409,,"bluebird bio updates on genetic disease portfolio","bluebird bio today announced business and program updates across its severe genetic disease portfolio, which pushed the US biotech firm’s shares down more than 2% to $27.40 by late-morning trading.","<p>bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE) today announced business and program updates across its severe genetic disease portfolio, which pushed the US biotech firm&rsquo;s shares down more than 2% to $27.40 by late-morning trading.</p>
<p>This included a revised diagnosis for the previously reported case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in its Phase I/II study of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (SCD) (bb1111), the company&rsquo;s decision to withdraw Zynteglo (betibeglogene autotemcel, beti-cel) for transfusion-dependent &beta;-thalassemia (TDT) from the German market, and a targeted reshaping of its workforce intended to enable the company to advance its late-stage gene therapy programs.</p>
<p>Last month, the company reported that it is very unlikely the suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reported in the HGB-206 study of LentiGlobin for SCD was related to the BB305 lentiviral vector (LVV). This assessment, along with the re-classification of the originally reported MDS case to transfusion-dependent anemia are important steps in bluebird bio&rsquo;s path to seeking removal of the clinical hold on studies HGB-206 and HGB-210 of LentiGlobin for SCD.</p>
<p>bluebird bio continues to work with regulators to resume its clinical studies in sickle cell disease as well as to remove the clinical hold for HGB-207 and HGB-212 clinical studies of beti-cel for &beta;-thalassemia, with potential lift of all clinical holds in mid-2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Failed price negotiations for Zynteglo in Germany</strong></h2>
<p>In Europe, reimbursement negotiations in Germany did not result in a price for Zynteglo that reflects the value of this one-time gene therapy with potential life-long benefit for people living with TDT. The price proposed by the German health authorities fails to recognize the severe burden of living with TDT or the innovation and benefit Zynteglo brings to patients who are impacted every day, throughout their lives by this severe genetic disease.</p>
<p>bluebird bio said it continues with productive negotiations across countries in Europe and plans to continue to provide updates on the negotiation processes in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) renewed the CMA for beti-cel. The CMA for beti-cel is valid in the 27 member states of the EU as well as the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration granted beti-cel Orphan Drug status and Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of TDT. Beti-cel is not approved in the USA. Beti-cel continues to be evaluated in the ongoing Phase III Northstar-2 (HGB-207) and Northstar-3 (HGB-212) studies.</p>
<p>In response to these and other events and shifts related to the business over the past year, bluebird bio plans to reduce and reshape its workforce, primarily in Europe. This reduction and reallocation of resources will allow the company to focus on priority European markets and streamline global operations going forward to ensure its ability to deliver gene therapies to patients based on bluebird bio&rsquo;s current business plans.</p>","2021-04-20 17:09:00","bluebird bio updates on genetic disease portfolio","bluebird bio, Genetic disease, Portfolio, LentiGlobin, Zynteglo, Sickle cell disease, Beta-thalassemia","bluebird bio updates on genetic disease portfolio",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-20 17:07:54","2021-04-20 17:17:53",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bluebird-bio-updates-on-genetic-disease-portfolio,,,,,,bluebird_bio_large.jpg,bluebird_bio_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Cell and Gene Therapy","Focus On, Management, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Regulation, Research","Germany, USA","bluebird bio","LentiGlobin, Zynteglo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The PRAC also concluded that these events should be listed as very rare side effects of the vaccine.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""The overall benefits of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects""</span>The committee took into account what it said was all currently available evidence including eight reports from the USA of serious cases of unusual blood clots associated with low levels of blood platelets, one of which had a fatal outcome, out of more than seven million Americans that have so far received Janssen&rsquo;s vaccine.</p>
<p>All cases occurred in people under 60 years of age within three weeks of being given the vaccination, the majority in women. Based on the currently available evidence, specific risk factors have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>The PRAC noted that the blood clots occurred mostly at unusual sites such as in veins in the brain, abdomen and arteries, together with low levels of blood platelets and sometimes bleeding.</p>
<p>The cases reviewed were very similar to the cases that occurred with the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Vaxzevria, according to the committee.</p>
<p>An EMA statement added: &ldquo;COVID-19 is associated with a risk of hospitalization and death. The reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.</p>

The data are consistent with findings from the first Phase III clinical trial, BRAVE-AA2, top-lined earlier this year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the companies announced disappointed results of COV-BARRIER, a Phase III study evaluating baricitinib 4mg once daily plus standard of care (SoC) versus placebo plus SoC for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Approved under the trade name Olumiant, baricitinib is primarily a rheumatoid arthritis therapy.</p>
<p>In both investigational alopecia trials, a statistically-significant proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieved the primary endpoint of hair regrowth across the two dosing regimens at Week 36 compared to patients treated with placebo. AA is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that can progress, and currently has no therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Pressing need for approved treatment options&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>""There is a pressing need for approved treatment options for people suffering from alopecia areata as existing topicals and steroids do not provide meaningful improvement for many patients,"" said Dr Maryanne Senna, dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School and clinical trial investigator of BRAVE-AA1. ""I am pleased to see such positive results from these important trials of baricitinib offering a much-needed potential breakthrough treatment option for this disease.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BRAVE-AA trial program was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in adult patients with severe AA. The program consists of two trials: BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2. BRAVE-AA1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive Phase II/III trial. Based on interim results of the Phase 2 portion of BRAVE-AA1 at Week 12, baricitinib 2mg and 4mg once-daily doses were selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 portion of the study.</p>","2021-04-20 16:21:00","Baricitinib improved hair regrowth for alopecia patients in Phase III","Incyte, Eli Lilly, Baricitinib, Phase III, BRAVE-AA1, Alopecia areata","Baricitinib improved hair regrowth for alopecia patients in Phase III study",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-20 16:20:59","2021-04-20 16:28:01",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/baricitinib-improved-hair-regrowth-for-alopecia-patients-in-phase-iii-study,,,,,,lilly-incyte-big.png,lilly-incyte-small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Hair diseases",Biotechnology,"Autoimmune Disorders, Dermatologicals","Drug Trial, Research",USA,"Eli Lilly, Incyte",baricitinib,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Submitted by Japanese pharma Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503) and US firm Seagen (Nasdaq: SGEN), the applications were granted Priority Review, with a target action date of August 17, 2021. The review of both applications will also be conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.</p>
<p>The FDA&rsquo;s RTOR program aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international partners.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The first sBLA is based on the Phase III EV-301 trial and seeks to convert PADCEV&rsquo;s accelerated approval to regular approval. The second sBLA, based on the pivotal trial EV-201&rsquo;s cohort 2, requests an expansion of the current indication to include patients with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and are ineligible for cisplatin. Results from EV-301 were published in the <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035807""><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></a>. Results from EV-301 and EV-201 cohort 2 were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our recent regulatory submissions, we intend to provide the highest level of clinical evidence supporting Padcev use &ndash; overall survival data from a randomized Phase III trial &ndash; and expand availability in multiple countries where there is unmet medical need,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Krivoshik, senior vice president and oncology therapeutic area head, Astellas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These FDA filings, along with regulatory submissions outside of the United States under our collaboration with Astellas, are important steps in our shared goal of bringing Padecev to more patients with advanced urothelial cancer,&rdquo; added Dr Roger Dansey, chief medical officer of Seagen.</p>
<p>Health authorities in Australia and Canada will evaluate data from EV-301 and EV-201 for initial registrations under the Project Orbis scheme. Last month, Astellas filed for Japanese approval of Padcev.</p>
<h2><strong>Market prospects</strong></h2>
<p>The bladder cancer therapeutics market was valued at $670 million in 2018 across the seven major markets (7MM: USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan) and is expected to grow exponentially at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6% - accruing slightly less than $5.6 billion in 2028, according to analytics firm GlobalData.</p>
<p>Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData believe that therapies such as Padcev, and its combination with Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab), sacituzumab govitecan, and bempegaldesleukin in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo (nivolumab), carry tremendous potential to benefit muscle invasive, locally-advanced and metastatic bladder cancer patients.</p>","2021-04-20 15:43:00","FDA accepts two priority review sBLAs for Padcev","Astellas, Seagen, Padcev, sBLA, Priority review, Regular approval, Cancer, Urothelial, Bladder","FDA accepts two priority review sBLAs for Padcev",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-20 15:42:22","2021-04-20 15:50:18",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-two-priority-review-sblas-for-padcev,,,,,,seagen_large.jpg,seagen_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Focus On, Regulation, US FDA","Japan, USA","Astellas, Seagen",Padcev,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The results were presented Monday in an oral session at the 2021 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Virtual Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>The nine-month results achieved the study&rsquo;s primary endpoint, with vutrisiran showing improvement in the mean change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score (mNIS+7) as compared to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase III study of patisiran. At nine months vutrisiran also met all secondary endpoints, demonstrating improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) instrument and improvement in gait speed as assessed by the timed 10-meter walk test (10-MWT), both compared to the external placebo group. The majority of patients experienced improvement in neuropathy and in quality of life, both relative to baseline, showing the potential for vutrisiran to reverse polyneuropathy manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis. Vutrisiran also demonstrated an encouraging safety profile with no drug-related discontinuations or deaths.</p>
<p>Based on these positive data, Alnylam has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with the US Food and Drug Administration requesting approval of vutrisiran for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults.</p>
<h2><strong>Market prospects</strong></h2>
<p>The transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) market is expected to grow from $585 million in 2019 to $14.1 billion in 2029 across the seven major markets, according to GlobalData. This would put the market on course for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.5%.</p>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) therapies that aim to block production of TTR at the source are expected to help grow the sector. GlobalData noted that this new mechanism is giving Alnylam&rsquo;s Onpattro (patisiran) a huge boost in market share and the trend is set to continue for its second drug vutrisiran, and Akcea's (Nasdaq: AKCA) Tegsedi (inotersen) and AKCEA- TTR-LRx, all of which will compete for market share within the RNAi class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The HELIOS-A study results demonstrate that vutrisiran improves neuropathy, quality of life and gait speed as soon as 9 months &ndash; compared to the external placebo arm of APOLLO &ndash; in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, with an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. The reversal of polyneuropathy manifestations of disease demonstrated in patients treated with vutrisiran in the study, the encouraging safety profile, and the totality of data from the trial, reinforce our belief in the promise of our RNAi therapeutics&rsquo; mechanism of action, as first established with Onpattro (patisiran). Further, we are encouraged by the exploratory endpoint results showing the impact of vutrisiran on NT-proBNP, a marker of cardiac stress, and look forward to additional data on exploratory cardiac endpoints at the 18-month readout, expected in late 2021,&rdquo; said Dr Akshay Vaishnaw, president of R&amp;D at Alnylam.</p>","2021-04-20 11:54:00","HELIOS-A Phase III study of vutrisiran meets goals","Alnylam Pharma, Vutrisiran, Phase III, HELIOS-A, hATTR, Amyloidosis, Onpattro","HELIOS-A Phase III study of vutrisiran meets goals",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-20 11:52:49","2021-04-20 12:01:48",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/helios-a-phase-iii-study-of-vutrisiran-meets-goals,,,,,,alnylam_big.png,alnylam_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,Polyneuropathy,Biotechnology,"Rare diseases","AAN, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research",USA,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals","Onpattro, vutrisiran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>These will constitute a large proportion of prescriptions as they will be used as monotherapy or in combinations through all stages and lines of therapy for HCC, a leading cause of liver cancer, says data and analytics company GlobalData.</p>
<p>Class-wide sales <span style=""background-color: #d5d5d5;"">o</span>f I-O are expected to grow to 72.2% of the market, contributing $3.8 billion to global sales in 2029 and growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28%.</p>
<p>Kinase inhibitors, such as Bayer's (BAYN: DE) Nexavar (sorafenib) and Eisai's (TYO: 4523) Lenvima (lenvatinib), have dominated the HCC market for more than a decade and were the standard of care (SOC) in first-line advanced HCC until recently.</p>
<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s forecast shows this class of drugs capturing 65.9% or $679.6 million of the total market sales in 2019, followed by immunotherapy at 31.5% or $324.9 million, and angiogenesis inhibitors at 2.5% or $26.2 million.</p>
<h2><strong>Newer entrant</strong></h2>
<p>In 2020, Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab), an angiogenesis inhibitor, plus the Swiss giant&rsquo;s Tecentriq (atezolizumab), an I-O therapy, a first-in-class combination approved for first-line advanced HCC, was approved in the eight major markets (8MM: the USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan, and China).</p>
<p>The combination showed better safety and efficacy compared to kinase inhibitors and immediately replaced the SOC. GlobalData anticipates that the combination will remain the market leader by sales through 2029. Combined sales of these drugs are expected to be $1.9 billion, including biosimilar sales, with $1.3 billion (68.4%) of those sales coming from the combination in the first-line advanced HCC setting, and the remainder from sales of those drugs in other combinations and other lines of therapy.</p>
<p>Mandana Emamzadeh, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Angiogenesis inhibitors&mdash;including Avastin, which will be found across all lines of therapy, and Lilly&rsquo;s Cyramza, in the second-line advanced setting, along with their biosimilars&mdash;are expected to grow to 18.2% of market share by sales. This class is forecast to contribute $965.7m to global sales in 2029 and represents the highest CAGR of 43.4% by 2029. While impressive growth is expected due to the fast uptake of Avastin + Tecentriq, and due to the additional label expansions for Avastin, this is in part due to the low base-year sales in 2019 when the drug was considered off-label for HCC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kinase inhibitors will mostly be the treatment of choice in second-line advanced HCC. In general, kinase inhibitors will see a downward trend in usage, resulting in a decline in market sales to 9.5% or $505.5 million and posting a negative CAGR of 2.9% by 2029.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-20 10:53:00","I-O will be dominant drug class for liver cancer by 2029, says analyst","Hepatocellular, Carcinoma, Cancer, Liver, Market, Bayer, Nexavar, Eisai, Lenvima, Roche, Avastin, GlobalData","I-O will be dominant drug class for liver cancer by 2029, says analyst",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-20 10:53:03","2021-04-20 11:01:40",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/i-o-will-be-dominant-drug-class-for-liver-cancer-by-2029-says-analyst,,,,,,globaldata.jpg,globaldatasmall.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Liver,Biotechnology,Immuno-oncology,"Markets & Marketing",,"Bayer, Eisai, GlobalData, Roche","Avastin, Lenvima, Nexavar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The Ministry of Health of Russia maintains a register of persons who have been vaccinated, as well as citizens who have been infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to the data from 3.8 million Russians vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020, to March 31, 2021, as part of the mass-scale civil vaccination program, the infection rate starting from the 35th day from the date of the first injection was only 0.027%.</p>

<p>The CARB-X award provides up to $5.3 million to support preclinical development of Phico&rsquo;s SASPject PT3.9 project, plus up to $12.86 million more if the program progresses successfully through safety to Phase I first-in-human clinical studies, subject to available funding.</p>
<p>Phico&rsquo;s SASPject technology is said to be ground-breaking in that it uses engineered bacterial viruses combined with antibacterial small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASPs) to precisely target the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria and inactivate the bacteria&rsquo;s DNA, stopping them from reproducing and spreading.</p>
<p>Additionally, SASPs are unaffected by the sequence of bacterial DNA, making it unlikely that bacteria could develop resistance, and are therefore effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the top three antibiotic-resistant bacteria listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as &lsquo;priority pathogens&rsquo; posing the greatest threat to human health.</p>
<p>Erin Duffy, R&amp;D chief of CARB-X, said: &ldquo;Phico&rsquo;s innovative approach delivers the antibiotic effect of SASPs by using engineered bacteriophages to precisely target Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This approach has the potential to target the bacteria without damaging other cells or contributing to the rise of resistance.

As the world grapples with vaccines short supply, Mr Poonawalla has flagged the US embargo on raw material exports.","<p>Serum Institute of India (SII) chief executive Adar Poonawalla has appealed to US President Joe Biden to lift the US embargo on exporting raw materials to help ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production. As the world grapples with vaccines short supply, Mr Poonawalla has flagged the US embargo on raw material exports.<br /> <br /> The SII is currently manufacturing the anti-coronavirus vaccine Covishield, developed by AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) and Oxford University. The SII has already delivered over 100 million doses to India and exported around 60 million doses to other countries.<br /> <br /> Tagging the Twitter handle of the US President, Mr Poonawalla wrote: ""Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the US, I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US so that vaccine production can ramp up.""<br /> <br /> Mr Poonawalla's tweet follows Oxford-AstraZeneca's legal notice to the Pune-based Serum Institute for delays in deliveries. The SII chief had earlier admitted that the Indian company has been facing problems in sending out the required batches of COVID-19 vaccines due to bureaucratic and government-related hurdles.<br /> <br /> The export embargoes prevent US vaccine makers from exporting shots globally.</p>
<h2><strong>Aimed to protect likes of Pfizer, J&amp;J and Moderna</strong></h2>
<p>The US action is meant to ensure local supplies for US vaccine makers like Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA). Covid-19 vaccine makers in India have been concerned that the use of the Defense Production Act by the USA to boost its own vaccine production was resulting in export curtailment of critical raw materials. This, the companies state, is hobbling vaccine production.<br /> <br /> The SII CEO&rsquo;s move has triggered a string of reactions on why raw materials could not be sourced locally. Covaxin-maker Bharat Biotech, too, is reportedly having issues with the adjuvant that is sourced from the USA. Covaxin is co-developed by the ICMR and Bharat Biotech.</p>","2021-04-19 13:57:00","India’s SII appeals to US President against ingredient export ban","Serum Institute of India, SII, Appeal, US President, Ingredients, Exports, COVID-19, Vaccines, Coveshield, AstraZeneca, Covaxin, Bharat Biotech","India’s SII appeals to US President against ingredient export ban",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-19 13:56:10","2021-04-19 14:05:07",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-s-sii-appeals-to-us-president-against-ingredient-export-ban,,,,,,india_flag_big.jpg,india_flag_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"COVID-19 vaccines",Generics,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Production","India, USA","AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India","Covaxin, Covishield",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>These data are being presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting, April 17-22.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biogen is humbled that we were pioneers in developing the first treatment for SMA, along with our collaboration partners Ionis Pharmaceuticals. We continue to be driven by the pursuit of better outcomes for patients, including exploring the potential of a higher dose of Spinraza in the DEVOTE study, in addition to initiating the RESPOND study,&rdquo; said Dr Alfred Sandrock Jr, head of R&amp;D at Biogen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also evaluating the use of biomarkers and digital tools to supplement traditional clinical assessments for SMA and enhance disease monitoring. Through these collective research efforts, we aim to provide valuable data that may help guide future treatment approaches and decisions for people with SMA,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Exploring opportunities to optimize treatment in SMA</strong></p>
<p>Building on the proven efficacy and well-established safety of Spinraza in a broad range of patients with SMA, the Phase II/III DEVOTE study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential for even greater efficacy of Spinraza when administered at a higher dose than currently approved. The three-part study includes an open-label safety evaluation cohort (Part A), a pivotal, double-blind, active control randomized treatment cohort (Part B) and an open-label cohort (Part C) transitioning from the approved 12-milligram (mg) dose of Spinraza to the higher dose.</p>
<p>Spinraza, which generated sales of $2.05 billion last year, is approved to treat infants, children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and is available in more than 50 countries. As a foundation of care in SMA, more than 11,000 individuals have been treated with Spinraza worldwide, Biogen noted.</p>

<p>The financing will support continued advancement of ADG20, Adagio&rsquo;s lead clinical candidate being developed as a single agent for both the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, as well potential future coronaviruses.</p>
<p>Existing investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, OrbiMed, Polaris Partners, Mithril, GV, Population Health Partners, Adimab and Omega Funds also participated in the financing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADG20 is distinguished from other antibody treatments targeting SARS-CoV-2 by virtue of its ability to effectively and durably neutralize a broad range of sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, with high potency. Pre-clinical data generated by Adagio and validated by the University of Oxford in a recent Cell manuscript, show that ADG20 uniquely combines potency, breadth and complete neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and all currently known variants of concern.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Phase I study initiated</strong></h2>
<p>Adagio has initiated a Phase I study of ADG20 in healthy volunteers and a pivotal Phase I/II/III clinical trial in high-risk individuals with mild or moderate COVID-19, the <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04805671?term=ADG20&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"">STAMP trial</a>. The trial is strategically designed to enable the rapid advancement of ADG20 to proof-of-concept data, which if positive, are intended to support an Emergency Use Authorization submission. In addition, the company is on track to initiate a third clinical trial in the second quarter of 2021, evaluating ADG20 for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a major health crisis worldwide, and even with emergency use authorizations for vaccines and antibody-based therapies, there remains a significant need for medications to treat and prevent COVID-19 infection. We are advancing ADG20 through a rapid development strategy based on pre-clinical data that demonstrate its best-in-class potential for treating all known variants of COVID-19 today,&rdquo; said Tillman Gerngross, co-founder and chief executive of Adagio.</p>","2021-04-19 12:23:00","Adagio Thera nabs $336 million financing to progress ADG20 antibody","Adagio Therapeutics, ADG20, Financing, Series C, Antibody, COVID-19, Prevention","Adagio Thera nabs $336 million financing to progress ADG20 antibody",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-19 12:22:46","2021-04-19 17:23:52",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/adagio-thera-nabs-336-million-financing-to-progress-adg20-antibody,,,,,,adagio_big.jpg,adagio_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases","Business Financing, Coronavirus, Focus On, Research",USA,"Adagio Therapeutics",ADG20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Ragweed is a common cause of seasonal, airborne allergy in North America and in certain parts of Europe, as well as international markets. Ragwitek was first launched for adult use in the USA and Canada in 2014 and was approved in nine European countries and Russia in late 2017. In addition, ALK recently received European and Canadian regulatory approval for pediatric use of the ragweed tablet.</p>
<p>ALK&rsquo;s executive vice president of R&amp;D, Henrik Jacobi, says: &ldquo;Ragweed is a major cause of allergy in North America. This expanded approval means there can now be an earlier intervention to treat what can be a distressing condition. It also advances ALK&rsquo;s commitment to address unmet medical need by expanding the coverage of its tablet portfolio to cover patients of all relevant ages.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The application for pediatric use drew upon clinical data from a Phase III safety and efficacy trial involving 1,022 patients aged five through 17 years with a history of ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis. The randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, comparative trial met its primary endpoint, with a major reduction in the average total combined score (TCS) during the peak ragweed season of 38%. Moreover, efficacy in children was consistent with that seen for its sister product, Grazax (Grastek in the USA) for grass pollen allergies.</p>

<p>This marks the second EC approval for French pharma major Sanofi&rsquo;s (Euronext: SAN) Sarclisa in combination with a standard of care regimen in less than 12 months. Sanofi shares were up 1.1% at 85.97 euros by late morning trading today.</p>
<p>This adds to the competition against Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) unit Janssen&rsquo;s multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab), which Sanofi hopes Sarclisa will outperform. Janssen has also been able to secure approval for a new subcutaneous formulation of Darzalex, dubbed <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-darzalex-fasbro"">Darzalex Faspro</a>, offering a much faster and easier mode of administration.</p>
<h2><strong>Sales forecasts</strong></h2>
<p>Analysts have suggested that peak sales of up to $1 billion could be realistic for Sarclisa, while Darzalex is already exceeding $4 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<p>Sanofi itself estimates the total third-line market opportunity in the USA and major European markets at $3.4 billion. The second-line market estimate is much larger, at $6 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As there is no cure for&nbsp;multiple myeloma and patients often&nbsp;experience disease relapse, we must persist in our pursuit for additional treatment options. Nearly 30% of patients treated with the Sarclisa regimen had a profound response with undetectable levels of multiple myeloma,&rdquo; said Dr Philippe Moreau, Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Nantes, France. &ldquo;This new therapeutic regimen has the potential to become&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard of care for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who now have another treatment option earlier in the progression of their disease,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Follows US approval in March</strong></h2>
<p>This EC approval closely follows the US Food and Drug Administration authorization of Sarclisa for a similar indication in March 2021. In June 2020, Sanofi announced Sarclisa received EC approval in combination with another standard of care regimen, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex),&nbsp;for the treatment of adult&nbsp;patients&nbsp;with relapsed and refractory MM who have received at least two prior therapies&nbsp;including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The EC approval of Sarclisa in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone means patients living with multiple myeloma in Europe can now receive Sarclisa&nbsp;in combination with two standard of care treatment regimens,&rdquo; said Peter Adamson, global development head, oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi, adding: &ldquo;The carfilzomib and dexamethasone combination&nbsp;represents an important&nbsp;standard of care in Europe. The Phase III IKEMA trial&rsquo;s finding that the addition of Sarclisa to this regimen reduced&nbsp;the risk of progression or death by nearly half formed the basis for this important EC approval.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Sarclisa efficacy and safety profile in difficult-to-treat patients</strong></h2>
<p>This approval is based on data from the Phase III IKEMA study, a randomized, multi-center, open label clinical trial that enrolled 302 patients with relapsed MM across 69 centers spanning 16 countries. The primary endpoint of IKEMA was progression free survival (PFS). While median PFS, defined as time to disease progression or death, for Kd was 19.15 months, the median PFS for patients receiving Sarclisa added to carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Sarclisa combination therapy; n=179) had not been reached at the time of the pre-planned interim analysis. Sarclisa combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% (hazard ratio 0.531, 99% CI 0.318-0.889, p=0.0007) versus standard of care Kd alone in patients with MM.</p>","2021-04-19 10:46:00","Second indication of Sarclisa for relapsed MM approved by EC","Sanofi, Sarclisa, Multiple myeloma, MM, Amgen, Kyprolis, European Commission, Approval","Second indication of Sarclisa for relapsed MM approved by EC",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-19 10:44:38","2021-04-19 10:56:10",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/second-indication-of-sarclisa-for-relapsed-mm-approved-by-ec,,,,,,2020_sanofi_big.jpg,2020_sanofi_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Multiple myeloma",Biotechnology,"Hematology, Oncology","European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation","Europe, France","Amgen, Janssen, Sanofi","Darzalex, Kyprolis, Sarclisa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In their opinion, this proposal could destabilize the market and provoke a shortage of drugs due to the restriction of competition. This is stated in a letter addressed to the Prime Minister of seven associations, including the Association of International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (AIPM), the Union of Professional Pharmaceutical Organizations (SPFO), the League of Patient Defenders, and the All-Russian Union of Patients.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical associations unite more than 60 companies, including Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Abbott (NYSE: ABT), AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Bayer (BAYN: DE), Servier, Merck (MRK: DE), Novartis (NOVN: VX), pharmacy chains - Neopharm, Rigla and others.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the essence of the sentence ""second extra""</strong></h2>
<p>The development of the so-called ""second extra"" proposal became known in March from the instructions of Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. The essence of the initiative is as follows: if a company from the EAEU countries enters the auction with a drug from the list of strategically significant ones, according to which the full cycle production is localized (from the synthesis of a molecule of a substance to mass production), then applications from other manufacturers that have such a production chain in within the framework of the union is not, rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As conceived by the ministry, the mechanism will not be applied if there are no applications from full cycle manufacturers or if a specific medicine is not produced on the territory of the EAEU. Now the initiative has not been accepted by the government, and the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Health are holding consultations in order to understand whether the entry into force of the decision to restrict the bidding will lead to a shortage of drugs.</p>
<p>The authors of the letter call the provision of such preferences as a ""second extra"" for manufacturers of pharmaceutical substances as the forced introduction of an anticompetitive mechanism in the interests of a group of drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>In addition, according to community representatives, the initiative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade will make the drug safety system in the country vulnerable due to the fact that small volumes of pharmaceutical substances will be unprofitable to produce. One of the consequences may be a shortage of drugs due to the fact that competition will be limited, which may even lead to the forced withdrawal of many manufacturers from the market, they say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country runs the risk of being left without certain drugs altogether if a full-cycle manufacturer cannot meet the need for the entire health care system,&rdquo; the appeal says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Alexander Semyonov, president of Active Component, a Russian manufacturer of active ingredients, said in an interview with the Russian RBC business paper, the project of preferences for state purchases concerns only the list of 215 strategically important drugs. Those foreign companies that are ready to localize the production of ingredients will receive the same preferences as Russian ones.</p>","2021-04-19 10:12:00","Russia’s AIPM et al warn of dangers of a “second extra”","Russia, Production, Competition, Shortages, Legislation","Russia’s AIPM et al warn of dangers of a “second extra”",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-19 09:13:39","2021-04-19 16:47:03",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-aipm-et-al-warn-of-dangers-of-a-second-extra,,,,,,aipm-png.PNG,aipm-png.PNG,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Pharmaceuticals policy",Pharmaceutical,"All therapy areas","Focus On, Government Affairs, Production, Russian market",Russia,"AIPM, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Amgen&rsquo;s main interest in Five Prime&rsquo;s pipeline was the lead, first-in-class anti-FGFR2b inhibitor bemarituzumab tested in gastric (GC) or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.</p>
<p>However, analytics company GlobalData&rsquo;s senior oncology and hematology analyst Sakis Palioras, that that, &ldquo;while having shown an improvement over chemotherapy in a Phase II trial, bemarituzumab is expected to play a niche role in the management of GC, even if it progresses to a registrational study and receives Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a separate news item on Friday, the FDA approved the first immunotherapy in this indication, Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-green-lights-first-immunotherapy-as-initial-gastric-cancer-therapy"">(nivolumab).</a></p>
<p>According to key opinion leaders interviewed by GlobalData, bemarituzumab is expected to provide benefit only in the small share of patients who have evidence of FGFR rearrangements or other mutations, and not in the 30% of GC patients that could potentially be eligible in theory.</p>
<h2><strong>Modest peak sales expected</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;GlobalData&rsquo;s patient-based forecast projects bemarituzumab&rsquo;s peak sales in GC to reach only $67 million in the eight leading markets (8MM; the USA, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the UK, Japan, and South Korea. However, expansion in multiple FGFR-affected indications, such as bladder cancer, is where the most upside resides, with a forecast $305m peak sales globally by 2027,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amgen is uniquely poised to take advantage of Five Prime&rsquo;s pre-clinical and early-stage clinical research, with significant experience in multiple mechanisms of action in oncology and taking first-in-class molecules to market. More likely, Amgen is considering several molecules from Five Prime&rsquo;s early-stage portfolio other than bemarituzumab, and with that information in mind, the premium paid to acquire Five Prime seems quite reasonable,&rdquo; Dr Palioras concluded.</p>","2021-04-19 10:11:00","Amgen’s bet on Five Prime needs more than one label for bemarituzumab","Amgen, Five Prime Therapeutics, Bemarituzumab, Acquisition, Completed, Cancer, Gastric, Gastroesophageal","Amgen’s bet on Five Prime needs more than one label for bemarituzumab to pay off, says analyst",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-18 13:49:36","2021-04-19 10:11:55",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amgen-s-bet-on-five-prime-needs-more-than-one-label-for-bemarituzumab-to-pay-off-says-analyst,,,,,,amgen_large.jpg,amgen_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Research",USA,"Amgen, Five Prime Therapeutics, GlobalData",bemarituzumab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

Editor</p>
<p>Among last week&rsquo;s notable news, Biogen and Sage Therapeutics presented new data on their essential tremor candidate SAGE-324, which raised questions on tolerability. Roche and Regeneron released Phase III data confirming the efficacy of their COVID-19 antibody cocktail &ndash; casirivimab and imdevimab &ndash; for the treatment of this infection. In another disappointment in the COVID-19 space, Merck &amp; Co said it is discontinuing development of MK-7110 as a treatment for hospitalized patients. In the latest investigation of thromboembolic events linked to novel coronavirus vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration has launched a review of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 candidate. On the deal making front, the UK&rsquo;s C4X Discovery signed an agreement with French pharma major Sanofi on an oral pre-clinical interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor program.</p>
<h2><strong>Sage&rsquo;s technical tremor win fails to move</strong></h2>
<p>When a disease has no available treatments for its underlying cause any clinical success is welcome. This holds true for essential tremor and for Sage/Biogen&rsquo;s Sage-324, whose <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sage-and-biogen-shares-dip-on-essential-tremor-drug-s-questionable-tolerability"">Phase II KINETIC study</a> just about cleared the efficacy bar in this disease, commented Jacob Plieth and Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>However, investors wondering whether Sage-324 is now de-risked are not celebrating just yet, and the stock crept down 2% that morning. Among the concerns are the win&rsquo;s narrow margin, a high rate of adverse events, and Sage&rsquo;s admission that, rather than going into Phase III, a new mid-stage study was now needed.</p>
<p>The biggest worries to emerge from KINETC are that 68% and 38% of patients on Sage-324 experienced somnolence and dizziness respectively, and though there were no falls, 15% had balance disorder. 38% of subjects on active treatment discontinued, while dosing had to be reduced in 62%.</p>
<p>Stifel analysts wrote that such levels of somnolence and dizziness were &ldquo;simply too high&rdquo; to differentiate Sage-324, a Gaba A modulator. In other diseases even a high rate of adverse events might not be disastrous, but essential tremor patients tend to be old and afflicted by comorbidities.</p>
<p>Mizuho&rsquo;s Vamil Divan noted Sage saw better results in the 47 patients with more severe tremor, where the P value was 0.007, &ldquo;suggesting the drug may have a more clear role in that population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both he and RBC&rsquo;s Brian Abrahams, though, agreed the drug&rsquo;s side effects could significantly impair its commercial viability. Mr Divan rated the readout a tick positive for Sage. Mr Abrahams argued it was a tick negative, but largely inconsequential for two companies facing bigger questions elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see a limited path forward for &lsquo;324 to show clinically meaningful effects with an acceptable benefit/risk profile in this relatively benign disease,&rdquo; he said while giving room for Sage to explore lower doses or target just severe populations. &ldquo;Both Sage and [Biogen] have far more major binary events this quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Positive REGEN-COV MAb results in prophylactic setting support expanded use</strong></h2>
<p>Last Monday, Regeneron and Roche announced positive results from two Phase III trials for <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-iii-data-confirm-potency-of-roche-coronavirus-treatment"">REGEN-COV antibody cocktail</a> in the prophylactic setting to reduce risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, not SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>Regeneron will share the data with the Food and Drug Administration and request Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) expansion to include use of the 1,200mg dose subcutaneous formulation in these settings, and he expects approval to be forthcoming in late second quarter. Given the limited supply of the antibodies, and the contracts already in place, he does not expect any upside in quarter two, but this positive result should deliver a higher tail of revenue in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and potentially also from Ex-US markets.</p>
<p>The 2069A trial assessed the ability of REGEN-COV to reduce the risk and burden of infection among household contacts of infected individuals while the 2069B trial assessed the ability of REGEN-COV to reduce the risk and burden of progressing to symptomatic disease among recently infected asymptomatic patients. Both Phase III trials evaluated one 1,200mg dose of REGEN-COV in the subcutaneous formulation administered in four 300mg injections versus placebo. The 2069A study found REGEN-COV provided 72% protection against symptomatic infections in the first week, 93% in subsequent weeks, and among those who developed symptomatic infections, REGEN-COV treatment led to faster virus clearance and shorter symptom duration.</p>
<p>The 2069B study found REGEN-COV reduced overall risk of progressing to symptomatic disease by 31%, 76% after the third day, and shortened symptom duration and reduced viral levels. Mr Porges believes the positive results from the prophylactic settings support expanded utilization of REGEN-COV and should further reinforce its position as a complement to vaccines since it also appears to be the most effective antibody cocktail against emerging immune-resistant variants. In the prophylactic setting, he will also be looking for results from 600mg subcutaneous formulation, which could improve utilization even further. Leerink currently estimates REGEN-COV revenue of $2.36 billion and $343 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively.</p>
<h2><strong>Merck&rsquo;s COVID-10 push narrows further</strong></h2>
<p>Merck &amp; Co had already bowed out of the COVID-19 vaccine arena. Now its efforts at developing a therapy for the virus have taken a step back too, noted Madeleine Armstrong and Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>The company said today that it was <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-to-discontinue-mk-7110-for-covid-19-development"">discontinuing development of MK-7110</a>, which it gained through its $425 million buyout of OncoImmune, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As for its second big hope, the oral antiviral molnupiravir, Merck has scrapped a trial in hospitalized patients; all expectations for the project now rest on a pivotal study in outpatients.</p>
<p>The antiviral pipeline for treating COVOD-19 thus now looks even sparser. And the developments are yet another example of how several big names in the vaccine and antiviral space have stumbled, while newcomers have capitalised on opportunities arising from the pandemic.</p>
<p>MK-7110 is also in development for other indications,&nbsp;<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04095858"">the most advanced being graft-versus-host disease</a>, so maybe Merck can still recoup some of the cash it has spent.</p>
<p>In any case, Merck&rsquo;s only COVID-19 hope is now molnupiravir, which is being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.</p>
<p>And this project&rsquo;s only shot is in outpatients. Merck today said it had decided to discontinue the Phase II/III MOVE-In study in hospitalized patients, after the Phase II portion had shown that molnupiravir was unlikely to show a benefit.</p>
<p>Maybe this is not surprising: many other agents have struggled to make an impact in this population, and it seems that most therapies need to be given early in the course of disease to have a chance of having an effect.</p>
<p>If antivirals are broadly ineffective in hospitalized Covid-19 patients this could be bad news for the likes of Roche and Pfizer, which both have inpatient trials of their agents ongoing, said Ms Armstrong and Mr Plieth.</p>
<h2><strong>FDA and CDC calling to halt distribution of J&amp;J vaccine deals blow to global effort</strong></h2>
<p>Following the news that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a joint statement calling for an <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cdc-and-fda-recommend-pausing-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-use"">immediate pause to the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) vaccine</a>, GlobalData&rsquo;s infectious disease analyst Emily Martyn commented: &ldquo;This pause for J&amp;J is another terrible blow to global vaccination efforts &ndash; especially followed by J&amp;J&rsquo;s delayed Europe rollout, Australia&rsquo;s decision to decline use of the vaccine altogether, and the recent troubles seen by AstraZeneca. GlobalData believes that these developments will hamper current international vaccination efforts both in terms of available vaccine and decreased public confidence. US COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are also likely to see slowdown.</p>
<p>Further exacerbating the situation, these developments arose less than two weeks after 15 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine were disposed due to a human error mix up between ingredients at a production plant in Maryland, USA. As a result of the delayed production of new doses, and postponed approval until the FDA completes its investigation into the issue, the US government has reduced the allocation of the J&amp;J vaccine from five million doses to just 700,000 doses for the week commencing Monday 12 April. In aggregate, this has been a disastrous week for anyone hoping that J&amp;J&rsquo;s single-dose vaccine would rapidly help quell the outbreak, according to Ms Martyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With variants of SARS-CoV-2 such as B.117 spreading rapidly through Europe, slowing the outbreak and reducing the incidence of new COVID-19 cases will depend heavily on vaccination efforts. Continued vaccination of vulnerable people is urgently needed to prevent severe cases and deaths from COVID-19. While there are few alternatives to the J&amp;J vaccine, vaccine hesitancy is a public health issue of significant importance. J&amp;J and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccines both utilize an adenoviral vector platform, which might be why both have similar side effects,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h2><strong>C4X shows being early to the party can bring success</strong></h2>
<p>C4X Discovery&rsquo;s business model, of out-licensing rather than developing projects in house, looks like it is starting to deliver, commented Lisa Urquhart on Evaluate Vantage. This week the UK group announced a 414 million-euro ($494 million) biodollar <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/c4x-discovery-inks-lucrative-c4xd-oral-il-17a-inhibitor-deal"">licensing deal with Sanofi</a> for its oral pre-clinical IL-17A inhibitor program. While the upfront payment of 7 million euros was slightly more modest, landing a big-name partner was enough help drive shares in the UK biotech up by 8%.</p>
<p>The deal with Sanofi follows an agreement with Indivior in 2018, worth $10 million up front, and is all part of a plan by C4X's chief executive, Clive Dix, to hand off assets before they even hit the clinic. Speaking to <em>Evaluate Vantage</em> he said: &ldquo;We think our technology is best placed finding molecules, getting good quality starting points, taking them as far as we can as a candidate and out licensing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In C4X&rsquo;s deal with Sanofi, the French company will take on all of the risks and cost of commercializing the oral IL-17 inhibitor, which will be developed initially in psoriasis.</p>
<p>The current leading IL-17 inhibitor for psoriasis, Novartis's Cosentyx, sold almost $3 billion for this use last year, but as a MAb it tends to be reserved for more severe forms of the disorder.</p>
<p>The deal with Sanofi has brought some renewed investor interest in the company, whose shares had hit historic lows earlier this year. But at 43 pence the stock is&nbsp;still a long way off the 130p it hit in 2016, making C4X look relatively cheap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mr Dix is not interested in selling anytime soon, said Mr Urquhart. &ldquo;The end goal is to make this a sustainable drug discovery engine. Roll forward five or six years and if we have done another three deals, then you have an expectation of revenues coming in all the time and it&rsquo;s a fairly chunky business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>","2021-04-18 10:38:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 16, 2021","News review, Biogen, Sage Therapeutics, SAGE-324, Roche, Regeneron, REGEN-COV, Merck & Co, MK-7119, Johnson & Johnson, C4X Discovery, Sanofi, COVID-19","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 16, 2021",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-18 10:36:10","2021-04-18 10:53:20",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-16-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Autoimmune Disorders, CNS Diseases, Infectious diseases, Neurological, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Deals, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"Biogen, C4X Discovery, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche, Sage Therapeutics, Sanofi","MK-7110, REGEN-COV2, SAGE-324",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo, which generated global sales of $7 billion in 2020, in combination with certain types of chemotherapy, for the initial treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>This is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for the first-line treatment of gastric cancer. The FDA&rsquo;s Oncology Center of Excellence director Dr Richard Pazdur, said Opdivo is the first treatment in more than a decade to show a survival benefit for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who are being treated for the first time, adding that there are roughly 28,000 new diagnoses of gastric cancer a year in the USA.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>Efficacy was evaluated in CHECKMATE-649 (NCT02872116), a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial that enrolled 1,581 patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, or esophageal adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) was determined centrally using the Agilent/Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test. Patients received nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy (n=789) or chemotherapy alone (n=792); study treatment was administered as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nivolumab 240mg with mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) every 2 weeks, or mFOLFOX6 every two weeks.</li>
<li>Nivolumab 360 mg with CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) every three weeks, or CapeOX every three weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In CheckMate -649, Opdivo plus chemotherapy combination significantly improved survival for patients with metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, reducing the risk of death by 20%. Additionally, 55% of patients were still alive at one year,&rdquo; said Dr Yelena Janjigian, CheckMate -649 principal investigator and chief of gastrointestinal oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, adding: &ldquo;These findings are important, reinforcing the potential of this Opdivo -based combination as a standard of care for this population of patients in high need of treatment options that may extend their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The application was reviewed under the FDA&rsquo;s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. The review was also conducted under the FDA&rsquo;s Project Orbis initiative, enabling concurrent review by the health authorities in Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Brazil.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, BMS announced that the European Medicines Agency <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bms-latest-opdivo-submission-validated-by-ema"">validated its Type II Variation</a> Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Opdivo in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (GC), gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

<p>Based on its ongoing analysis of emerging scientific data, specifically the sustained increase of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants that are resistant to bamlanivimab alone resulting in the increased risk for treatment failure, the FDA has determined that the known and potential benefits of bamlanivimab, when administered alone, no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for its authorized use.</p>
<p>Therefore, the agency determined that the criteria for issuance of an authorization are no longer met and has revoked the EUA. The drug continues to be authorized for use together with etesevimab under EUA 094.</p>
<h2><strong>EUA issued in November 2020</strong></h2>
<p>On November 9, 2020, based on the totality of scientific evidence available at the time, the FDA issued an EUA to US pharma major Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) authorizing the emergency use of bamlanivimab alone for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.</p>
<p>Last October, ahead of the EUA granting, Eli Lilly announced an initial agreement with the US government to supply 300,000 vials of bamlanivimab 700mg for $375 million.</p>
<p>Importantly, although the FDA is now revoking this EUA, alternative monoclonal antibody therapies remain available under EUA, including <a href=""https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA0MTYuMzg5NDk3NjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mZGEuZ292L21lZGlhLzE0NTYxMC9kb3dubG9hZD91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkifQ.eMd9htWKShopueHfLAFP0dc9MAtL3jNSK75MuF5Dpqc/s/1255922260/br/102596253589-l"">REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab, administered together)</a>, and <a href=""https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA0MTYuMzg5NDk3NjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mZGEuZ292L21lZGlhLzE0NTgwMS9kb3dubG9hZD91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkifQ.q2lpUWmw1rREtINRPkksOf93JxeTH0Xx5GR4CI_k7Tw/s/1255922260/br/102596253589-l"">bamlanivimab and etesevimab, administered together</a>, for the same uses as previously authorized for bamlanivimab alone.

<p>&ldquo;Lupus nephritis is a serious chronic disease, one that has a disproportionately large impact on Black, Hispanic, and other communities of color in the US,&rdquo; said ICER president Steven Pearson, adding: &ldquo;Both belimumab and voclosporin are important new treatment options. Despite remaining uncertainty about both treatments&rsquo; longer-term outcomes, their estimated prices appear to be aligned with their anticipated clinical benefits. More research is needed to confirm these benefits, but for patients and clinicians to have responsibly priced options specifically indicated for lupus nephritis is a major win for patients and the entire health system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;One policy element that was discussed at the public meeting, however, is worth attention. Aurinia sought and achieved a late-stage patent on voclosporin&rsquo;s dosing protocol. This unusual patent will likely deny patients access to a more affordable generic version of the treatment until 2037 &ndash; a full 10 years beyond what was previously expected. If extended patents through dosing algorithms becomes a new trend, we could see future budget headroom shrink for other innovative products, while patients and the entire health system struggle even more with affordability.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Voting on long-term value for money</strong></h2>
<p>After reviewing the clinical evidence and considering the treatments&rsquo; other potential benefits, disadvantages, and contextual considerations noted above, the New England CEPAC evaluated the long-term value for these treatments.</p>
<p>A majority of panelists found that belimumab, at its current pricing, represents &ldquo;high&rdquo; long-term value for money. The estimated annual price for belimumab is $43,000 for patients who remain on treatment, lower than the ICER&rsquo;s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range of around $45,000-$61,000 per year.</p>
<p>A majority of panelists found that voclosporin, at its current pricing, represents &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; long-term value for money. The estimated annual price for voclosporin is $92,000, towards the higher end of the ICER&rsquo;s recommended HBPB of about $72,000-$101,000 per year.</p>
<h2><strong>Key policy recommendations&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Following the voting session, a policy roundtable of experts - including clinical experts, patient advocates, and representatives from US payers and relevant pharmaceutical companies - convened to discuss the implications of the evidence for policy and practice. Key recommendations stemming from the roundtable discussion include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All stakeholders have a responsibility and an important role to play in ensuring that effective new treatment options for patients with lupus nephritis are introduced in a way that will help reduce health inequities.</li>
<li>Both belimumab and voclosporin are judged to be priced in reasonable alignment with estimates of their benefits for patients, and this consideration should guide payers to design coverage criteria that do not narrow coverage from the FDA label, although coverage criteria may define terms left indeterminate in the FDA label to assure appropriate use.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Manufacturers should commit to expanding their research, both before and after regulatory approval, to include adequate representation of patients with lupus nephritis from Black and other non-white populations.</li>
<li>Manufacturers should not seek to use common sense dosing algorithms as a tool to gain prolongation of their patents, thereby adding to future health care affordability concerns and reducing the headroom for future innovative therapies.</li>

488370,,"New data attest to benefits of Kesimpta in MS","Swiss pharma giant Novartis has announced new post hoc data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials of Kesimpta (ofatumumab).","<p>Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) has announced new post hoc data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials of Kesimpta (ofatumumab).</p>
<p>The data will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), being held virtually between April 17 and April 22.</p>
<p>Novartis said the results further support Kesimpta as a first-choice treatment option for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).</p>
<h2>Kesimpta development</h2>
<p>Approved in the USA in August 2020, Kesimpta is the first targeted B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home, via the Sensoready autoinjector pen.</p>
<p>The drug is being developed and marketed globally under a license agreement with Danish biotech firm Genmab (Nasdaq: GMAB).</p>
<p>With a patient-friendly mode of administration, Novartis hopes to be able to distinguish its option from Roche&rsquo;s (ROG: SIX) intravenous Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), another anti-CD20 antibody, which analysts expect to be market leader in coming years.</p>
<p>One obstacle for Novartis may be price, with the wholesale cost of the product reported to be over $80,000, more expensive than Ocrevus.</p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency approved Kesimpta for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features on March 30, 2021, while other regulatory submissions are underway globally.</p>
<p>Ofatumumab is also already approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which indication it is marketed under the trade name Arzerra.</p>
<h2>AAN presentation</h2>
<p>The new analysis shows Kesimpta reduced the risk of disability progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) at three and six months, compared with teriflunomide.</p>
<p>Teriflunomide is developed by French pharma major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN), and is sold under the brand name Aubagio.</p>
<p>The analysis relates to a subgroup of people with RMS who were newly diagnosed and had not been treated before.</p>
<p>In a statement, Novartis said that PIRA was &ldquo;an emerging endpoint used in MS trials to measure disability worsening independent of relapses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estelle Vester-Blokland, global head of neuroscience medical affairs at Novartis, said: &ldquo;Evidence shows that progression occurs in people living with MS in the early stages of disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;This reinforces the need to treat early with a first-choice treatment like Kesimpta, which combines powerful efficacy with a favorable safety profile and can be self-administered at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All abstracts will be published in the journal Neurology following the meeting.</p>","2021-04-16 13:21:00",,"data, attest, benefits, Kesimpta","Swiss pharma giant Novartis has announced new post hoc data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials of Kesimpta (ofatumumab).",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-16 13:20:44","2021-04-16 16:45:38",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/new-data-attest-to-benefits-of-kesimpta-in-ms,,,,,,2020_novartis_big.jpg,2020_novartis_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases","AAN, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research","Denmark, Switzerland, USA","Genmab, Novartis",Kesimpta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>With more virulent strains spreading across the world while billions of people go unvaccinated, the risk of variants resistant to current vaccines emerges, so Independent SAGE wants the UK government to support a waiver of the global agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property (TRIPS) at the World Trade Organization.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The project with Seagen represents just one of six clinical-stage assets Genmab has in equal split partnerships, working with an impressive range of global drugmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The firm is collaborating with companies including AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and rising mRNA superstar BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX), with agreements to co-develop and jointly commercialize resulting products.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It&rsquo;s no surprise, therefore, that Dr van de Winkel says the firm&rsquo;s product pipeline is &ldquo;maturing rapidly,&rdquo; with the company &ldquo;at a pivotal moment&rdquo; in its development.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He believes Genmab can become &ldquo;a fully integrated biotech innovation powerhouse, first focusing on two priority markets, the USA and Japan,&rdquo; to which end the company is currently &ldquo;scaling with purpose, precision and agility.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Pushing past the pandemic</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In response to the unique challenges posed by the novel coronavirus, Dr van de Winkel personally oversaw the establishment of a &ldquo;COVID-19 response team&rdquo; to keep the company&rsquo;s mission on track.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The goal was to implement &ldquo;precautionary measures to help limit the impact of COVID-19 at our workplace and on our communities while ensuring business continuity.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The firm is &ldquo;actively monitoring the potential impact on our key priorities and assessing the situation on an ongoing basis in close contact with clinical trial sites, physicians and contract research organizations,&rdquo; he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite the pandemic, Genmab was able to achieve key milestones in 2020 including the establishment of a &ldquo;landmark oncology collaboration with AbbVie,&rdquo; as well as opening translational research labs in New Jersey, USA.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2020 was not all plain sailing, however, with the firm entering into a legal battle with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) over royalties for cancer drug Darzalex (daratumumab).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Genmab commenced arbitration proceedings in order to settle whether or not it should share its royalties for a subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab with US biotech Halozyme Therapeutics (Nasdaq: HALO).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since analysts had expected Genmab to continue receiving royalties through to 2035, the news knocked a tenth off the firm&rsquo;s share price, with a binding arbitration process leaving open potential for a truncated payment schedule.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Collaboration and independence</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since its inception, Genmab has had a strong focus on partnering to achieve its aims.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dr van de Winkel says &ldquo;collaboration and networking has always been a part of our DNA,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;we believe partnerships are foundational to accelerate innovation and bring truly differentiated medicines to patients as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spun out of American biotech Medarex in 1999, the Copenhagen-based company began producing monoclonal antibodies for life-threatening or life-altering diseases, quickly drawing interest from investors and going public in October 2000.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During its early phase of growth, the firm partnered with large companies, &ldquo;who had the capability and expertise for developing and commercializing clinical assets.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>However, Ocrevus is expected to face tough competition in the near future. The strongest direct to watch for is Swiss rival Novartis&rsquo; (NOVN: VX) Kesimpta (ofatumumab), which was Food and Drug Administration-approved in August 2020 for patients with different forms of RMS.</p>
<h2><strong>More people with MS are staying on Ocrevus</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;All patients regardless of their form of MS experience disease progression from the start. Therefore, we are encouraged by these new analyses showing that early treatment with Ocrevus may significantly control disease progression in both relapsing-remitting MS and in primary progressive MS. Controlling progression can enable people with MS to maintain mobility and limit their disability,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer and head of global product development. &ldquo;In addition, our data show that more people with MS are staying on Ocrevus, the only twice-yearly treatment for MS, compared with other therapies, which may translate to improved outcomes.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> <strong>Two-year US claims analysis</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 80% of patients adhered to twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing of Ocrevus after their second year of treatment compared with other DMTs, which were grouped by administration route (35% adherence to injectables, 55% to orals and 54% to other infusions), in a new analysis of US commercial and insurance claims databases. Ocrevus also had the highest proportion of patients (75%) persist with therapy at two years (33% with injectables, 54% with orals and 55% with other infusions).</p>","2021-04-16 12:26:00","Strong new data for Roche’s Ocrevus in MS","Roche, Ocrevus, Multiple sclerosis, PPMS, RRMS, AAN meeting, Novartis, Kesimpta","Strong new data for Roche’s Ocrevus in MS",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-16 11:49:17","2021-04-16 12:26:23",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strong-new-data-for-roche-s-ocrevus-in-ms,,,,,,ocrevus_large.png,ocrevus_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,MS,Biotechnology,"Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Rare diseases","AAN, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research",Switzerland,"Novartis, Roche","Kesimpta, Ocrevus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488366,,"Listening to patients: The FDA goes from strength to strength","In seeking guidance on how to improve the regulatory process to enable access to much-needed treatments, who better to listen to than patients and caregivers?","<p>In seeking guidance on how to improve the regulatory process to enable access to much-needed treatments, who better to listen to than patients and caregivers? They are the stakeholders with the greatest understanding of which therapeutic solutions will help them manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. With this in mind, the US Food and Drug Administration has developed several programs to encourage the patient voice in drug development and healthcare.</p>
<h2><strong>Patient Listening Sessions</strong></h2>
<p>Hosted by the FDA&rsquo;s Office of Patient Affairs (OPA), together with the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and the Reagan-Udall Foundation, Patient Listening Sessions are small and informal conversations that bring patients/caregivers and researchers together.<sup>1</sup> These sessions are aimed at complementing the FDA&rsquo;s existing patient engagement initiatives.</p>
<p>The agency has been conducting listening sessions since 2018, with a focus on disease experience rather than a particular medical drug, biologic, or device.<sup>2</sup> Thus, only patients, caregivers, patient advocates and staff of FDA Centers and programs are generally allowed to participate.</p>
<p>For FDA medical product staff, Patient Listening Sessions are a resource for directly hearing from patients about their disease experience and gaining a view of the patient and caregiver perspectives. For the patient/caregiver, they are an opportunity to share their stories freely, advocate for patient needs and directly educate regulatory decision-making.</p>
<p>Sessions can either be FDA-requested or patient-led:</p>
<ul>
<li>FDA-requested sessions are instituted by FDA staff, where they ask questions to patients/caregivers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Patient-led sessions are when members of the patient community actively share their stories while FDA personnel simply listen.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the FDA&rsquo;s list of concluded sessions, patient-led sessions have been conducted more frequently.<sup>2 </sup>Additional patient-led sessions are also already scheduled for later this year, including sessions to discuss lupus, SCN2A-related disorders (epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (a spinal cord disorder). This trend indicates that patients truly yearn to have a forum where they can speak directly with regulators.</p>
<p>The aim of these sessions is to harness the patient voice as a guidepost in the research and development of future treatments and to overcome any hurdles that may be blocking the approval of much-needed treatments. For example, a recent listening session with hemophilia patients resulted in the creation of a public workshop and an online resource to inform the design of product development and clinical trial design in hemophilia.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, the FDA has made it possible to continually listen to patients through online means. For example, a session with the Von Hippel Lindau Alliance (VHLA) on June 11, 2020 was conducted via video conference.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>While discussions during these sessions are unofficial and not binding for the FDA, they offer a valuable resource for regulatory agency staff and support patient advocacy.</p>
<h2><strong>The Patient Engagement Collaborative (PEC)</strong></h2>
<p>The FDA&rsquo;s OPA also coordinates the PEC. In contrast to the Patient Listening Sessions, the PEC is an ongoing forum not only among patients and the FDA but also including other healthcare stakeholders. The FDA established the Collaborative together with the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative, which is a partnership that brings together representatives from regulatory agencies, patient advocacy groups, clinical investigators, academia, government, and industry, among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inaugurated in August 2018, the PEC was borne out of patient community feedback that expressed the need for an outside group tasked to inform on patient engagement across the Agency. The Collaborative seeks to identify new models, communication tools and systems to enhance patient engagement, patient experience and transparency&nbsp;in the regulatory process.<sup>6</sup></p>
<h2><strong>The FDA Patient Representative Program</strong><strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>This program is considered a flagship program of the FDA, prompting the agency to have its title trademarked. The FDA&rsquo;s Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff (ACOMS) manages the program, appointing members to the advisory committee as temporary Special Government Employees (SGEs). Patients and advocates are included among appointed persons.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The FDA Patient Representative Program<sup>&reg;</sup> offers patients and caregivers the opportunity to voice their needs, priorities, preferences and advice on medical product development and decision-making. FDA Patient Representatives are tasked to serve on the FDA Advisory Committees and panels, where expert advice on policy and scientific and technical matters are drawn out. They also provide insights on medical product development early in the regulatory and development process and consult with the FDA&rsquo;s review divisions.</p>
<p>The program is a deeper incorporation of the patient voice than the previous programs discussed, as the patient is integrated directly, although temporarily, into the FDA. Not only do FDA staff directly gain valuable information on patient experiences with various diseases and therapeutic devices, but select patients also gain access to confidential information.</p>
<h2><strong>Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Programs</strong></h2>
<p>The FDA&rsquo;s CDRH has programs designed to listen to the patient voice and inform on medical device decision-making. For example, it manages the Patient Engagement Advisory Committee (PEAC), which is mostly composed of patients, caregivers, or patient organization representatives with voting rights. The PEAC is not disease-specific but has a broad view of issues from patient access to medical devices and technical topics such as digital health technology and real-world data.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Another example is the Patient and Caregiver Connection (PCC), where the CDRH partners with patient organizations so that FDA staff can formally engage with patients and caregivers. What makes the PCC different from the Patient Learning Sessions is that it focuses on the patient experience in specific diseases, especially on their experience with the use of medical devices either for diagnosis, disease management or treatment.<sup>9</sup> As early as 2016, the FDA had established a public docket to receive input from patients, care partners and patient organizations to identify ways to best build patient partnerships in line with the PCC program.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The FDA has maintained patient engagement initiatives over the years, adding to and improving efforts with increasingly innovative initiatives. Patients are in the best position to inform on their disease experience and any unmet medical needs, and the FDA is doing its part to make sure the patient voice is heard.</p>

<p>The programs in question are being progressed by Affimed, a German clinical-stage biotech, using ICE technology developed by XOMA.</p>
<p>They are the result of a 2006 agreement, under which Affimed in-licensed certain XOMA technologies to further its research and discovery efforts.</p>
<p>The Californian company is eligible to receive undisclosed payments on future commercial sales of each of the three ICE molecules and any pre-loaded NK cells containing the ICE molecules.</p>
<p>In addition, XOMA is eligible to receive an undisclosed milestone for each program should marketing approval be achieved.</p>

<p>Under development at UK pharma major GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and partner Vir Biotechnology (Nasdaq: VIR), VIR-7831 is intended for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40kg) with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>The review is being carried out by the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004 and will provide EU-wide recommendations for national authorities who may take evidence-based decisions on the early use of the medicine, ahead of any formal Marketing Authorization Application.</p>
<p>The review will include data from an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase III COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which evaluated VIR-7831 as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization. Results of the interim analysis, based on data from 583 randomized patients, demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalization or death in those receiving VIR-7831 compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. As a result, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy. The CHMP review will also consider data on the medicine&rsquo;s quality and safety.</p>

<p>This week, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of the Department of Health, granted VIR-7831 a provisional determination. VIR-7831 is the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody to have been granted this designation which provides a formal and transparent mechanism for accelerating the registration of promising new medicines with preliminary clinical data</p>
<p>VIR-7831 is an investigational compound and has not been granted a marketing authorization anywhere in the world. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for VIR-7831 has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p>Such an approval will also motivate uptake in countries within vaccine alliance Gavi, says analytics company GlobalData.</p>
<p>Interim analysis for AZD1222 on March 25 showed the vaccine to be 76% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. However, initial interim results made public on March 22, showed that it was 79% effective.</p>
<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s infectious diseases analyst Arafa Salam commented: &ldquo;Although there is not a significant difference between 79% and 76%, the fact that AstraZeneca had to revise its data meant that AZD1222 fueled doubt among the public. This was made worse by the reports of people developing unusual blood clots, which affected 37 out of roughly 17 million people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite this rare development, the safety data for AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccine were reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Although the majority of the 20 countries that suspended use of the vaccine resumed use after the EMA concluded that the vaccine was safe, some countries such as Norway extended their suspensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AstraZeneca must regain public trust if it is to be a greater contender in the COVID-19 vaccine space. An EUA authorization win might just be the ticket and boost usage globally.

488349,,"XOMA: The royalty aggregator that thinks like a biotech","For biotech companies, the prospect of receiving non-dilutive, non-recourse funding to advance their assets even through the early stages of clinical development may sound too good to be true.","<p>For biotech companies, the prospect of receiving non-dilutive, non-recourse funding to advance their assets even through the early stages of clinical development may sound too good to be true.</p>
<p>But that is exactly what is offered by XOMA (Nasdaq: XOMA), a unique company that started to provide an alternative financing model as a result of its own experiences as a biotech company.</p>
<h2>&lsquo;Nice clean way to bring cash into the balance sheet&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Jim Neal (pictured), XOMA&rsquo;s chief executive, explained: &ldquo;We provide an alternative mechanism for biotech companies to raise capital. If early stage licensed assets are being viewed as non-strategic or their potential to deliver financial value is years away, we offer a way for the company to be able to monetize those licenses and raise immediate capital from XOMA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a nutshell, we provide capital upfront, in exchange for a promise to receive milestone payments and royalties in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are clear advantages to what XOMA offers, Mr Neal added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your equity holders are dilution sensitive, this is non-dilutive to the equity holders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re thinking about debt, this is non-recourse, as we don&rsquo;t take a security interest in the company. Royalty monetization is a nice clean way to bring cash into the balance sheet without recourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was XOMA&rsquo;s own experience of seeking financing on those terms and there being no royalty aggregators interested in purchasing licenses to early stage clinical development assets that alerted the company to this important gap in the drug development ecosystem.</p>
<h2>A one-off in an emerging field</h2>
<p>XOMA&rsquo;s experiences since 2017&mdash;which is when it transformed itself from a traditional biotech platform company to a royalty aggregator, initially with its own portfolio of out-licensed assets&mdash;have proven the wider demand for this attractive funding mechanism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two-thirds of the assets in today&rsquo;s portfolio are from XOMA&rsquo;s legacy history as a biotech company doing antibody discovery and development and out-licensing. We have added a significant number of assets to our portfolio through multiple acquisition transactions since the 2017 pivot,&rdquo; Mr Neal said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s strong evidence that this is potentially an attractive fund raising option, and, while it&rsquo;s not for every company, we are seeing increasing interest in royalty monetization as an alternative financing vehicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A further indication of this was the $2.2 billion raised last year in a huge initial public offering by Royalty Pharma (Nasdaq: RPRX), the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties.</p>
<p>Yet XOMA is a one-off in the emerging royalty aggregator field, Mr Neal said.</p>
<p>He explained: &ldquo;Two things make us unique: we look for the presence of an existing license between the biotech company and the pharma company&mdash;that&rsquo;s our first screening criteria. The second critical component is we are willing to do a monetization transaction when the underlying drug candidate is in the Phase II or Phase I development stage. By being willing to do that, we&rsquo;re very unique. We can take on the risk associated with earlier stage licensed assets because we have a portfolio of 65+ assets today that genuinely share the same characteristics&mdash;the underlying asset is partnered with well-financed, capable development partners.</p>
<h2>&lsquo;We have lived in the shoes of a biotech&rsquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is a reason that XOMA stands alone in what it does. We have a 35-year history as an antibody company, and over that history, we invested $1 billion in those scientific endeavours, which resulted in dozens of partnerships and milestone and royalty licenses. Ordinarily, the chances of any one of the assets reaching the market from Phase I/II are slim, but with so many in the portfolio, the likelihood of one or several becoming a blockbuster become very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>XOMA is particularly confident of this happening because of its expertise in selecting those candidates. While Mr Neal has been with the company since 2009, chief financial officer Tom Burns joined in 2006.</p>
<p>The pair&rsquo;s understanding of the value of XOMA&rsquo;s licensed assets led them to see the value in allowing them to mature in the hands of the partners and to transform the company.</p>
<p>Mr Neal said: &ldquo;People like me who have been in the business for multiple years, who have done deals, know deals, and have deep connections within the biotech network, know where to look for opportunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lived in the shoes of the biotech company we are doing a deal with, so we know where they are. We also know how to construct and structure an arrangement that&rsquo;s win-win.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Within sight of Phase III trials</h2>
<p>While all of this is a new way of financing in the life sciences arena, royalty monetization has actually been used successfully in other industries for quite some time, though the ultimate validation of XOMA&rsquo;s approach will not come until its portfolio assets hit the market and start paying back royalties. That time is slowly coming into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, we have Phase II assets primarily in the portfolio, but if you scroll forward a few years, the center of gravity of that portfolio now moves to Phase III, and all of a sudden it&rsquo;s a very, very interesting portfolio,&rdquo; Mr Neal said.</p>
<p>As assets reach Phase III and, hopefully, gain regulatory approval and start delivering royalties, XOMA will at the same time continue enhancing its portfolio by adding more early stage candidates with new transactions.</p>
<p>The most recent such deal was the $13.5 million deal announced in March with Viracta Therapeutics (Nasdaq: VIRX) to buy potential future milestones and royalties associated with existing licenses relating to two clinical-stage drugs.</p>
<p>Milestone payments will also continue to come in, such as the $25 million that came from Novartis (NYSE: NVS) in the fall of 2020 when NIS793, an anti-TGF&beta; monoclonal antibody licensed from XOMA, advanced to the Phase II development stage.</p>
<p>From that asset alone, XOMA has the potential to earn over $400 million in additional milestone payments followed by tiered royalties on any net product sales that range from the mid-single digits to the low double digits.</p>
<h2>Playing a long game</h2>
<p>With the potential to generate such sums and with a small team and no research and development or commercialization expenses to cover, it is no wonder that Wall Street is learning to love XOMA&rsquo;s strategy. The company&rsquo;s share price has shot up by more than 800% since the early 2017 pivot.</p>
<p>The transformation followed on from a catalyst investment by the Biotechnology Value Fund (BVF), with Matthew Perry, president of BVF Partners, joining an experienced XOMA board, all of whom will help to guide the company on a path ahead that, while exciting, will require patience.</p>
<p>Mr Neal once remarked that &ldquo;all you have to do is be around long enough&rdquo; to realize the value in the portfolio, because rather than selling on assets when they reach Phase III or are subject to New Drug Applications, XOMA plans to hang on and see the return on them, delivering value back to the shareholders.</p>

<p>The company has been testing the therapy as an option to treat symptoms of the disease, including cough, dyspnea, chills and fever.</p>
<p>While the trial missed its primary endpoint of improvement in these symptoms, a relevant secondary efficacy endpoint did reach statistical significance, with a reduction in subsequent visits to the emergency room, compared with placebo.</p>
<p>Covis, a Zug-based global specialty pharmaceutical company, markets therapeutic solutions for patients with life-threatening conditions and chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>The firm offers the glucocorticoid in an inhalable format under the brand name Alvesco, for long-term treatment of asthma in certain people in the USA and Canada.</p>
<p>Steering committee member Michael Blaiss said: &ldquo;We are disappointed the results were not more positive, although there was a trend toward earlier cough cessation in the ciclesonide group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Further studies may want to look at whether this treatment may prevent or lessen post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In older people, muscle aging causes loss of strength, mobility, and function, driving mortality and multiple age-related diseases and decreasing overall quality of life. APJ and its natural agonist apelin are components of a signaling pathway that regulates multiple aspects of muscle metabolism, growth, and repair.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the license accord, which covers all indications, BioAge will make an upfront payment to Amgen, which is entitled to receive development and regulatory milestone payments plus royalties based on annual net sales. Amgen will also receive an unspecified number of shares in BioAge. BioAge will be responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercialization of BGE-105 worldwide.</p>
<h2><strong>Second buy-in this year</strong></h2>
<p>This is the second in-licensing deal this year for BioAge, which in January picked up exclusive US and European development and marketing rights to the DP1 receptor antagonist, BGE-175, in COVID-19, from Osaka, Japan-based Shionogi (TYO: 4507). The firm has also obtained exclusive rights to negotiate a license for additional indications.</p>
<p>BGE-105 is a potent APJ agonist that can be administered orally or intravenously. Phase I clinical trials completed in 2019 in 198 subjects who received the drug for up to 21 days showed that BGE-105 had a tolerable safety profile, with acceptable pharmacokinetics (PK) supporting once-daily administration. BioAge&rsquo;s first clinical trial of BGE-105, planned for initiation in the first quarter of 2022 under the existing investigational new drug (IND), will be a Phase I study comparing the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of BGE-105 in humans with those seen in previous trials examining the effects of the apelin peptide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BioAge&rsquo;s advanced proprietary platform comprehensively analyzes longitudinal human data to identify key molecular drivers of aging, which we then validate in preclinical experiments,&rdquo; said Kristen Fortney, BioAge&rsquo;s chief executive, adding: &ldquo;Using this robust approach, we found that higher levels of apelin signalling in older people are associated with increased lifespan and reduced symptoms of frailty. Our human-first analysis suggests that the apelin-mimicking drug BGE-105 could recapitulate these positive effects in older patients.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-15 16:34:00","BioAge signs deal with Amgen to develop Phase I APJ agonist","BioAge Labs, Amgen, License, Agreement, APJ agonist, AMG 986, BGE;105","BioAge signs deal with Amgen to develop Phase I APJ agonist",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-15 16:33:16","2021-04-15 16:50:33",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bioage-signs-deal-with-amgen-to-develop-phase-i-apj-agonist,,,,,,bioage_big.jpg,bioage_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Musculoskeletal,"Deals, Licensing, One to Watch Companies, Research",USA,"Amgen, BioAge Labs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The international investment syndicate is led by RA Capital Management, with participation from Lightstone Ventures, Data Collective VC (DCVC), DHVC, SV Health Investors and the Dementia Discovery Fund. The company was created by SV Health Investors who led the Seed round in 2019.</p>
<p>The proceeds will be used to advance Alchemab&rsquo;s unique target-agnostic drug discovery platform. The approach interrogates the entire antibody repertoires of individuals from well-defined groups who show unexpected resistance to disease despite genetic disposition or other risk factors predicative of a poor prognosis. Using insights gained, Alchemab can identify naturally protective antibodies with therapeutic potential. Alchemab&rsquo;s primary focus is the development of novel therapeutics for hard-to-treat neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, and the company currently has several programs at the pre-clinical stage.</p>
<p>Alchemab&rsquo;s approach was developed with support from scientific founders at Oxford University, Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Hospital. Alchemab is amongst the first commercial group to access Illumina&rsquo;s Cambridge, UK Accelerator.</p>
<h2><strong>Aims to be a major player in the identification of novel targets</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Our aim is to become a major player in the identification of novel targets and antibodies in the areas of neurodegeneration and cancer,&rdquo; noted Alex Leech, chief executive at Alchemab. &ldquo;The substantial financial commitment by this high-caliber group of US and European investors is a strong endorsement of our science and team,&rdquo;<em> he noted.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Ravulizumab is the first approved, long-acting complement inhibitor that provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition with only six or seven infusions per year instead of 26 with eculizumab, while delivering comparable safety and efficacy, said Alexion, which is currently the subject of a $39 billion takeover bid from UK pharma major AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) that was announced in December.</p>
<p>The drug&rsquo;s sales are expected to reach $1.66 billion by 2022, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Ultomiris is expected to become the successor in PNH to Alexion's own Soliris.</p>
<h2><strong>New standard of care for patients with PNH</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted at the recommendation from NICE, meaning we will be able to offer ravulizumab as a new treatment option to adult patients with PNH across the UK, helping to improve their overall quality of life,&rdquo; said Sean Richardson, Alexion general manager, UK &amp; Ireland. &ldquo;We believe ravulizumab will become the new standard of care for patients with PNH by providing immediate and complete C5 inhibition, sustained throughout the eight-week dosing interval,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>PNH is a debilitating ultra-rare blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis) as well as risk of blood clots (thrombosis), which can occur throughout the body, and result in organ damage and premature death.</p>
<p>It impacts approximately 16 people per million in the UK, and can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s.</p>
<p>PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis ranging from one to more than five years.

488357,,"Diurnal withdraws EMA orphan designation request for Efmody/Chronocort","UK endocrine diseases specialist Diurnal Group has withdrawn its application for maintenance of orphan designation in Europe for Efmody (hydrocortisone modified-release hard capsules), a drug formerly known as Chronocort.","<p>UK endocrine diseases specialist Diurnal Group (AIM: DNL) has withdrawn its application for maintenance of orphan designation in Europe for Efmody (hydrocortisone modified-release hard capsules), a drug formerly known as Chronocort.</p>
<p>This follows feedback from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), an advisory committee to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p>
<p>Diurnal has decided that continuing pursuit of an orphan designation for the drug would be likely to cause a significant delay in its European commercial launch. First commercial launch is currently anticipated to be in the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""A robust, granted European patent estate provides market exclusivity for the drug until at least 2033""</span>Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), an advisory committee of the EMA, issued a positive opinion to the European Commission recommending Efmody as treatment of adult and adolescent patients with the rare condition congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).</p>
<p>The formal approval of marketing authorization from the European Commission for Efmody, which is not dependant on the maintenance of orphan designation, continues to be anticipated in June 2021, in accordance with the 67-day mandated timeline following the adoption of a positive opinion by the CHMP.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this and commercial launch shortly thereafter, market access activities in Diurnal&rsquo;s target European territories are underway.</p>
<p>Orphan designation provides for market exclusivity for 10 years from launch. However, the company currently holds granted European patents for Efmody for the treatment of patients with both CAH and adrenal insufficiency (AI) and believes these patents provide sufficient protection for Efmody until at least 2033 in all designated states covered by the European Patent Convention.</p>
<p>In addition, while orphan designation can be used to support premium pricing in certain territories, Diurnal does not believe that this is critical to the overall commercial potential of the product given the significant clinical need for new therapies in CAH.</p>
<p>Martin Whitaker, chief executive of Diurnal, said: &ldquo;Following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP we are focussed on the timely launch of Efmody in Q3 2021. Orphan Designation for Efmody in Europe is not critical to the commercial potential of the product in this market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There remains a strong clinical rationale for the drug&rsquo;s use to address the significant need for new therapies to improve outcomes for adult patients with CAH. This was highlighted recently in the paper in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism that detailed our pivotal clinical trial data and results from a long-term extension study. Additionally, a robust, granted European patent estate provides market exclusivity for the drug until at least 2033.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-15 14:50:00",,"orphan, designation, European, Diurnal, Efmody, drug, market, launch, commercial, committee, maintenance, Europe, withdraws, exclusivity, Efmody/Chronocort","UK endocrine diseases specialist Diurnal Group has withdrawn its application for maintenance of orphan designation in Europe for Efmody (hydrocortisone modified",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-15 12:56:50","2021-04-15 14:50:20",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/diurnal-withdraws-ema-orphan-designation-request-for-efmody-chronocort,,,,,,diurnal_logo-_big.jpg,diurnal_logo_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Endocrinology,"European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Regulation",Europe,"Diurnal Group, The European Medicines Agency","Chronocort, Efmody",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Merck acquired MK-7110 in December 2020 through its $425 million acquisition of OncoImmune, a privately-held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Merck subsequently received feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration that additional data, beyond the study conducted by OncoImmune, would be needed to support a potential Emergency Use Authorization application. Based on the additional research that would be required &ndash; new clinical trials as well as research related to manufacturing at scale &ndash; MK-7110 would not be expected to become available until the first half of 2022.</p>
<h2><strong>Will now focus on advancing molnupiravir</strong></h2>
<p>Given this timeline and these technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties, the availability of a number of medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the need to concentrate Merck&rsquo;s resources on accelerating the development and manufacture of the most viable therapeutics and vaccines, Merck has determined to discontinue development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and to focus its pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merck&rsquo;s commitment from the outset of the pandemic has been to deploy our expertise and capabilities where they can have the most impact,&rdquo; said Dr Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. &ldquo;Merck is now focusing its efforts on advancing molnupiravir, which, as an oral medicine for outpatient use, represents a promising potential new approach, and on accelerating production of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Second covid disappointment</strong></h2>
<p>Merck was a relatively late starter into the novel coronavirus scene, and this is the second disappointment for the company.</p>
<p>In January, Merck announced that it is <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-drops-two-covid-19-vaccine-candidates"">discontinuing development</a> of its SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine candidates, V590 and V591, and plans to focus its SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 research strategy and production capabilities on advancing two therapeutic candidates, MK-4482 and MK-7110.</p>
<p>The vaccine candidates were acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience, and V590, developed with non-profit research organization IAVI.</p>
<p>This decision followed Merck&rsquo;s review of findings from Phase I clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;</p>","2021-04-15 14:32:00","Merck to discontinue MK-7110 for COVID-19 development","Merck & Co, MK-7110, COVID-19, Development, Discontinued, OncoImmune","Merck to discontinue MK-7110 for COVID-19 development",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-15 14:30:50","2021-04-15 14:39:00",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-to-discontinue-mk-7110-for-covid-19-development,,,,,,merck_co_large.png,merck_co_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Research",USA,"Merck & Co, OncoImmune",MK-7110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488350,,"Record-breaking sales of $24.8bn by 2021 predicted for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine","Pfizer and BioNTech’s Comirnaty (tozinameran) is forecast to have peak sales of $24.8 billion by 2021, which is only its second year on the market.","<p>Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BNTX) Comirnaty (tozinameran) is forecast to have peak sales of $24.8 billion by 2021, which is only its second year on the market.</p>
<p>This is a 20% increase over Humira&rsquo;s peak sales of $20.5 billion, suggesting that Comirnaty could be the next top drug by peak sales within only two years of its launch, says analytics company GlobalData.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humira has been the top drug by sales for nearly a decade, despite having been on the market for nearly 20 years and having lost its market exclusivity within the EU in 2018 and Japan in 2017,&rdquo; noted GlobalData analyst for drugs database Quentin Horgan. &ldquo;The fact that Pfizer/BioNTech is estimated to end this reign after only two years is unprecedented and shows the power of this drug&rsquo;s high efficacy, its first-to-market status, the demand presented by ongoing vaccination programs and that&nbsp;Comirnaty is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 vaccines,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Since its UK approval as a COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, Comirnaty has received regulatory approval in multiple geographies, including the European Union and Japan. It has also gained Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) in other geographies such as the USS, Canada, Australia and Switzerland.</p>
<h2><strong>Improved storage requirements</strong></h2>
<p>In February 2021, the FDA approved Comirnaty to be stored at temperatures ranging from -25&deg;C to -15&deg;C (-13&deg;F to 5&deg;F) for a total of two weeks, which is much higher than its previous storage requirement of -80&deg;C (-112&deg;F).</p>
<p>Mr Horgan adds: &ldquo;This new temperature range places it on par with its rival, Moderna&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: MRNA) mRNA-1273. The temperature range also allows for greater flexibility in managing and maintaining Comirnaty&rsquo;s distribution and supply, and makes it more appealing to emerging markets, which do not have sufficient supercooling capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It remains to be seen if Comirnaty&rsquo;s actual sales in 2021 will meet these forecast predictions. Several vaccines have received EUAs and approvals, including Moderna&rsquo;s mRNA-1273, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AN) AZD-1222, and Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) JNJ-7843673; these may take market share away from Comirnaty.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-15 11:05:00","Record-breaking sales of $24.8bn by 2021 predicted for Pfizer/BioNTech","Pfizer, BioNTech, Comirnaty, COVID-19, Vaccine, Sales, Forecast, GlobalData, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna","Record-breaking sales of $24.8bn by 2021 predicted for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-15 10:05:00","2021-04-15 11:05:33",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/record-breaking-sales-of-24-8bn-by-2021-predicted-for-pfizer-biontech-s-vaccine,,,,,,biontech_vaccine_large.jpg,biontech_vaccine_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Markets & Marketing","Germany, Global, USA","AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlobalData, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer","Comirnaty, Tozinameran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>While the issue of substandard drugs is not new in India, its wider impact was highlighted with last year's recall of 632 medicines from local generic stores (Jan Aushadhi kendras) in Karnataka after they failed a drug quality standard test, and the recall of 106 batches of 52 drugs in the last four years by the Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India.<br /> <br /> Early this month, the Uttar Pradesh police cracked down on various gangs pushing pharmaceutical opioids and counterfeit drugs. Since there is a lot of consumption of sleeping medicines, antidepressants and painkillers in the region, the drug mafia has allegedly been creating a proxy demand for these drugs in the guise of providing these medications.<br /> <br /> A report related to the trade of illicit drugs in Agra notes the actual sale of pain and sleeping medicines is worth $33,286 per day. Recently, substandard opioid pain medication tramadol and codeine syrup worth about $66,572 was seized. Police personnel state the demand is very high for other drugs and painkillers like Spasco Proxyvan, nitrazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam and phensedyl.<br /> <br /> Last February, a crackdown by the Karnataka government had unearthed several substandard batches of generic medicines being sold at Jan Aushadi Kendras. These include common medicines like telmisartan and ramipril used to treat high blood pressure, nimesulide, a pain medication with fever-reducing properties, and even calamine lotion, used to treat mild itchiness.<br /> <br /> Though domestically-produced generics have often come under the scanner for failing quality tests, pain-relieving medicine tramadol and sleeping tablet alprazolam are being used by drug peddlers and illicit substandard consignments have found their way across the state.<br /> <br /> India has been battling the challenge of substandard drugs for a while. The Ministry of commerce and industry, Drug Controller and law enforcement agencies have come together to fight the menace of counterfeit drugs.</p>

<p>Under the settlement, Impax agreed to stay out of the market for two-and-a-half years in exchange for a substantial and unjustified payment from Endo, whose shares were upt 2.7% at $6.27 in early trading today0.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was more than enough evidence to support the unanimous view of the Commissioners . . . that a less restrictive alternative was viable,&rdquo; Judge Gregg Costa wrote in the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s opinion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled that the Fifth Circuit has upheld the FTC&rsquo;s opinion that pay-for-delay deals in the pharmaceutical industry harm consumers and thwart lower-cost generic drugs,&rdquo; said FTC Acting Chair Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, adding: &ldquo;This case is an important milestone in the decades of work by FTC staff to stop pay-for-delay agreements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s opinion held that the FTC staff had proven that the agreement between Impax and Endo Pharmaceuticals violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission&rsquo;s opinion reversed Chief Administrative Law Judge D Michael Chappell&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/05/administrative-law-judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint"">initial decision</a>.</p>

<p>The Commission&rsquo;s final order bars Impax from entering into any type of reverse payment that defers or restricts generic entry, including no-Authorized Generic commitments, as well as certain business transactions entered with the branded pharmaceutical manufacturer within 45 days of a patent settlement. The order also bars Impax from entering any agreement with another oxymorphone ER manufacturer that prevents or restricts competition between oxymorphone ER products.</p>

<p>Tagrisso, which is AstraZeneca&rsquo;s best-selling drug with 2020 sales of $4.33 billion, is indicated for EGFRm patients whose tumors have exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) mutations.</p>
<p>The approval by China&rsquo;s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) was based on positive results from the ADAURA Phase III trial. In the trial, Tagrisso demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the primary analysis population of patients with Stage II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC. The ADAURA trial also showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in DFS in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease, a key secondary endpoint.</p>
<h2><strong>Current approvals in China</strong></h2>
<p>In September 2019, the NMPA) granted marketing authorization for Tagrisso as a first-line treatment for adults with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have the genetic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitutions. The drug was approved in China in March 2017 and added to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) effective from January 2019 for the 2nd-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC.</p>
<p>While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have surgery with curative intent, recurrence is still common in early-stage disease. Historically, nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, have experienced recurrence within five years. More than a third of the world&rsquo;s lung cancer patients are in China and among those with NSCLC, around 40% have tumors with an EGFR mutation.</p>
<p>Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, Oncology Business Unit, said: &ldquo;The expedited approval of Tagrisso in China as part of a curative-intent regimen for early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer underscores the high unmet need in this setting and our commitment to improving outcomes in a country with one of the highest rates of EGFR mutations in the world. This approval reinforces the importance of EGFR testing across all stages of lung cancer, prior to treatment decisions, to ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from targeted therapies like Tagrisso and live cancer-free longer.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-14 14:13:00","China nod for Tagrisso on early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer","AstraZeneca, Tagrisso, Approval, Cancer, Lung, EGFR-mutated","China nod for Tagrisso on early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-14 14:12:36","2021-04-14 14:18:08",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/china-nod-for-tagrisso-on-early-stage-egfr-mutated-lung-cancer,,,,,,china_regulator_cnmpa_big.jpg,china_regulator_cnmpa_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Lung cancer",Pharmaceutical,Oncology,"Asia Pacific, Focus On",China,AstraZeneca,Tagrisso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>A launch event is taking place on Wednesday at the Global Diabetes Summit, which is co-hosted by the WHO and the government of Canada, with the support of the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>It is 100 years since insulin was discovered, but globally, only half of people requiring it have access to this essential medicine today because of challenging storage requirements, complex treatment protocols and high prices.</p>
<h2>Dominant players keeping prices high</h2>
<p>Because of this, the international medical humanitarian organization M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) has welcomed the launch of the Global Diabetes Compact with a clear message on increasing access.</p>
<p>MSF has stressed the need to speed up the availability of more quality-assured sources of human insulin so that everyone in need can access it, especially people in low- and middle-income countries where the most people struggle to get hold of the medicine.</p>
<p>Access to insulin is also seen as critical in the context of COVID-19, considering that people with diabetes have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death.</p>
<p>Today three insulin manufacturers &ndash; Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NOV: N), and Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) &ndash; dominate the global market and often appear to mirror each other&rsquo;s price increases.</p>
<p>MSF sees the situation as particularly disappointing given that the scientists who discovered insulin sold the patent for $1 in 1921, on the understanding that the discovery of this lifesaving medicine should be available to anyone who needed it.</p>
<h2>Skyrocketing need</h2>
<p>Helen Bygrave, chronic diseases advisor for MSF&rsquo;s Access Campaign, said: &ldquo;Millions of people around the world already lack access to insulin to control their diabetes today, and looking ahead, the global need for insulin is expected to skyrocket, largely due to the rise of type 2 diabetes in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To meet the growing global demand and ensure that this lifesaving drug is readily available to people who need it, WHO must urgently work to quality-assure more sources of insulin. We&rsquo;ve witnessed how multiple generic suppliers helped scale-up treatment for other diseases like HIV/AIDS, and now we need to see the same happen with insulin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entry of other insulin manufacturers would result in lower prices and a more stable supply of the drug, MSF argues. In 2019, the WHO launched its &lsquo;prequalification&rsquo; program to evaluate and help accelerate the quality approval of more human insulin sources beyond those from the three main manufacturers to enable countries and treatment providers to confidently procure more sources of quality-assured human insulin.</p>
<p>However, to date, no alternative manufacturers have been quality-approved to produce human insulin. WHO must urgently prioritize and accelerate the prequalification of more insulin sources to break through some of the barriers that have kept insulin out of the hands of people who desperately need it, MSF has demanded.</p>","2021-04-14 12:47:00","MSF keeps up pressure on insulin access as WHO launches Global Diabete","insulin, global, diabetes, access, Compact, people, organization, disease, world, sources, pressure, launches, Health, care, bring, hopeful, prevent, human","The World Health Organization (WHO) is hopeful that its Global Diabetes Compact will help to bring the right care to all who need it as well as boosting efforts",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-14 12:37:41","2021-04-14 14:29:00",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/msf-keeps-up-pressure-on-insulin-access-as-who-launches-global-diabetes-compact,,,,,,diabetes_general_large-1-.jpg,diabetes_general_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,Diabetes,"Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Public health",Canada,"Eli Lilly, MSF, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, World Health Organisation",Insulin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488339,,"India seeks import of COVID-19 vaccines; move to bolster domestic producers","The Indian government has decided to fast-track vaccine approvals that have already been authorized by one of four foreign drug regulators or the World Health Organization, clearing the way for the emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines amid a huge surge in infections and deaths.","<p>The Indian government has decided to fast-track vaccine approvals that have already been authorized by one of four foreign drug regulators or the World Health Organization, clearing the way for the emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines amid a huge surge in infections and deaths.</p>
<p>While the move will potentially boost the country&rsquo;s pandemic response through possible imports of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) shots, it has also opened the floodgates for domestic manufacturers, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s India correspondent.</p>
<p>India reported a record single-day rise of 184,372 new coronavirus infections pushing the total tally of cases to 13.87 million, while the active cases surpassed the 1.3 million mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The death toll increased to 172,085 with 1,027 daily new fatalities, the highest since October 18, 2020, the data updated early on April 14 showed.</p>
<p>As the battle to control the rising numbers continues, there is news that India's first mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine is going to the clinics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals has initiated the enrolment of volunteers for Phase I/II clinical trials for its mRNA vaccine candidate HGCO19, said the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), which has provided seed funding for its development.</p>
<p>The DBT said it has approved additional funding towards clinical studies of India's 'first of its kind' mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, developed by the biotechnology company. The funding has been provided under the DBT's 'Mission COVID Suraksha (cover) - The Indian COVID-19 Vaccine Development Mission'. It is being implemented by DBT's public sector undertaking Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC).</p>
<h2><strong>Biotech support</strong></h2>
<p>Renu Swarup, secretary, DBT, and chairperson, BIRAC, said at the onset of COVID-19, DBT backed many vaccine development programs, including the mRNA-based vaccine. ""A year back, this was a new technology and never used for vaccine manufacturing in India,"" she said.</p>
<p>However, believing in the potential of this technology, DBT provided seed funding to Gennova to develop this technology platform amenable to scale-up and production.</p>
<p>Gennova, in collaboration with HDT Biotech Corporation, USA, has developed the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine - HGCO19, the DBT said, adding: ""The DBT has been hand-holding Gennova right from the start.""</p>
<p>HCCOG19 is an indigenously developed vaccine on a mRNA platform. mRNA vaccines are considered safe as mRNA is non-infectious, non-integrating in nature, and degraded by standard cellular mechanisms.</p>
<p>The move augurs well for India as it could give the country another option to battle the pandemic.</p>
<h2><strong>Vaccine basket</strong></h2>
<p>The matter of augmenting the basket of vaccines available for fighting the pandemic as well as to accelerate the pace and coverage of domestic vaccination program was discussed in the 23rd meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 held on April 11, 2021.</p>
<p>After comprehensive deliberation, it was recommended that vaccines for COVID-19, which have been developed and are being manufactured in foreign countries and which have been granted emergency approval for restricted use by US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, the UK&rsquo;s MHRA, PMDA Japan or which are listed in WHO the (Emergency Use Listing) may be granted emergency use approval in India, mandating the requirement of post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial in place of conduct of local clinical trial as per the provisions prescribed under the Second Schedule of the New Drugs &amp; Clinical Trials Rules 2019.</p>
<p>In a meeting chaired by Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog, it was noted the decision will facilitate quicker access to foreign vaccines by India and would encourage imports including import of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill and finish capacity etc, which will in turn, provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability for domestic use.</p>
<p>""We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J and others...to be ready to come to India as early as possible,"" said Dr Paul, also the chairman of the National Expert Committee on Vaccine Administration.</p>
<h2><strong>Heavy demand</strong></h2>
<p>The DBT had recently informed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, that the estimated manufacturing capacity of the Serum Institute of India's (SII) Covishield is 70-100 million doses every month, while Bharat Biotech's Covaxin has a planned production capacity of 12.5 million a month (150 million doses a year).</p>
<p>The SII is in the midst of upscaling its total vaccine manufacturing capacity from 1.6 billion doses per year currently to over 2.3 billion doses of vaccines annually. It will also increase its Covishield manufacturing capacity to 100 million doses per month.</p>
<p>SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla has sought a grant of $399 million from the government to ramp up Covishield production beyond 100 million doses per month, which SII is expected to reach by the end of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other vaccine makers, including Biological E and Gennova, have sought support from the DBT to avail funds from the $119 million Covid Suraksha fund, set up by the government, to accelerate their vaccine programme. Bharat Biotech has also sought $19 million for its facilities at Hyderabad and Bengaluru.</p>
<h2><strong>More vaccines</strong></h2>
<p>Five more vaccines are expected to get approval this year. The list includes J&amp;J (Bio E), Zydus Cadila, Serum's Novavax and a nasal vaccine from Bharat Biotech. Russian-made Covid vaccine Sputnik V was also cleared for emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India.</p>
<p>Among the COVID-19 vaccine undergoing trials, Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila's ZyCov-D is in Phase III trials. The company has created an in-house manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per year and has also roped in a contract manufacturer for additional capacity of about 150 million doses per year.</p>
<p>Hyderabad-based Biological E has signed a contract-manufacturing deal for producing 600 million doses of J&amp;J's COVID-19 vaccine per year. The single-shot vaccine has already been approved in the US and the company is reportedly preparing to start its clinical trials in India.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, Indian vaccine manufacturers, including the SII, Bharat Biotech, Panacea Biotech, Sanofi's Shanta Biotech, Biological E, Hester Biosciences and Zydus Cadila, have an installed capacity to manufacture 8.2 billion doses of different vaccines per year. If required, this capacity can be tweaked to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines.</p>","2021-04-14 12:23:00","India seeks import of COVID-19 vaccines; move to bolster domestic prod","COVID-19, Vaccines, Import, Production, Domestic, Gennova, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila","India seeks import of COVID-19 vaccines; move to bolster domestic producers",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-14 12:20:33","2021-04-14 12:31:30",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/india-seeks-import-of-covid-19-vaccines-move-to-bolster-domestic-producers,,,,,,india_flag_big.jpg,india_flag_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Production",India,"Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody sintilimab significantly improved OS""</span>A total of 290 patients whose cancer had progressed following first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled.</p>
<p>Based on the primary analysis population, Tyvyt demonstrated a statistically-significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to docetaxel, meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint.</p>
<p>The median OS was 11.79 months for patients on the Tyvyt arm and 8.25 months for those on the docetaxel cohort. The median progression-free survival, as assessed by investigators, was 4.30 months versus 2.79 months, and the confirmed objective response rate was 25.5% versus 2.2%, respectively. Safety was consistent with previous studies of Tyvyt.</p>

Using a similar mode of action as ACM-001 (S-pindolol), the lead asset of Actimed, S-oxprenolol exhibits a multi-modal pharmacology that specifically targets the underlying pathophysiology of cachexia, and has demonstrated significant beneficial effects on survival, body mass and functional parameters in pre-clinical models of cancer cachexia.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial terms<a id=""publish"" class=""publish"" title=""Publish""></a>Publish of the accord</strong></h2>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Actimed will receive an upfront of $550,000 in equity investment and cash and is also eligible to receive a near-term milestone of $2.7 million and up to $123.5 million in total potential milestone payments. Actimed is also eligible to receive royalties on any future sales of S-oxprenolol.</p>
<p>Faraday gains global rights to develop and commercialize S-oxprenolol for cancer cachexia and any other indications outside of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Actimed retains global rights to S-oxprenolol in ALS, where loss of body mass and muscle wasting can impact survival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted with our agreement with Faraday for S-oxprenolol which is an important and mutually beneficial agreement for both companies,&rdquo; said Actimed chief executive Robin Bhattacherjee, adding: &ldquo;As well as providing a strong partner to continue the development of S-oxprenolol, this deal enhances our ability to speed up and further advance the development of our lead candidate ACM-001 (S-pindolol) towards Phase II clinical studies for cancer cachexia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. We are also pleased to retain rights to S-oxprenolol for ALS, an indication where patients suffer similar life-threatening muscle-wasting effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faraday CEO Steve Hill commented: &ldquo;We are pleased to partner with Actimed on S-oxprenolol as we are committed to developing and advancing therapies that will prevent and treat cardiac and skeletal muscle loss associated with multiple morbidities. S-oxprenolol is highly complementary to our existing portfolio and will further strengthen our product pipeline.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-13 15:55:00","Actimed out-licenses S-oxprenolol to Faraday Pharma","Actimed Therapeutics, S-oxprenolol, Faraday Pharma, License, Cancer cachexia","Actimed out-licenses S-oxprenolol to Faraday Pharma",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-13 15:54:19","2021-04-13 16:04:46",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/actimed-out-licenses-s-oxprenolol-to-faraday-pharma,,,,,,handshake.jpg,handshake-small-1.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Neurological, Oncology","Deals, Licensing, Research","UK, USA","Actimed Therapeutics, Faraday Pharmaceuticals",S-oxprenolol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Nevertheless, the company&rsquo;s shares dipped 2.9% to HK$178.00 by close of trading today.</p>
<p>The results were released in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2021. A supplemental biologics application (sBLA) based on these results from the RATIONALE 303 trial was accepted in March 2021 and is currently under regulatory review in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the RATIONALE 303 trial results, compared to docetaxel standard of care, tislelizumab significantly prolonged the median OS by more than five months in all patients and was able to yield a consistent OS benefit across all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status,&rdquo; said Dr Caicun Zhou, director of the Department of Oncology at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital and Director of Cancer Institute of Tongji University. &ldquo;Tislelizumab was also tolerated among these patients, with a notably lower incidence rate of Grade &ge;3 adverse events compared to docetaxel. We&rsquo;re encouraged by the promising findings presented today and hope tislelizumab could become an important treatment option for second- or third-line NSCLC patients,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>In January 2021, BeiGene and Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) entered into a collaboration and license agreement granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, and Japan. BeiGene received $650 million upfront from Novartis and is also eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion in regulatory milestones, $250 million for sales milestones, and royalties on tislelizumab sales in Novartis' territory. Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China.</p>
<h2><strong>Delivering meaningful survival benefit</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tislelizumab continues to demonstrate its potential in delivering meaningful survival benefit to patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC in both the second- and third-line setting, as shown in today&rsquo;s reported results, as well as with treatment-na&iuml;ve populations as previously reported at last year&rsquo;s ASCO and ESMO meetings,&rdquo; commented Dr Yong (Ben) Ben, chief medical officer, immuno-oncology at BeiGene. &ldquo;In addition, tislelizumab was generally well-tolerated, consistent with known risks from previously reported results across different tumor types. These encouraging results from RATIONALE 303, which supported the recently accepted sBLA in second- or third-line NSCLC in China, further suggest that tislelizumab is a potentially differentiated checkpoint inhibitor,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>Just last week, BeiGene announced approval from the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for BeiGene to begin manufacturing commercial supply of its approved anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, at its state-of-the-art biologics facility in Guangzhou, China.</p>","2021-04-13 14:13:00","BeiGene unveils new Phase III data for tislelizumab","BeiGene, Phase III, Tislelizumab, Cancer, Lung, AACR meeting, Novartis","BeiGene unveils new Phase III data for tislelizumab",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-13 14:12:34","2021-04-13 14:19:39",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/beigene-unveils-new-phase-iii-data-for-tislelizumab,,,,,,beigenebig.png,beigene-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Immuno-oncology,"AACR, Conferences, Drug Trial, Research","China, Switzerland","BeiGene, Novartis",tislelizumab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Shares in J&amp;J were more than 2% lower in pre-market trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have published a statement on the issue.</p>
<h2>'Rare and severe'</h2>
<p>Their statement reads: &ldquo;As of April 12, more than 6.8 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine have been administered in the USA. The CDC and FDA are reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets. All six cases occurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered. Usually, the anticoagulant drug heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given, the statement explains.</p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency's pharmacovigilance unit last week also started a review of thromboembolic events that might be linked to the J&amp;J vaccine.</p>
<h2>'Abundance of caution'</h2>
<p>The CDC will hold a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. The FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,&rdquo; the statement explains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is important, in part, to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statement stresses that, at present, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare, and the agencies are due to provide additional information later on Tuesday.</p>
<h2>European rollout delayed</h2>
<p>J&amp;J's Janssen arm itself issued a statement later on Tuesday, stating that it has been reviewing the blood clot cases with European health authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe,&rdquo; the statement adds.</p>","2021-04-13 13:16:00",,"blood, vaccine, cases, rare, COVID-, recommend, pausing, review, statement, clots, health, agencies, type, clot, linked, latest, prompting, Johnson, pendin","Johnson & Johnson’s jab is the latest COVID-19 vaccine to be linked to rare cases of blood clots, prompting US health agencies to recommend pausing its use pend",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-13 13:12:04","2021-04-13 18:14:40",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cdc-and-fda-recommend-pausing-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-use,,,,,,johnson_big.jpg,johnson_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Public health, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"Janssen, Johnson & Johnson","COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488323,,"Sage and Biogen shares dip on essential tremor drug’s questionable tolerability","Both companies in the CNS partnership of Sage Therapeutics (Nasdaq: SAGE) and Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) closed more than 2% lower on Monday.","<p>Both companies in the CNS partnership of Sage Therapeutics (Nasdaq: SAGE) and Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) closed more than 2% lower on Monday.</p>
<p>The US companies had reported top-line results from the Phase II KINETIC study evaluating SAGE-324 in the treatment of people with essential tremor (ET).</p>
<h2>Forced switches to lower dosages</h2>
<p>Tolerability concerns were raised by the study, which nevertheless achieved its primary endpoint as SAGE-324 showed a statistically-significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the essential tremor rating assessment scale (TETRAS) performance subscale item four upper limb tremor score on day 29.</p>
<p>This corresponded to a 36% reduction from baseline in upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving SAGE-324 compared to a 21% drop in patients receiving placebo.</p>
<p>The tolerability issue was clearly difficult for investors to ignore, albeit not disastrous for the drug&rsquo;s prospects due to the availability of lower dosages. The trial evaluated treatment of SAGE-324 at the higher end of the dose range and the daily dose could be down-titrated to 45mg or 30mg if 60mg was not well tolerated. Down-titration of dose occurred in 62% of patients who received SAGE-324 and discontinuations were noted in 38%.</p>
<p>The companies sought to focus on SAGE-324&rsquo;s impact in reducing tremor in offering their reactions.</p>
<h2>'Extraordinary unmet need'</h2>
<p>Alfred Sandrock, head of research and development at Biogen, said: &ldquo;We are encouraged by the positive results of the KINETIC Study, which indicate that SAGE-324 may provide relief in people suffering with essential tremor, a movement disorder that affects an estimated 6.4 million people &ndash; and is one of the most common movement disorders &ndash; in the USA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For people with essential tremor, uncontrollable shaking of the hands, head, voice, or legs can create difficulty eating, dressing, writing, and pursuing other day-to-day tasks. It is our hope that, in collaboration with Sage, we will be able to deliver an innovative and meaningful new treatment option for these patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodger Elble, a neurologist at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, added: &ldquo;There is an extraordinary unmet need for people suffering with essential tremor, a condition that can cause significant disability in patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only approved medicine was developed more than 50 years ago, and most medicines used for ET were developed for other conditions, and their benefits to people with ET were only discovered serendipitously. Current investigational drugs like SAGE-324, if successful, may offer potential for new treatment options for tremor management, as more than 50% of people with ET do not respond optimally to the current standard of care.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-13 12:14:00",,"tremor, essential, SAGE-, Biogen, Sage, Nasdaq, people, companies, tolerability, patients, treatment, shares, drug’s, questionable, study, closed, BIIB","Both companies in the CNS partnership of Sage Therapeutics (Nasdaq: SAGE) and Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) closed more than 2% lower on Monday.",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-13 11:34:22","2021-04-13 12:15:41",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sage-and-biogen-shares-dip-on-essential-tremor-drug-s-questionable-tolerability,,,,,,sage-large.jpg,sage-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Drug Trial, Research",USA,"Biogen, Sage Therapeutics",SAGE-324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>This is the first drug of such kind produced in Russia. It is known as ANB-4, and the company has been working on its development since the beginning of 2018. The drug has previously shown its efficiency in animals with SMA, and the company is now conducting its clinical and pre-clinical trials already in the short-term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an official spokesman of Biocad said in an interview with Forbes Russia magazine, pre-clinical studies of the drug have already begun, while their task was to clarify the optimal dosage of the drug and study its possible toxicity.</p>
<p>The company plans to complete pre-clinical trials of the drug this year, after which its clinical trials will begin.</p>
<p>Most of these trials be carried out in children with type 1 SMA, which is the most severe form of the disease. Half of these children do not live more than10 months, and another 25% die before 13.6 months. The proportion of patients with type 1 SMA is about 60%. It is planned to include children under 6 months of age in clinical trials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using a viral vector, we add the SMN1 gene to cells where it was previously damaged, thereby saving cells from death for many years and preventing the development of SMA,&rdquo; explains Dmitry Madera, head of the ANB-4 Biocad&rsquo;s development team.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Biocad&rsquo;s drug to be cheaper than existing therapies</strong></h2>
<p>The company predicts that its new drug will be cheaper than existing analogues, but does not name its approximate price.</p>
<p>There are few drugs available for treating SMA in the market. The first was the Spinraza (nusinersen) from the American company Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB). The cost of the first year of the therapy with the drug is about 45 million roubles ($579,000), while for the second year and subsequent years it is 20 million roubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, another drug is Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) from Novartis (NOVN: VX). The drug has recently appeared in the market and has already been approved in several countries, being priced at $2.125 million. This is the most expensive drug in the world, which because of its price, got into the Guinness Book of Records. A single application is enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a drug called Evrisdi (risdiplam) from the Swiss pharma giant Roche. Only Spinraza and Evrisdi are registered in Russia.</p>
<p>With regard to Biocad, the company has given no indication about the planned launch of its drug.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Path to market approval</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysts, the entire path from the creation of a drug molecule to its registration on the market usually takes five to 10 years, and can be interrupted at any stage: of all substances involved in preclinical development and studies, only 2% become registered drugs. The rest are not effective enough or cause too severe side effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, registration process can be carried out according to an accelerated scheme, and also, given the severity of the disease and the patient population, for ethical reasons, the first phase of the clinical trial can be combined with the second, which will also speed up the process of bringing the drug to the market.</p>","2021-04-13 11:52:00","Russia’s Biocad to compete with Biogen a,nd Roche with new drug for SM","Biocad, Development, ANB-4, Muscular atrophy, Spinal, Biogen, Roche, Novartis, Evrisdi, Spinraza, Zolgensma, SMA","Russia’s Biocad to compete with Biogen and Roche with new drug for SMARussia’s Biocad to compete with Biogen and Roche with new drug for SMA",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-13 11:50:15","2021-04-13 12:15:57",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-biocad-to-compete-with-biogen-and-roche-with-new-drug-for-sma,,,,,,biocad_large.jpg,biocad_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Spinal muscular atrophy",Pharmaceutical,"Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Rare diseases","Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Regulation, Research, Russian market",Russia,"Biocad, Biogen, Novartis, Roche","ANB-4, Risdiplam, Spinraza, Zolgensma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Takeda&rsquo;s (TYO: 4502) Takhzyro (lanadelumab) and two C1 esterase inhibitors, the Japanese drugmaker&rsquo;s Cinryze along with CSL Behring&rsquo;s Haegarda, are the three treatments that are subject to the ICER pilot incorporating more than 24 months of observational real-world demographic, utilization, and cost data to further clarify the therapies&rsquo; value.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""We hope to use observational RWE from the Aetion Evidence Platform to help close information gaps""</span>The ICER&rsquo;s updated assessment will leverage observational data analyzed by the RWE start-up Aetion, as part of the ongoing collaboration between the two organizations, and consistent with ICER&rsquo;s commitment to expand use of RWE to complement other sources of information used in its value assessments.</p>
<p>In addition to this specific pilot to use RWE to update ICER assessments completed more than 24 months ago, Aetion has analyzed RWE to support earlier assessment of treatments for sickle cell disease.</p>
<p>Jon Campbell, the ICER&rsquo;s senior vice president of health economics, said: &ldquo;As ICER noted throughout our earlier assessment of these HAE therapies, our economic models were very sensitive to small changes in assumptions about the frequency of attacks, the amount of on-demand treatment required, and the exact dosing regimens of prophylactic therapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years later, we hope to use observational RWE from the Aetion Evidence Platform to help close some of these information gaps. By defining the baseline demographics and utilization characteristics of patients who start HAE prophylaxis, evaluating HAE attack rates before initiation of prophylaxis, and updating our health cost assumptions accordingly, ICER aims to further clarify the overall value of these HAE therapies in real-world settings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We appreciate Aetion&rsquo;s continued partnership as we work together to set new standards for how decision-grade RWE can be appropriately applied alongside high-quality clinical trial data to better inform the consequential decisions that biopharma manufacturers, insurers, and other stakeholders make every single day around drug pricing and patient access.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carolyn Magill, chief executive of Aetion, added: &ldquo;Pilots like this will help inform efforts of HTA organizations around the world in their quest to evaluate how and when to base their decisions on RWE, while advancing how we as a health care industry - and a society - determine value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of this pilot, the ICER has engaged clinical experts and the manufacturers of these HAE therapies, and each manufacturer was provided several weeks to respond to ICER&rsquo;s data request and comment on the proposed approach.</p>
<p>The ICER will be proceeding with a condensed timeline for incorporating RWE into this re-assessment, and expects to publish its RWE update on July 27, 2021.</p>","2021-04-12 15:53:00",,"ICER, assessment, observational, therapies, evidence, Aetion, real-world, update, prophylaxis, clinical, attacks, economic, ICERs, data, information, drugs","The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has announced that it is using observational real-world evidence (RWE) to update its 2018 assessment of th",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-12 15:22:20","2021-04-12 15:57:42",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-to-incorporate-rwe-into-assessment-of-hae-drugs,,,,,,medicines_money_stock_large.jpg,medicines_money_stock_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Genetics, Rare diseases","Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access",USA,"CSL Behring, Takeda","Cinryze, Haegarda, Takhzyro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>President Biden proposed huge increases for many federal research agencies as part of a $118 billion boost in domestic spending.</p>
<p>As Joe Biden's first budget request to Congress as President, it offers a look at his priorities on healthcare and education, with increases in discretionary - or optional spending - across the board. A proposal detailing mandatory spending requests - which includes Medicaid and Medicare - will come later, said White House officials.</p>
<h2><strong>$6.5 billion requested to set up ARPA-H</strong></h2>
<p>Within the totality of the requests, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would grow by $9 billion to $51 billion. That total includes $6.5 billion for a new entity, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health (ARPA-H), that would initially focus on research into cancer and other diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer&rsquo;s. The APRA-H&rsquo;s aims would be to &ldquo;drive transformational innovation in health research and speed applications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the agency is established, it could mark a fundamental shift in how the US government funds research, steering the emphasis from basic science to higher-risk projects more directly aimed at major medical breakthroughs, observers have noted.</p>
<p>President Biden called for a $1.6 billion funding increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - a boost that represents almost a quarter of the agency&rsquo;s current budget - to help increase core public health capacity at the federal and state level. The money could also be used to help build out public health data infrastructure and train new public health experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would get a big boost to both its research and industrial programs. Spending on NIST&rsquo;s research labs would grow by $124 million, to $916 million, and its investment in a network of manufacturing institutes would more than double, to $442 million.</p>","2021-04-12 15:00:00","US President’s discretionary funding request includes new research age","US President, Joe Biden, Discretionary, Funding request,  Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA-H, CDC, NIH","US President’s discretionary funding request includes new research agency",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-12 14:59:30","2021-04-12 15:07:33",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-president-s-discretionary-funding-request-includes-new-research-agency,,,,,,biden_big.jpg,biden_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"CNS Diseases, Diabetes, Oncology","Biden administration, Financial, Government Affairs, Regulation, Research",USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The trial did not achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint of prevention measuring organ dysfunction and all-cause mortality, and the primary endpoint of recovery measuring a change in clinical status (from early recovery to death), at 30 days. The study was conducted in partnership with Saint Luke&rsquo;s Mid America Heart Institute.</p>
<p>DARE-19 was the first Phase III trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who also have risk factors for developing serious complications, including hypertension (HTN), type-2 diabetes (T2D), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 3-4. Cardiac, renal and metabolic co-morbidities have been associated with poor outcomes and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
<h2><strong>Also trialing AZD7442</strong></h2>
<p>AstraZeneca is also trialing AZD7442, a long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination which is in late-stage development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The company last month signed a deal with the US government to supply up to <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/astrazeneca-inks-new-205-million-deal-with-us-govt-for-covid-19-antibody-azd7442"">500,000 additional doses of AZD7442</a>, worth $205 million.</p>
<p>Dr Mikhail Kosiborod, cardiologist at Saint Luke&rsquo;s Mid America Heart Institute, vice president of research at Saint Luke's Health System, and principal investigator of DARE-19, said: &ldquo;DARE-19 provided important data on the potential benefits and risks of using SGLT2 inhibitors to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While the trial did not achieve statistical significance, the findings are very interesting and valuable, and will inform future clinical science.

<p>Under the terms of the accord, which is worth up to 414 million euros ($492 million), C4XD will receive an upfront payment of 7 million euros and could receive up to a further 407 million euros in potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, of which 11 million euros is in pre-clinical milestones, in addition to single digit royalties.</p>
<p>Under the license, Sanofi will develop and commercialize an oral therapy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, a multi-billion-dollar market. The IL-17 family of cytokines are strong inducers of inflammation and are implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Current treatments targeting IL-17 are monoclonal antibodies administered via an injection. There is an urgent need for safe and efficacious oral small molecule therapies to increase the number of patients able to access IL-17 targeted drugs and expand availability into new inflammatory disease indications.</p>
<h2><strong>Can selectively block IL-17 activity</strong></h2>
<p>C4XD&rsquo;s small molecule IL-17A inhibitor program can selectively block IL-17 activity in vivo whilst maintaining molecular size of the molecule in the traditional ""drug-like"" range suitable for oral administration. Sanofi will continue to work with the C4XD team to access its unique and proprietary 4D Conformetrix technology, as the program advances towards clinical studies.</p>
<p>C4X Discovery chief executive Clive Dix commented: &ldquo;We are proud to be working with Sanofi to create much needed oral therapies in the underserved inflammatory disease space. While antibody therapies have demonstrated the potential of IL-17 inhibition in the generation of highly effective treatments, the injectable route means many patients currently do not have access to the medicines that can change their lives. We believe that our small molecule program has the potential to create high value, efficacious and convenient oral IL-17 therapeutics for this large market. The psoriasis market alone is estimated to be worth ~$24 billion per annum by 2027, and when combined with Sanofi&rsquo;s development expertise our program has the potential to address a number of indications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;This is the second significant agreement for a C4XD program and marks a major milestone for the company, not only validating the strength of our drug discovery expertise, but also our strategy to drive shareholder value through early-stage revenue generating deals. With Indivior progressing our molecule for opioid addiction through a Phase I clinical trial and now our partnership with Sanofi driving potential next generation oral IL-17 therapies, we look forward with confidence to</p>

488306,,"PhRMA comments on NIST in effort to safeguard IP protections","Last week, trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) submitted comments to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) regarding the proposed rulemaking on implementing regulations of the Bayh-Dole Act.","<p>Last week, trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) submitted comments to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) regarding the proposed rulemaking on implementing regulations of the Bayh-Dole Act.</p>
<p>Passed in 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act was a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that established a uniform framework across the federal government to encourage technology transfer between universities and the private sector that has facilitated timely and efficient commercialization of early-stage research. Since its passage, it has fueled unprecedented innovation across the USA, noted Megan Van Etten, a senior director of public affairs at PhRMA.</p>
<p>In the comments, PhRMA outlines why providing certainty when it comes to intellectual property (IP) protections in the USA is in the best interest of innovators everywhere. Below are five key excerpts from the comments highlighting the critical role IP plays in continued innovation in biopharmaceutical research, development and manufacturing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP rights are an essential link in the chain when it comes to the biopharmaceutical industry&rsquo;s ability to innovate and develop new treatments and cures</strong>. &ldquo;Collectively, clear IP ownership by the grantee along with the certainty of exclusive licensing terms established under the Bayh-Dole Act have helped foster licensing of technology resulting from federal funding for use by private sector entities to advance biomedical research. We believe the proposed changes to the implementing regulations of Bayh-Dole help maintain the balance of rights between innovators, contractors, licensees, and the federal agencies that contribute funding for early-stage research.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Robust IP protections allow for continued innovation and job creation in the USA</strong>. &ldquo;Strong and predictable intellectual property (IP) protections in the USA are essential to the USA&rsquo;s</li>
<li>economic well-being, and signal to other jurisdictions the critically important economic benefits of IP. The substantial investments related to biopharmaceutical R&amp;D also fuel the US economy. IP-intensive manufacturing industries drive economic progress and collectively support 57.6 million American jobs and the biopharmaceutical industry supports a total of more than 4.7 million jobs, contributing $1.3 trillion in economic output when direct and indirect effects are considered.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>The proposed rulemaking process reaffirms the importance of balancing the rights of all stakeholders. </strong>&ldquo;PhRMA supports NIST&rsquo;s efforts to improve certainty afforded to stakeholders regarding the use of march-in rights and the process for exercising march-in rights by its proposed changes to 37 C.F.R. &sect; 401.6. As discussed further below, such changes (1) clarify the statutory bases for initiating march-in proceedings, (2) codify the &ldquo;informal consultation&rdquo; process when a funding agency is considering the exercise of march-in proceedings, and (3) amend the timeline for the agency deliberation period.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>NIST confirms that Bayh-Dole does not provide for price to be the basis for exercising march-in rights.</strong> &ldquo;NIST&rsquo;s articulation of the lack of statutory basis to exercising march-in rights on the basis of pricing decisions helpfully provides clarity and certainty to stakeholders. Indeed, the statute provides authority for a Federal agency to exercise march-in rights when it determines action is needed for a list of specific reasons that notably does not include pricing decisions.&rdquo;</li>

<p>In COVID-19 related news last week, Japan&rsquo;s Takeda and Australia&rsquo;s CSL Ltd reported that the project they are leading, dubbed CoVig-19 Plasma Alliance, had failed to meet Phase III goals, and is therefore concluded. AstraZeneca&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine, now called Vaxzevria, came under the spotlight last week regarding possible links to blood clots. On the regulatory front, Acadia Pharmaceuticals had a setback, as the US Food and Drug Administration issued a complete response letter (CRL) relating to its supplementary Biologics License (sBLA) for Nuplazid as a treatment for dementia-related psychosis. FibroGen revealed that some false data had been presented on its drug candidate roxadustat for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-associated anemia. Also, Provention Bio revealed problems with its regulatory filing for diabetes candidate teplizumab.</p>
<h2><strong>Takeda, CSL Behring fold big plasma alliance after Ph III flop</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/covig-19-plasma-alliance-s-immunoglobulin-trial-misses-goals"">big plasma alliance</a> spearheaded by Takeda and CSL Behring has a big Phase III verdict: Adding their hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin product to Gilead&rsquo;s remdesivir does not stall disease progression, commented Amber Tong on EndPoints News.</p>
<p>Dubbed CoVig, the treatment was supposed to be a higher-grade version of convalescent plasma, which former President Donald Trump once hailed as a &ldquo;historic breakthrough.&rdquo; But it seems to be following plasma down the same path toward obsolescence. Coming a year after the companies announced the partnership - which they called a bold move to find answers amid uncertainty - the failure would mark an end to their work, which had included manufacturing the product at-risk.</p>
<p>The hospitalized patient population has been an elusive group for antibodies, defeating a slew of candidates from Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline/Vir and Brii Bio.</p>
<p>Plasma from healthy donors who have recovered from Covid-19, meanwhile, has also had trouble living up to early expectations. The UK&rsquo;s RECOVERY trial stopped recruiting patients for its convalescent plasma arm after an independent data monitoring committee found no significant improvement in mortality.</p>
<h2><strong>AstraZeneca needs to regain public trust on COVID-19 vaccine</strong></h2>
<p>Following the news that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has confirmed a possible link between very rare cases of <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-finds-possible-link-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-with-rare-blood-clots"">unusual blood clots</a> after vaccination with AstraZeneca&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria, analytics firm GlobalData&rsquo;s senior pharma analyst Philipp Rosenbaum said that &ldquo;AstraZeneca has had its fair share of bad luck with its COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria, but a lack of communication in combination with uncoordinated and confusing decisions about who should get the vaccine from European politics has eroded the public trust in the vaccine. Now a clear message must be sent from European regulators and politicians and the company, that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risk of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>Moreover, the UK has now joined several EU countries in recommending Vaxzevria only to people below certain ages. However, with variants such as B.117 spreading rapidly through Europe, slowing the outbreak and reducing new COVID-19 cases will depend heavily on vaccination efforts; thus, continuation of existing vaccination programs is urgently needed to prevent more cases and deaths in vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>However, Dr Rosenbaum said, in the long-term, having alternatives such as the mRNA vaccines and single dose vaccines, means that AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Vaxzevria will potentially only play a small role post-pandemic if repeat vaccinations for COVID-19 are needed. There will be enough alternatives, and countries with the needed resources might shift towards vaccines with better efficacy and safety data. In fact, the US is already donating stock of its AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico and Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccine will continue to play a significant role in the global fight against the pandemic, given that AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India, are planning to manufacture and distribute more than two billion doses of the vaccine at a low cost globally. However, the company and politicians must make sure that Vaxzevria will not been seen as the vaccine that can be distributed globally, while the US and European countries are trying to count on mRNA vaccines, possibly creating a two-class vaccine system,&rdquo; he concluded</p>
<h2><strong>CRL for Acadia, as expected: FDA changed its mind</strong></h2>
<p>Acadia received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/acadia-to-take-issue-with-fda-over-crl-for-nuplazid-sbla"">Nuplazid&rsquo;s sNDA filing</a> in dementia-related psychosis (DRP), which is not surprising given that on March 3 the FDA informed the company that it had identified deficiencies during the review, noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Mark Goodman. Management indicated that this is the first time that the FDA raised concerns about the HARMONY trial (Study 045) design and data analysis, as the CRL cited &ldquo;a lack of statistical significance in some of the subgroups of dementia, and insufficient numbers of patients with certain less common dementia subtypes as lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness to support approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is clearly disappointing news, as the criteria mentioned in the CRL were not among any of the prespecified requirements that were agreed upon previously with the FDA. It appears that the FDA has changed its mind with new leadership for the psychiatry division, and it&rsquo;s not clear what the FDA would need to see to approve a product for this indication. Acadia still believes it has robust clinical data based on its original agreed upon pivotal study design targeting a broad DRP population, and it plans to schedule a type A meeting with the FDA to defend its position and determine next steps. However, we think the likelihood of a reversal by the FDA is very low, and we assume that Acadia will need to do another study in DRP, which would delay a launch by several years.</p>
<p>Management believes that it has demonstrated robust efficacy results from both the open-label phase and the randomized withdrawal phase with the pre-specified criteria, and it should be adequate to satisfy the FDA&rsquo;s requirements from the End-of-Phase 2 meeting that &ldquo;to rely on a single well-controlled study for your sNDA filing, the findings must be very persuasive&rdquo;, which means &ldquo; statistically significant with a very small probability of Type I error and a finding that is clinically meaningful.</p>
<p>Also commenting of Evaluate Vantage, Madeleine Armstrong noted that fears are growing that the US regulator is becoming strict, and several examples of the agency playing hardball have been seen in 2021, the latest being Acadia.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is no bad thing. The FDA should not approve drugs without clear evidence of their efficacy and safety, and is arguably just doing its job by setting a high bar here.</p>
<p>But Acadia is clearly aggrieved at what it believes were shifting goalposts. The Nuplazid CRL itself was not a surprise after the agency said last month that it had identified deficiencies in its filing; the surprise was that the FDA found fault with Acadia&rsquo;s Phase III trial, HARMONY &ndash; apparently changing&nbsp;its mind about this trial&rsquo;s design. This could be a worrying development for other biopharma groups, Ms Armstrong warned. Nerves will be jangling at other groups with questionable datasets and big approval decisions coming up. Biogen springs to mind.</p>
<h2><strong>FibroGen stretches the bounds of credibility</strong></h2>
<p>Fibrogen&rsquo;s claim that its anemia pill <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fibrogen-admits-false-safety-data-used-for-roxadustat"">roxadustat was safer than infused EPO agents</a>, for certain patients on dialysis, formed a big part the project&rsquo;s perceived value, according to Amy Brown writing on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>That value, already diminished by the company&rsquo;s opaque disclosure of complex datasets, was seriously dented again last Tuesday. Fibrogen&rsquo;s staggering admission of major data errors in previous presentations leaves roxadustat looking like a considerably weaker proposition. A hard line from regulators cannot be ruled out, even before considering what doctors will make of all this.</p>
<p>The mistake concerns pooled <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/trial-results/roxadustat-moves-regulators"">safety data first presented back in 2019</a>at the American Society of Nephrology on roxadustat, which is being developed to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. At the time the company claimed that the findings cleared up doubt about Roxadustat&rsquo;s safety profile in two distinct kidney disease populations &ndash; those dependent on dialysis and pre-dialysis patients &ndash; although many remained unconvinced.</p>
<p>Those doubters will now feel. FibroGen revealed that the disclosed data had been adjusted post hoc for various stratification factors. On a pre-specified basis, on which regulatory decisions will be made, roxadustat&rsquo;s safety edge narrows in both populations.</p>
<p>Last month, in <a href=""http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001x7F-Qzud23_EploB0BjfRiuxupAkFb7zgcAU5XeosPnnwlKJhqdu69HU6AKZtK73OZyguvkbZUi3oJzmmzx1_R2bYHZrSc19VSq1jWPFJY10zW2pQpHDr0WCz0x53bPE2vf3Vnu5BAtQHjFcZJGklucKdM0Uh8Ewr5y9Q76LUHaU_IXS7qpr3i9smj7Yh8rdBUVX1d1L4mz9yQCUFGdS_8CYsn7t20Id8orfgq5MSSi5f9xoT7vZhJTE7tUu6M__8ZHBCVc9jAZnwoBgxtTckQF0a-BM3IAz&amp;c=Y0-rInX5HO8RWy6P0voDDsif8BThCsc-4XyaDpDUVUZnyTLC7FeDoA==&amp;ch=YSe8X-sz_Uriq2PZf9SUrfSj4HHnd5kCLRWYdNLTnj_zz_E_u4hLvQ==""><strong>ICER's assessment of roxadustat</strong></a>, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review voiced similar concerns around the treatment's cardiovascular safety data. ICER's chief medical officer Dr David Rind explained why the ICER&rsquo;s independent appraisal committee, CTAF, voted unanimously (15-0) that the evidence is not adequate to show that roxadustat provides a net health benefit over usual care:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The effect of roxadustat on cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality is of particular concern. The drug maker has conducted multiple trials examining this issue, but although these trials ended several years ago, the company has not yet made public a number of analyses that we feel are necessary to answer several key questions. This leaves large uncertainties about the balance of risks and benefits of roxadustat, and the votes of the CTAF panel confirmed these concerns. I think it's safe to assume these questions will be a focus of FDA&rsquo;s July 15 AdCom meeting,&rdquo; said Dr Rind.</p>
<h2><strong>Trouble brewing for Provention?</strong></h2>
<p>Provention Bio licensed the old Eli Lilly drug teplizumab a few years ago, hoping to bring the experimental drug back from the dead in type 1 diabetes after it flamed out in a pivotal diabetes study undertaken by the Big Pharma more than 10 years ago. But Provention is seeing <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/market-frets-over-deficiencies-in-teplizumab-submission"">troubled waters ahead following new feedback</a> from the FDA last week, according to Max Gelman writing on EndPoints News.</p>
<p>The biotech revealed Thursday that regulators expressed concerns over the candidate&rsquo;s pharmacokinetics data and comparability to when Lilly first put teplizumab into clinical trials. Regulators are asserting the PK profiles from Provention&rsquo;s studies and Lilly&rsquo;s trials are not the same and asked for more data on April 2.</p>
<p>In an ominous sign, regulators have said that such concerns mean it is not ready to start post-marketing and label discussions, per Provention&rsquo;s accounting of the feedback. Such comments are eerily similar to Acadia&rsquo;s dementia program, which received a CRL just last week.</p>","2021-04-11 10:48:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 9, 2021","News review, COVID-19, Takeda, CSL Ltd, CoVig-19, AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Acadia Pharma, Nuplazid, FibroGen, Roxadustat, Provention Bio, Teplizumab","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 9, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-11 10:43:20","2021-04-11 11:05:12",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-9-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","CNS Diseases, Diabetes, Infectious diseases, Nephrology and Hepatology, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, CSL Ltd, FibroGen, Provention Bio, Takeda","Nuplazid, roxadustat, teplizumab, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The new technology platform will expand Sanofi&rsquo;s research capabilities in both immuno-oncology and inflammatory diseases, while likely having broad applicability to other disease areas as well.</p>
<p>Sanofi acquired Tidal Therapeutics, which was formed in 2019 and spun out from LabCentral, for an upfront payment of $160 million and up to $310 million on the achievement of certain milestones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We anticipate that this next generation, off-the-shelf approach has the potential to bring CAR-T cell therapy to a much broader patient population,&rdquo; said Frank Nestle, global head of research and chief scientific officer at Sanofi, adding<em>:</em> &ldquo;We believe that the underlying mRNA targeting platform will create disruptive therapeutic approaches across a variety of oncology and autoimmune conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Tidal technology</strong></h2>
<p>Tidal Therapeutics&rsquo; technology is based on proprietary nanoparticles that deliver mRNA (messages) to reprogram immune cells inside the body. The technology delivers mRNA cargos selectively to designated types of cells in the body, with initial applications targeting specific types of immune cells.</p>
<p>The <em>in vivo</em> approach is designed to provide similar efficacy to current <em>ex vivo </em>approaches where immune cells are genetically modified to enhance their therapeutic properties (such as chimeric antigen receptor [CAR]-expressing T-cells), with the potential for improved safety, outpatient dosing, and repeat dosing. Currently, Tidal Therapeutics has ongoing pre-clinical programs including <em>in vivo </em>re-programming of T cells or other types of immune cells for cancer indications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teaming up with Sanofi gives us the opportunity to further develop our unique platform and rapidly apply it to ultimately help patients across a range of diseases,&rdquo; said Ulrik Nielsen, president and chief executive of Tidal Therapeutics.</p>
<p>The announcement came on the same day that Sanofi completed its acquisition of Kymab, for which is paid $1.1 billion upfront with $300 million contingent. With the deal, Sanofi acquires Kymab&rsquo;s KY1005, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to OX40-Ligand, which has the potential for a broad range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders.</p>","2021-04-10 15:59:00","Sanofi snaps up US biotech to expand I-O portfolio","Sanofi, Tidal Therapeutics, Acquisition, M&A, Immuno-oncology, Inflammatory diseases","Sanofi snaps up US biotech to expand I-O portfolio",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-10 15:56:38","2021-04-10 16:05:18",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-snaps-up-us-biotech-to-expand-i-o-portfolio,,,,,,2020_sanofi_big.jpg,2020_sanofi_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Immuno-oncology, Inflammatory diseases","Companies, mergers and acquisitions","France, USA","Sanofi, Tidal Therapeutics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Gedatolisib is in clinical development for the treatment of patients with ER+/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<h2>Deal worth up to $340 million</h2>
<p>The Minneapolis-based company paid an upfront license fee of $5 million in cash and the same amount again of its common stock as upfront payment.</p>
<p>Pfizer is eligible to receive up to $330 million of development and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties on potential sales. Additional financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Brian Sullivan, chief executive of Celcuity, said: &ldquo;We are excited about the opportunity to utilize our CELsignia platform to support the development of a potential first-in-class targeted therapy like gedatolisib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In light of the important role the PI3K/mTOR pathway plays in driving tumor growth when patients become resistant to endocrine therapies, we believe gedatolisib is a highly promising drug candidate to improve outcomes for patients with breast cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supporting development of a potential first-in-class therapy for breast cancer, such as gedatolisib, with our CELsignia platform is a natural extension of our strategy to develop CELsignia CDx for other breast cancer therapies. We believe developing targeted therapies that benefit from the CELsignia platform while also offering companion diagnostics that enable new drug indications, creates a synergistic advantage for each program.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Trial results send stock value skywards</h2>
<p>Gedatolisib is currently being evaluated in combination with palbociclib, an oral CDK 4/6 inhibitor, and either letrozole or fulvestrant in the expansion portion of a Phase Ib clinical trial in patients with ER+/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>Results from the trial were announced late on Thursday, and Celcuity's shares were up by more than 40% at the mid-point of Friday's trading.</p>
<p>A total of 103 patients were enrolled in one of four different arms according to their prior treatment history for metastatic breast cancer. A preliminary analysis of the objective response rates as of the January 11, 2021 data cut-off demonstrated that gedatolisib combined with palbociclib and an endocrine therapy achieved superior objective response rates relative to historical control data.

<p>In a statement, the firm said the US Food and Drug Administration had ""identified deficiencies"" in an ongoing review of the firm&rsquo;s Biologic License Application (BLA) for teplizumab.</p>
<p>While these deficiencies would &ldquo;preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments at this time,&rdquo; they do not indicate a final negative decision from the US regulator.</p>
<p>The FDA also had bad news for Provention in relation to its single, low-dose bridging study, which compares the firm&rsquo;s planned drug product, manufactured by AGC Biologics, with the drug substance use in its trial program, which is manufactured by Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).</p>
<p>The agency stated that, based on the data it has reviewed to date, it did not view the pharmacokinetic profiles of the two drug products as being comparable, and that additional data would be required.</p>
<p>These issues would be discussed concurrently with its ongoing review, the FDA said.</p>
<h2>Bumpy road</h2>
<p>Formerly under development by fellow US biotech MacroGenics (Nasdaq: MGNX), work on teplizumab was stopped in 2010 after a clinical trial run with partner Eli Lilly failed to show a slowing in the progression of diabetes.</p>
<p>Provention acquired all rights to the compound under the terms of a deal agreed in 2018, which also included licensing rights to MGD010, seen as a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p>
<p>Given the burden associated with type 1 diabetes, analysts have estimated a course of treatment could be priced at around $100,000, on which basis teplizumab would secure blockbuster status if it achieves the expected level of market penetration.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent regulatory setback, chief executive Ashleigh Palmer said the FDA's initial feedback &ldquo;will likely result in a delay in timelines&rdquo; for the potential approval of teplizumab in type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;We believe in the comparability of the drug product produced by our partner AGC biologics with Eli Lilly manufactured product,&rdquo; adding: &ldquo;We look forward to working closely with the agency to address its additional data requirement, so we can deliver teplizumab to patients as soon as possible.""</p>","2021-04-09 16:40:00",,"teplizumab, diabetes, drug, Provention, deficiencies, firm, setback, regulatory, market, frets, submission, reported, Friday, related, trading, fell, Stock","Stock in Provention Bio fell 35% ahead of trading on Friday, after the firm reported a regulatory setback related to its novel diabetes med teplizumab.",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-09 14:13:10","2021-04-09 18:30:04",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/market-frets-over-deficiencies-in-teplizumab-submission,,,,,,provention-bio-large.jpg,provention-bio-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Diabetes,"Drug Trial, Regulation, Research, US FDA",USA,"Provention Bio",teplizumab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The ICOD project, developed in collaboration with the Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions M&egrave;diques (IMIM) in Barcelona, will involve five clinical centers in France, Spain and Italy.</p>
<h2>'New approach to treat cognitive deficits'</h2>
<p>It will support the initial clinical development of AEF0217, from Phase I studies in healthy volunteers in 2021, to a Phase II proof-of-concept study of efficacy in individuals with Down syndrome, in 2023. The overarching goal of the project is to make AEF0217 available to the Down syndrome community six to seven years from now.</p>
<p>AEF0217 provides a new approach to treat cognitive deficits. It is a signaling specific inhibitor of the CB1 receptor (CB1-SSi), the primary receptor of the endocannabinoid system, responsible for the regulation of a large number of behavioral and cognitive processes. Recent studies have shown that cognitive disorders related to Down Syndrome involve hyperactivation of the CB1 receptor.</p>
<p>CB1-SSi represents a new pharmacological class, discovered by Pier Vincenzo Piazza, AELIS FARMA&rsquo;s chief executive, during his tenure as director of the Neurocenter Magendie of INSERM in Bordeaux. These compounds selectively inhibit a pathological hyperactivation of the CB1 receptor without modifying its normal physiological activity.</p>
<h2>'One of the most thorough evaluations of preclinical efficacy in Down syndrome'</h2>
<p>AEF0217 has received one of the most thorough evaluations of pre-clinical efficacy in the field of Down syndrome. Using a recently validated translational approach, these studies have shown that AEF0217 completely reverses cognitive deficits in adult trisomic animals.</p>
<p>Because of its unique mechanism of action and preclinical efficacy, AEF0217 has the potential to significantly improve the cognitive abilities of individuals with Down Syndrome, without producing significant side effects.</p>
<p>Dr Piazza said: &ldquo;We are very proud to have been awarded this grant and very pleased by the outstanding positive evaluation it has received. After the Seal of Excellence received last year, the award of the ICOD project provides a full validation by the EC of the innovative therapeutic approach developed by AELIS FARMA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down syndrome, like many neuro-developmental disorders, is a real burden for the individuals and their families. At AELIS FARMA, we are very excited to try and contribute to alleviate this suffering by increasing the autonomy of subjects with Down syndrome and their social insertion.""</p>","2021-04-09 16:32:00",,"syndrome, project, cognitive, AELIS, million, ICOD, disorders, development, FARMA, grant, treatment, deficits, receptor, euros, efficacy, approach, drug","AELIS FARMA, a privately-held French biotech specializing in the treatment of brain disorders, has announced a boost for the Improving Cognition in Down Syndrom",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-09 16:24:42","2021-04-09 16:57:11",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/down-syndrome-drug-development-given-six-million-euros-ec-grant,,,,,,euro_euros_money_finance_big.jpg,euro_euros_money_finance_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"European Commission",Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Business Financing, Research",France,"Aelis Farma",AEF0217,,,,"Down syndrome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<h2><strong>PRAC investigating thromboembolic events with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen</strong></h2>
<p>The PRAC has started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of thromboembolic events (formation of blood clots, resulting in the obstruction of a vessel) in people who received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, developed by US healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) Janssen unit.</p>
<p>Four serious cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets have been reported post-vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. One case occurred in a clinical trial and three cases occurred during the vaccine rollout in the USA. One of them was fatal.</p>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is currently only used in the USA, under an emergency use authorization. It was authorized in the European Union on March 11, 2021. The vaccine rollout has not started yet in any EU member state but is expected in the next few weeks. These reports point to a &lsquo;safety signal&rsquo;, but it is currently not clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and these conditions. The PRAC is investigating these cases and will decide whether regulatory action may be necessary, which usually consists of an update to the product information.</p>
<h2>PRAC reviews signal of capillary leak syndrome with Vaxzevria</h2>
<p>The PRAC has also started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of capillary leak syndrome in people who were vaccinated with Vaxzevria from UK pharma major AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN).</p>
<p>Five cases of this very rare disorder, characterized by leakage of fluid from blood vessels causing tissue swelling and a drop in blood pressure, were reported in the EudraVigilance database.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination and the reports of capillary leak syndrome. These reports point to a &lsquo;safety signal&rsquo; - information on new or changed adverse events that may potentially be associated with a medicine and that warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>The PRAC will evaluate all the available data to decide if a causal relationship is confirmed or not. In cases where a causal relationship is confirmed or considered likely, regulatory action is necessary in order to minimize the risk. This usually takes the form of an update of the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.</p>
<p>The EMA will further communicate once the evaluations have concluded on both vaccines.</p>","2021-04-09 15:14:00","EMA/PRAC investigating safety of more COVID-19 vaccines","EMA, PRAC, Pharmacovigilance, Investigation, COVID-19, Vaccines, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Blood clots, Capillary leak","EMA/PRAC investigating safety of more COVID-19 vaccines",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-09 15:11:42","2021-04-09 15:25:28",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-prac-investigating-safety-of-more-covid-19-vaccines,,,,,,covid_big.jpg,covid_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"COVID-19 vaccines",Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Public health, Regulation","Europe, UK, USA","AstraZeneca, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson","COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, Vaxzevria",,,,,,"European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Committee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Opdivo plus chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful benefit for the primary and secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and in the all-randomized patient population at the pre-specified interim analysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, Opdivo plus chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.</p>
<h2>Yervoy combination misses one primary endpoint</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Opdivo plus Yervoy also met primary and secondary endpoints by demonstrating statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in overall survival in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and in the all-randomized population.</p>
<p>However, the combination did not meet the other primary endpoint of progression-free survival by BICR in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.</p>
<p>Ian Waxman, development lead, gastrointestinal cancers, BMS, said: &ldquo;The results for these Opdivo-based combinations represent a significant advancement for patients with esophageal cancer who are often diagnosed after their disease has spread and would benefit from new therapeutic options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study further demonstrates our commitment to pursue combination strategies that improve outcomes for patients with high unmet need, such as those with gastrointestinal cancers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Growing body of evidence</h2>
<p>The data from CheckMate -648 build upon those from CheckMate -649, together making Opdivo the first and only PD-1/L1 inhibitor to demonstrate superior first-line survival in upper gastrointestinal cancers across histologies and tumor locations.</p>

<p>The trial did not meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint, which was defined as a difference in the proportion of participants progressing to the first occurrence of non-invasive ventilation including high flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death by Day 28. Baricitinib-treated patients were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical) or death, a difference that was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR]: 0.85; 95% CI 0.67, 1.08; p=0.1800).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a second disappoint for Lilly in its coronavirus ambitions, as a couple of weeks ago, the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/usa-drops-lilly-s-biologic-monotherapy-for-covid-19"">US government said it will no longer distribute</a> the COVID-19 monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for use on its own.</p>
<p>Baricitinib, which was discovered by Incyte and is marketed under the brand name Olumiant, has been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration in combination with remdesivir for COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen.</p>
<h2><strong>Further study details</strong></h2>
<p>In COV-BARRIER, treatment with baricitinib in addition to SoC (which included 79% receiving corticosteroids and 19% receiving remdesivir, with some receiving both) resulted in a significant reduction (nominal p-value=0.0018) in death from any cause by 38% (n/N: 62/764 [8.1%] baricitinib, 100/761 [13.1%] placebo; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.78) by Day 28.</p>
<p>A numerical reduction in mortality was observed for all baseline severity subgroups of baricitinib-treated patients and was most pronounced for patients receiving non-invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (17.5% versus 29.4% for baricitinib plus SoC versus SoC; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.80; nominal p-value=0.0065). A reduction in mortality was also seen for the pre-specified subgroups of patients being treated with or without corticosteroids at baseline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shares in the Polish oncology specialist fell over 10% after the opening bell on Friday.</p>
<p>Ryvu, which is focused on developing novel small molecules, believes the selective CDK8/CDK19 kinase inhibitor has potential for the treatment of blood cancer and solid tumors.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration stopped the trial of Ryvu&rsquo;s lead candidate after the firm reported a patient death, which it said &ldquo;may possibly be related to RVU120.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trial program is designed to investigate RVU120, which is also known as SEL120, in people with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).</p>
<p>The company said it plans to work diligently with the agency to address the comments and request, in order to resolve the partial clinical hold.</p>
<h2>Ryvu progress</h2>
<p>Founded in 2019, Ryvu was formed when the oncology therapeutics and contract research business units at Polish company Selvita (WSE: SLV) were split.</p>
<p>The new biotech subsequently inked a research collaboration with Belgium&rsquo;s Galapagos (Euronext: GLPG), aimed at the discovery and development of small-molecule drugs in inflammation.</p>
<p>In addition to its lead candidate, Ryvu is developing MEN1703, a dual PIM/FLT3 kinase inhibitor licensed to the Menarini Group and currently in Phase II studies in AML.</p>

We are now delighted to work with the highly motivated team at ValenzaBio to bring this antibody to autoimmune patients with medical needs,&rdquo; said Nathalie Corvaia, head of immune-oncology research at Pierre Fabre.</p>
<h2><strong>Terms of the accord</strong></h2>
<p>Under the terms of the license and commercialization deal, Pierre Fabre will receive an upfront payment at signature, as well as additional development and sales milestone payments and will be eligible to receive royalties on future ValenzaBio sales. In addition, Pierre Fabre will make an equity investment in ValenzaBio.</p>
<p>Under the planned partnership, Pierre Fabre will have the option to reclaim rights in territories outside North America upon completion of the proof-of-concept in the TED indication. Pierre Fabre in return would then pay ValenzaBio royalties on sales in these territories.</p>
<p>TED is a debilitating auto-immune disease associated with eye orbital inflammation and tissue remodeling which can result in significant proptosis, and might lead to vision loss. Steroids are currently the first-line treatment but present several drawbacks complicating patient journey (lack of long-term efficacy, burden of administration scheme, promote comorbidities). Current evidence indicates that IGF-1R is a proven target of interest that can bring value to patients.</p>","2021-04-08 15:46:00","Pierre Fabre and ValenzaBio collaborate on anti-IGF-1R antibody for TE","Pierre Fabre, ValenzaBio, License, Agreement, Thyroid eye disease.

<p>Ofatumumab has the potential to become a recognized treatment option for eligible UK patients with RMS that can be self-administered, with initial guidance from an appropriately trained healthcare professional, once monthly at home via the Sensoready autoinjector pen, said the Swiss pharma giant, which has licensed the drug from Danish cancer specialist Genmab (Nasdaq: GMAB).</p>
<p>Ofatumumab is one of the first treatments to undergo the new regulatory process following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union. The final Marketing Authorization (MA) from the MHRA, brings eligible patients living with RMS a step closer to access Kesimpta in England, Scotland and Wales. Initial decisions on Kesimpta from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicine Consortium (SMC) are expected to publish their final advice this year.</p>
<h2><strong>Competitive sector</strong></h2>
<p>Kesimpta is entering a crowded market, with a number of new drugs having debuted in the MS therapy area recently.</p>
<p>With Swiss rival Roche&rsquo;s Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) boasting impressive levels of efficacy, Novartis will face stiff competition. Roche&rsquo;s offering - which also has a lower wholesale acquisition cost - is expected by analysts to be the market leader by 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The MS Trust is delighted that ofatumumab, the first self-administered B-cell therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS with active disease, has been granted both MHRA and EMA licence. Relapsing forms of MS can have a serious and difficult impact on all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; said David Martin, chief executive of the Multiple Sclerosis Trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Novartis we are proud to be offering innovative treatments that help improve the lives of people living with MS,&rdquo; said Chinmay Bhatt, managing director UK, Ireland &amp; Nordics for Novartis Pharmaceuticals, adding: &ldquo;Ofatumumab is an innovative treatment for those in the beginning stages of their MS journey. Ofatumumab demonstrates our commitment to reimagining medicine and we will work closely with all UK stakeholders to ensure eligible patients can start benefitting from this treatment as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Novartis in multiple sclerosis</strong></h2>
<p>The current Novartis MS portfolio includes Gilenya (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is licensed in the UK and Europe for the treatment of adults and children aged 10 years and older with highly active relapsing remitting forms of MS.</p>
<p>Mayzent (siponimod) is licensed in the UK and Europe for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity.</p>
<p>Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is licensed in the UK and Europe to treat people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), people with SPMS with active disease (evidenced by relapses) and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS with an active inflammatory process.</p>

Though volume growth could remain weak in the near term, the market is expected to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate in the upcoming months.<br /> <br /> Prices of essential medicines including painkillers, anti-infectives, cardiac drugs and antibiotics are set to go up at the end of the month, with the government allowing drugmakers an increase in line with the change in the annual Wholesale Price Index (WPI).<br /> <br /> The annual change in WPI notified by the government works out to 0.5% for 2020, according to the drug prices regulator National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA).</p>

488279,,"Blockchain and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout","Hannah Schofield, associate at Hogan Lovells, considers the option of utilizing blockchain technology for accurate tracking and monitoring in an Expert View piece.","<p><em>Hannah Schofield, associate at Hogan Lovells, considers the option of utilizing blockchain technology for accurate tracking and monitoring in an Expert View piece.</em></p>
<p>The UK has one of the world&rsquo;s most advanced COVID-19 vaccine roll-out programs. More than 20 million people have now received their first COVID-19 vaccination in the UK and more than 800,000 have received their second dose. According to a UK government press release, the vaccines are now being administered at 267 hospitals, 1,034 local vaccination sites, 90 vaccination centers and 194 community pharmacies<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sheer scale of what is being delivered is completely unprecedented, and with it comes an even greater need to ensure that the rapid rollout is accurately monitored, and effectively and safely delivered.</p>
<p>The rollout of any new drug or vaccine will always have its complexities because of the number of intermediaries involved; the COVID-19 vaccines have added complications due to the fact that there are several different vaccines with different storage requirements. Some must be permanently stored at exact temperatures in order to be effective and this temperature must then be maintained from the time of manufacture, through the distribution centers, during transit, as well as in the hospitals and vaccination centers.</p>
<p>A further complication is that the vaccines are not currently interchangeable, so a patient&rsquo;s subsequent dose must be the same as their first. This requires additional monitoring and coordination from suppliers and medical professionals.</p>
<p>The sheer scale and speed required by the COVID-19 vaccine rollout means that a well-functioning supply chain is essential, as well as careful monitoring to ensure the process is safe, reliable, traceable and that errors are minimized.</p>
<h2>How can blockchain help?</h2>
<p>Coupled with the use of internet of things (IoT) technology (eg, temperature sensors), blockchain could be used to monitor important information about the transport and storage of vaccine batches. For the COVID-19 vaccines in particular, it is essential to monitor the temperature as well as length of time in storage, because the different vaccines have different storage requirements. This means accurate monitoring of the different batches of the different drugs is all the more important.</p>
<p>This monitoring could be done through IoT sensors which are affixed to the vaccine storage and transportation containers. These sensors would collect, store, and transmit information on temperature (as well as other useful data), storing it on the blockchain. Other authorized parties in the vaccine delivery chain, including hospitals, distributors and regulators could then immediately view this information on the blockchain, allowing them to check that the vaccines were transported and stored correctly and are therefore safe and effective.</p>
<p>Blockchain could also assist with quick detection and identification of problematic products (eg, faulty, incorrectly stored or counterfeit products) and with their subsequent recall from the supply chain. If an issue is detected, the user could look at all previous data entries, touchpoints, locations and timestamps to trace back to find the origin, specific manufacturer and even the specific batch that it came from.</p>
<p>There are further safety mechanisms built in to the blockchain, as any attempts to amend the data in the chain would be immediately visible to all authorized participants and would be rejected. This not only improves authenticity, but also enables ways of verifying that any entities<br />handling the product have complied with regulatory requirements.</p>
<h2>Implementation in NHS hospitals</h2>
<p>It is exciting that we are already starting to see a move towards the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology<sub>2</sub> within the UK National Health Service (NHS), as two hospitals (in Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon) have started using distributed ledger technology to monitor the storage and supply of temperature-sensitive COVID-19 vaccines. There are two companies involved: digital asset tracking and monitoring provider, Everyware (which already works with the NHS on monitoring other vaccines and treatments including chemotherapy drugs, blood and plasma), and Texas-based distributed ledger provider, Hedera Hashgraph (which is owned and governed by companies such as IBM, Boeing and Google). Everyware provides the temperature-sensitive monitoring sensors and the information is logged on Hedera&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p>A normal database can be tampered with, and individuals may be able to edit or remove important information. Hedera&rsquo;s process works by using Everyware&rsquo;s sensors to constantly monitor the temperature of the refrigeration units. The information collected from those sensors is then logged to the decentralised Hedera network. The Hedera network &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; act as the unbiased neutral party to arrange and timestamp the data from the sensors. This makes the whole process more secure, trustworthy and tamper-proof, as it means the database exists across several locations and several parties, and is therefore not reliant on one single centralized authority (as is the case with &lsquo;normal&rsquo; databases, which essentially have one single point of potential failure). This information is then immediately available to any parties who have been given access to it. Distributed ledger technology therefore provides a tamper-proof record-keeping system where integrity and trustworthiness of the data is maintained and results are recorded, validated and shared across the supply chain in a cost-effective, secure and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Although it cannot eliminate risks completely, blockchain (and distributed ledger technology more generally) can help to reduce the risks and issues associated with the use of manual systems.</p>
<p>Due to its immutability, transparency and traceability, it can offer efficient and accurate end-to-end tracking and monitoring of the vaccine supply chain and can provide a verifiable and auditable account of information. As the distribution of the vaccines by the NHS continues, a wider rollout of the technology is planned and it is hoped that the technology will be used to improve record-keeping and data-sharing across the entire vaccine supply chain. Other jurisdictions are likely to follow suit, making blockchain technology an important part of the COVID-19 recovery process.</p>

<p>2&nbsp;Distributed ledgers are effectively decentralized databases, which eliminate the need for a central authority to process, validate or authenticate transactions or data exchanges. Each entry is timestamped and is assigned a unique cryptographic signature. The entry is then viewable by all participants on the ledger, who can all be in different locations. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.</p>

488276,,"EMA finds possible link of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine with rare blood clots","In the latest update on the saga relating to the safety of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, the European Medicines Agency has today announced its conclusion that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of Vaxzevria (formerly called COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca).","<p>In the latest update on the saga relating to the safety of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) vaccine, the European Medicines Agency has today announced its conclusion that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of Vaxzevria (formerly called COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca).</p>
<p>The EMA&rsquo;s safety committee, the PRAC, noted that the blood clots occurred in veins in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, CVST) and the abdomen (splanchnic vein thrombosis) and in arteries, together with low levels of blood platelets and sometimes bleeding.</p>
<p>The benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks for people who receive it. The vaccine is effective at preventing COVID-19 and reducing hospitalisations and deaths.</p>
<p>Shares of the UK pharma major, which is distributing the vaccine globally on a not-for-profit basis, dipped just under 1% as trading was coming to an end for the day.</p>
<p>The Committee carried out an in-depth review of 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 24 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis reported in the EU drug safety database (EudraVigilance) as of March 22, 2021, 18 of which were fatal. The cases came mainly from spontaneous reporting systems of the EEA and the UK, where around 25 million people had received the vaccine.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is associated with a risk of hospitalization and death. The reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.</p>
<p>One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin (heparin induced thrombocytopenia, HIT). The PRAC has requested new studies and amendments to ongoing ones to provide more information and will take any further actions necessary.</p>
<h2><strong>MHRA sees reason to stop offering the jab to under 30-year-olds</strong></h2>
<p>Also this afternoon, a review by the UK&rsquo;s drugs regulator the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found that, by the end of March, 79 people in the UK suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom died.</p>
<p>The regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clot, but the link was getting firmer. Dr June Raine, head of the MHRA, said the side-effects were ""extremely rare"" - and more work was going on to identify if the vaccine was definitely causing the clots.</p>
<p>She said: ""The balance of benefits and known risks is still very favorable for the majority of people."" But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced.""</p>
<p>The review prompted the government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI, to recommend that people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available. People who have had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still get their second dose. Only those who suffered one of these rare blood clots after the first dose should not get vaccinated, the MHRA said.</p>","2021-04-07 16:20:00","EMA finds possible link of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine with rare bl","AstraZeneca, COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, Blood clots, EMA, MHRA","EMA finds possible link of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine with rare blood clots",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-07 16:17:05","2021-04-07 16:25:06",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-finds-possible-link-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-with-rare-blood-clots,,,,,,covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_large.png,covid_astrazeneca_vaccine_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation","Europe, UK",AstraZeneca,"COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Phase I results show that antibodies that were elicited by COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna persisted through six months after the second dose, as detected by three distinct serologic assays.</p>
<p>Ongoing studies are monitoring immune responses beyond six months as well as determining the effect of a booster dose to extend the duration and breadth of activity against emerging viral variants.</p>
<p>The lead author of the research summary, Nicole Doria-Rose, from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote: &ldquo;Our data show antibody persistence and thus support the use of this vaccine in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This research comes after data published in January showed that the two-dose regimen of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine at the 100&micro;g dose is expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK has begun the rollout of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. It is the third coronavirus jab to be rolled out in the country, following on from those produced by Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX), and AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN).</p>
<p>The UK has bought 17 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, and Phase III results suggest it has 100% efficacy against severe cases. Along with the Pfizer jab, it will be offered to British people aged under 30 years as an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been linked with cases of blood clots and so has a more marginal risk versus benefit profile in that age group.</p>

488267,,"Oxford pauses pediatric trial of AstraZeneca vaccine","Scientists at The University of Oxford have paused a UK-based pediatric trial testing Vaxzevria, the group’s AstraZeneca-partnered coronavirus vaccine.","<p>Scientists at The University of Oxford have paused a UK-based pediatric trial testing Vaxzevria (formerly dubbed AZD1222), the group&rsquo;s AstraZeneca-partnered (LSE: AZN) coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>The decision was made in the context of uncertainty over a possible connection with a rare form of blood clot, known as cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT).</p>
<p>Authorities, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the World Health Organization, have said the benefits continue to outweigh any possible risk, and the vaccine should continue to be used.</p>
<p>The EMA is due to hold a press briefing on Wednesday afternoon regarding its investigation into the safety of the vaccine.</p>
<p>While researchers are unclear whether there is a connection, regulators in France, Germany and Canada have all said the vaccine should be used only in older people, where the risk from COVID-19 is higher, and from CSVT lower.</p>
<h2>Trial pause</h2>
<p>Oxford University made clear that there had been no concerning safety signals coming from the small trial, which is seeking to enroll 300 children and teenagers in Britain.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s medicines watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is already investigating reports of a connection between the vaccine, previously known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, and the rare blood clots.</p>
<p>Scientists at Oxford said they would await guidance from the regulator before resuming the trial, part of a wider push from developers to secure approval for coronavirus vaccines in younger people.</p>
<p>Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) has begun testing its vaccine in children over 12, while Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX) have initiated a study of their option in children aged six-12.</p>

488269,,"Sanofi Global Health set up to provide 30 essential meds to poorest countries","Paul Hudson, chief executive of French pharma major Sanofi today outlined several key projects that the company will implement to increase the impact of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy.","<p>Paul Hudson, chief executive of French pharma major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) today outlined several key projects that the company will implement to increase the impact of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy.</p>
<p>Embedded in Sanofi's long-term strategy, the company&rsquo;s commitment is based on four essential pillars in which Sanofi is uniquely positioned to make a difference: access to medicines, support for vulnerable communities, preservation of the environment, and inclusion and diversity of its employees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pandemic has forced us to question nearly every aspect of our lives: how we live and work, and how we connect with our communities and the planet. Yet as challenging as 2020 was, it also brought us &ndash; Sanofi and the pharmaceutical industry &ndash; closer to our purpose than at any other time in living memory,&rdquo; said Mr Hudson.</p>
<h2><strong>Pillar of access to essential medicines</strong></h2>
<p>A cornerstone of Sanofi&rsquo;s CSR strategy, Sanofi Global Health is a newly-formed non-profit unit within the company. Leveraging the company&rsquo;s diverse and large portfolio of medicines and global footprint, Sanofi Global Health is dedicated to increasing access to medicines considered essential by the World Health Organization (WHO) for patients in&nbsp;40 lower income countries. 30 of Sanofi's medicines will be provided across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, malaria and cancer<strong>. </strong>Sanofi Global Health will also fund the training of healthcare professionals or the set up and development of sustainable care systems for those who suffer from chronic diseases and require complex care.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sanofi is committed to helping 1,000 patients living with rare diseases who have no access to treatments and will donate 100,000 vials of medicine for their treatments each year. This continues Sanofi&rsquo;s 30-year commitment to patients suffering from rare diseases, such as Fabry, Gaucher or Pompe diseases, for which access to treatment is often limited.</p>
<p>Sanofi also continues to support vulnerable communities and commits to developing innovative medicines for pediatric cancer, with the ultimate ambition of eliminating cancer deaths in children. In low- to middle-income countries, a child is four times more likely to die of pediatric cancers than children living in high-income countries.</p>
<p>Sanofi also continues its efforts to fight polio and sleeping sickness, two of its historical programs that address global health issues. In December 2020, Sanofi <a href=""https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-12-15-07-00-00"">announced</a> it had renewed its five-year partnership with the WHO to fight neglected tropical diseases that affect approximately one billion people.</p>

Based on this data, the company plans to commence a Phase III clinical trial by the end of April 2021, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>In study VLA2001-201, three dose levels of VLA2001 (low, medium, high), based on a schedule of two doses with vaccinations three weeks apart, were evaluated in 153 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years.</p>
<p>Valneva started commercial production of VLA2001 at its manufacturing plant in Livingstone, West Lothian, Scotland, in January this year. The plant will potentially have the capacity to supply up to 250 million vaccine doses to the UK and internationally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed Tuesday's announcement as another success for British life sciences. &ldquo;The UK government has funded these clinical trials and it is fantastic to see Valneva&rsquo;s vaccine produces a strong immune response,"" he said.</p>
<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>
<p>VLA2001 was generally safe and well tolerated across all dose groups tested, with no safety concerns identified by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. There were no statistically significant differences between dose groups and no differences between first and second vaccinations in terms of reactogenicity. The majority of Adverse Events (AEs) were mild or moderate and only two subjects reported severe solicited AEs (headache and fatigue). All solicited AEs were transient. Only 17.6% of unsolicited AEs up to day 36 were considered related to the vaccine and no severe unsolicited AEs were reported. No serious related AEs were reported.</p>
<p>VLA2001 was highly immunogenic with more than 90% of all study participants developing significant levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein across all dose groups tested. Seroconversion Rates (SCR) for S-protein binding IgG antibodies were 89.8% in the medium dose and 100% in the high dose group. Two weeks after completion of the two-dose schedule, Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) from baseline were 26 in the medium dose and 86 in the high dose group.</p>
<p>Of note, the IgG antibody response was highly correlated with neutralization titres in a micro-neutralization assay (MNA50) (r=0.79, p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>VLA2001 induced a dose dependent response with statistically significant higher Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) for both IgG and neutralizing antibodies in the high dose group compared to the low and medium dose groups. In the high dose group, the GMT of neutralizing antibody titres measured two weeks after completion of the two-dose schedule was at or above levels for a panel of convalescent sera (GMT 530.4 [95% CI: 421.49, 667.52]).</p>","2021-04-07 10:26:00","Positive data for Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001","Valneva, VLA2001, COVID-19, Phase I/II","Positive data for Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-07 10:25:16","2021-04-07 10:33:00",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/positive-data-for-valneva-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-vla2001,,,,,,valneva-big.jpg,valneva-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"COVID-19 vaccines",Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research","France, UK",Valneva,VLA2001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488266,,"Crucial Brazil decision due on amending national patent law","The Brazilian Supreme Court of Justice is expected to deliver a potentially ground-breaking verdict on the constitutionality of a provision in the country’s intellectual property (IP) law allowing patent term extensions this week, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).","<p>The Brazilian Supreme Court of Justice is expected to deliver a potentially ground-breaking verdict on the constitutionality of a provision in the country&rsquo;s intellectual property (IP) law allowing patent term extensions this week, according to M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF).</p>
<p>If this provision is found unconstitutional and removed, the humanitarian organization argues that it will serve as a progressive step by the judicial system in Brazil towards safeguarding access to affordable medicines for all, preventing abusive patenting practices that keep the prices of lifesaving medicines artificially high for long periods of time.</p>
<h2>More than 70% of patents last longer than 20 years</h2>
<p>Brazil adopted the provision of patent term extensions in its IP law in 1996, leading to automatic and unlimited extended periods of patent protection beyond the international standard set by the World Trade Organization TRIPS agreement that allows patents to last for 20 years from the date the patent application is filed.</p>
<p>In addition to granting patents for a duration of the minimum of 20 years after filling, this provision in Brazil&rsquo;s IP law guarantees an additional minimum of 10 years of patent protection from the date the patent is granted.</p>
<p>As most of the patent applications undergo examination for more than 10 years in Brazil, patent-holding pharmaceutical corporations presently benefit from this provision by availing extra years of a monopoly, allowing them to charge artificially high prices and hinder access to more affordable alternatives, claims the MSF.</p>
<p>Currently, more that 70% of pharmaceutical patents already granted will last longer than 20 years, and more than 80% of pharmaceutical patents under examination can follow the same route.</p>
<p>As a result of this provision, several lifesaving drugs are under extended monopoly protection in Brazil &ndash; with prices several times higher than international reference prices. These include treatments for HIV, diabetes and arthritis.</p>
<p>Bedaquiline, the backbone of drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment that is sold by Janssen under the brand name Sirturo, will be under monopoly in Brazil until 2028, while in other countries the patent will expire in 2023.</p>
<h2>Important precedent internationally</h2>
<p>Felipe de Carvalho, MSF's access campaign coordinator in Brazil, said: &ldquo;The current provision of extending patent terms threatens the sustainability of the universal healthcare system that so many Brazilians rely upon to stay healthy and alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By rendering this provision unconstitutional, the Supreme Court would not only ensure access to medicines needed now for many life-threatening illnesses, but would also safeguard access to potential treatments that will be needed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. We truly hope our judicial system will take the right step in prioritizing people&rsquo;s health over corporate financial interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision could also set a positive precedent for many other countries presently undergoing patent law reformation, such as South Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of us around the world are anxiously waiting for this crucial decision from the Brazilian Supreme Court,&rdquo; said Kate Stegeman, MSF's access campaign advocacy coordinator in South Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the South African government has yet to finalize essential and overdue draft amendments to our Patents Act that presently lacks adequate public health safeguards, this decision in Brazil could serve as a strong impetus for many of us also calling for patent law reforms. Removal of this harmful measure will be a major victory for people&rsquo;s access to affordable medicines in South Africa and around the world.&rdquo;</p>","2021-04-06 17:25:00",,"patent, provision, Brazil, years, access, patents, Supreme, Court, decision, term, extensions, allowing, prices, Brazilian, medicines, national, amending","The Brazilian Supreme Court of Justice is expected to deliver a potentially groundbreaking verdict on the constitutionality of a provision in the country’s inte",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-06 17:11:25","2021-04-06 17:58:24",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/crucial-brazil-decision-due-on-amending-national-patent-law,,,,,,brazil-big.jpg,brazil-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Generics,,"Focus On, Legal, Pricing, reimbursement and access","Brazil, South Africa","Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, MSF","bedaquiline, Sirturo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>As a spokesman of Petrovax said in an interview with the Russian Forbes magazine, currently, the company continues international clinical trials of its Convidetsia vaccine against COVID-19, which are conducted in partnership with the Chinese immunological company CanSino Biologics (HK: 6185).&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Petrovax&rsquo; spokesman, the recruitment of volunteers has already been completed, while analytical work is currently being carried out, and all the documents for registration of the vaccine have already been submitted to the Russian Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>After the registration of the vaccine, the company plans to produce it at its facility in the Moscow region, for which a new, fourth line is being built. According to Petrovax, the active ingredient for the vaccine will be supplied by CanSino, and Petrovax will be responsible for its production in Russia, including all stages of the production cycle - formulation, filling, packaging, quality control, and further export supplies.</p>

<p>These drugs are Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel/ide-cel) from Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE), ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) from Janssen and Legend Biotech (Nasdaq: LEGN), and GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s (LSE: GSK) Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf/belantamab).</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""An important expansion of the clinical armamentarium""</span>Ide-cel is a CAR-T cell therapy that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved last month to treat TCRMM patients after four or more prior lines of therapy, cilta-cel is an investigational CAR T-cell therapy for which a rolling biologic license application was submitted to the FDA in December 2020 and belantamab was approved in August 2020 to treat TCRMM patients after four or more prior lines of therapy.</p>
<p>At a virtual meeting on April 16, the Midwest Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Committee will review the evidence, hear further testimony from stakeholders, and deliberate over these treatments&rsquo; comparative clinical effectiveness, other potential benefits, and long-term value for money.</p>
<p>Steven Pearson, the ICER&rsquo;s president, said: &ldquo;Many people with multiple myeloma develop resistance to existing treatments, so these three new therapies that target BCMA &ndash; a new method of action &ndash; represent an important expansion of the clinical armamentarium available to patients and oncologists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Data are extremely limited for the two CAR-Ts, but those data suggest the potential for patients to live longer with manageable side effects. At our public meeting, our policy roundtable will likely discuss the potential for certain patients to require a second dose of these CAR-Ts, and what the implications will be not only for how T-cells should be initially harvested, but also on the treatments&rsquo; overall pricing, coverage, and long-term value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belantamab appears to deliver more modest clinical benefit, along with some safety concerns that have required the drug to be stopped or reduced in certain instances. At its current pricing, belantamab appears to meet commonly-cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness, but this favorable result is due in part to early discontinuation among many patients, as well as the high prices of the three-drug regimens to which belantamab was compared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ICER&rsquo;s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range for ide-cel is between $192,000 and $265,000 per dose, which would require a 37% to 54% discount off the treatment&rsquo;s recently announced wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of $419,500.</p>
<p>The HBPB assumes that there would be a second charge for individuals requiring retreatment. If a different pricing model were to be adopted, ICER&rsquo;s HBPB for ide-cel would change.</p>
<p>The ICER&rsquo;s HBPB for cilta-cel is between $317,000 and $475,000, with the assumption that a second dose will require payment though this is considered preliminary as the evidence base is extremely limited and unpublished. Janssen, part of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Legend Biotech have not yet announced an estimated or actual price for the therapy.</p>
<p>The HBPB for belantamab is between $8,300 and $9,500 per vial, which would require no discount off the therapy&rsquo;s WAC of $8,277 per vial.</p>
<p>Belantamab is dosed based on a patient&rsquo;s weight, and GSK has projected that the treatment&rsquo;s monthly cost will average $23,900 per patient. However, the monthly cost may be above $32,000 for those requiring three vials.</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness results for belantamab are relatively favorable due in part to patients discontinuing therapy because of side effects, as well as the high prices for the three-drug alternatives, ICER says.</p>
<p>The HBPB is the top price range at which a health system can reward innovation and better health for patients without doing more harm than good, the ICER explained.</p>

<p>One such drugmaker is Geropharm, which has recently announced plans to start the production of insulin in Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of the new production will be part of a long-term agreement, which was signed by the company with the Venezuela&rsquo;s government and is being designed for the period of 2021-2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, the new production will be located at the site of Venezuelan biotechnology firm Espromed Bio site, with which Geropharm established production links back in 2019. The production will be carried in the form of a finished dosage form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to investments, Geropharm will transfer the know-how for the production of finished insulin preparations to its Venezuelan partners. In addition, the company will also continue to supply insulin analogs from Russia.</p>
<h2><strong>Venezuela&rsquo;s govt to guarantee purchases</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>In the meantime, the Venezuelan government, from its side, will provide the company all the needed assistance during implementation of the project and guarantee the purchase of insulin preparations for the next five years - until 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to official statistics, currently more than 2.96 million people suffer from diabetes in Venezuela. The needs of the country in insulin within the next five years are estimated at about 34 million packs. It is planned, the launch of the new project will allow to improve the situation with their treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geropharm has been supplying insulin preparations to Venezuela on a regular basis since 2019. At the same time, there are no local producers. To date, Geropharm has already delivered over 3 million packages of drugs to the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geropharm is expected to be not the only Russian drugmaker planning to localize production in Venezuela and some other regional states, as, according to some Russian media reports, other pharmaceutical producers from Russia have similar plans.</p>","2021-04-06 12:02:00","Russia’s pharma to accelerate expansion into Central and South America","Genopharm, Production, Insulin, Venezuela, Espromed Bio","Russia’s pharma to accelerate expansion into Central and South America",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-06 12:01:27","2021-04-06 13:42:24",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-pharma-to-accelerate-expansion-into-central-and-south-america,,,,,,geropharm-big.jpg,geropharm-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,Diabetes,"Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Production, Russian market","Central America, Russia, South America, Venezuela","Espromed Bio, Geropharm",Insulin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The FDA issued a CRL to indicate that it has completed the review of the application and has determined that the sNDA cannot be approved in its present form.</p>
<p>Despite prior agreements with the Division of Psychiatry regarding the pivotal Phase III HARMONY study design targeting a broad DRP patient population analyzed as a single group, the Division, in the CRL, cited a lack of statistical significance in some of the subgroups of dementia, and insufficient numbers of patients with certain less common dementia subtypes as lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness to support approval, noted Acadia.</p>
<p>Approved in 2016, Acadia currently markets the atypical antipsychotic as for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease psychosis.</p>
<p>The DRP pivotal HARMONY study met its pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints with robust and persuasive clinical and statistical superiority of pimavanserin over placebo, which was a prospectively agreed prerequisite for the DRP indication. Statistical separation by dementia subgroups and certain minimum numbers of patients with specific subtypes were not among the prespecified requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Will request a Type A meeting</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Acadia stands behind the robustly positive results from the pivotal Phase III HARMONY study and the prospectively agreed trial design and criteria for establishing efficacy in DRP. Over the entire course of the review, the Division did not raise any concerns regarding the agreed upon study design, including the issues raised in the CRL,&rdquo; said Steve Davis, chief executive</p>
<p>of Acadia. &ldquo;We will immediately request a Type A meeting to work with the FDA to address the CRL and determine an expeditious path forward for the approval of pimavanserin in DRP,&rdquo; he stressed.</p>
<p>The Division also stated in the CRL that it considers the Phase II Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease psychosis study -019, a supportive study in the sNDA filing, to not be adequate and well controlled, citing that it was a single center study with no type I error control of secondary endpoints in which certain protocol deviations occurred. The Company believes these observations impact neither the positive results on the study&rsquo;s primary endpoint, nor the study&rsquo;s overall conclusions of efficacy.</p>","2021-04-06 10:56:00","Acadia to take issue with FDA over CRL for Nuplazid sBLA","Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Nuplazid, sBLA, FDA, Complete response letter, CRL, Psychosis, Dementia-related, DRP","Acadia to take issue with FDA over CRL for Nuplazid sBLA",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-06 10:55:38","2021-04-06 11:02:31",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/acadia-to-take-issue-with-fda-over-crl-for-nuplazid-sbla,,,,,,acadiabig.png,acadiasmall.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals","Nuplazid, pimavanserin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The privately-held company has been granted a broader label for the product, to include treatment of snake bites from rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouth or water moccasins.</p>
<p>The product was previously indicated for the management of adult and pediatric patients with North American rattlesnake envenomation.</p>
<p>RDT exclusively markets Anavip in the USA, in partnership with manufacturer Laboratorios Silanes, a Mexico-based antivenom specialist.</p>
<p>It is estimated that around 7,000&ndash;8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the USA annually, with many suffering blood clotting disorders as a long-term consequence.</p>
<p>One of the goals of treatment is to limit the potential incidence of such disorders. Anavip has been specifically engineered with a long half-life to minimize the likelihood of re-emergent venom effects, which commonly require additional doses.</p>
<p>Chief executive Milton Ellis said: &ldquo;This new expanded indication demonstrates not only the remarkable scientific value of Anavip, but also the significant unmet need for treatment options that has existed for North American Pit Viper envenomated patients in the USA.&rdquo;</p>

This agreement was facilitated by Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.</p>
<p>Under the collaboration, Cidara will be responsible for the development and manufacturing of the first influenza AVC, CD388, into the clinic and through Phase II clinical development, and Janssen for late-stage development, manufacturing, registration and global commercialization.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial terms of the collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>Cidara will receive an upfront payment of $27 million and Janssen will fund all future research, development, manufacturing and commercialization for CD388. In addition, Cidara is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $753 million in budgeted R&amp;D funding and in development, regulatory and commercial milestones, plus tiered royalties on worldwide sales in the mid to high single digits.

488251,,"MNCs in fast-changing China; HKEX expects SPAC soon","Multinational companies (MNCs) must evolve their strategies with a fast-paced China to succeed in the highly competitive market, said company representatives at the two-day 2021 China healthcare investment conference on March 24 in Shanghai.","<p>Multinational companies (MNCs) must evolve their strategies with a fast-paced China to succeed in the highly competitive market, said company representatives at the two-day 2021 China healthcare investment conference on March 24 in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regulation changes deserve top priority for MNCs, said the general manager of Sanofi (Euronext; SAN) China, Pius Hornstein. &ldquo;Speeding up your R&amp;D process is not enough. you have to build a top-class regulatory team to be able to speed up the process,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He gave Dupixent (dupilumab) as an example. The eczema treatment was added to China&rsquo;s national reimbursement drug list (NRDL) in January 2021, five months after it was approved in the country. In contrast, it takes about 17 months on average for a newly approved drug to get into the list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly was not an easy achievement. We made it because we have the best team,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A best class commercialization team will be necessary once the drug is on the NRDL. &ldquo;You will have to think about whom you should partner with, how you do it, who&rsquo;s doing which part to meet each milestone. This is quite complicated,&rdquo; Dr Hornstein said.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to commercialization, but the traditional way of hiring thousands of sales persons is clearly antiquated, said Dr Hornstein.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe the time for such hiring is over. We believe we will have to use a completely different approach in the next two to three years,&rdquo; he said. He was talking about going digital.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>China pushing society to go digital</strong></h2>
<p>China is known for being aggressive in pushing the whole society to go digital and Sanofi has adapted itself to the trend. In recent years it has partnered with Chinese tech giants including Alibaba and Tencent to provide chronic disease management services. It is also the first multinational pharma in China that moved its entire workforce communication on WeChat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a market as loud as China&rsquo;s, you have to be precise about what you do and who you target. Good science must be combined with targeted digital communication to boost success. Having medical representatives visit doctors all the over the country is far from enough,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2><strong>MNCs can benefit from great ecosystem, says Pfizer</strong></h2>
<p>For Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), the buoyant Chinese market, backed by a growing number of innovative, ambitious Chinese biotechs, offers a great ecosystem that MNCs can benefit, said Pfizer Asia region president Pierre Gaudreault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China&rsquo;s booming biotech infrastructure allowed companies like us to involve in partnering with local biotechs that fit for China&rsquo;s innovation agenda,&rdquo; he said. In 2020 alone, Pfizer partnered with CStone to co-develop the latter&rsquo;s oncology asset sugemalimab, a PD L1 antibody; It chose LianBio to jointly explore novel therapies in China, and it signed up with the vaccine maker CanSino Bio to market the latter&rsquo;s proprietary meningococcal vaccine in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea is to provide the value a MNC like Pfizer can bring to Chinese partners, and MNCs can benefit from Chinese companies&rsquo; knowledge and expertise,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Gaudreault agreed with Sanofi&rsquo;s Dr Hornstein that digital is essential. Pfizer in November 2020 partnered with multiple online platforms, including Alibaba, JD and Ping An Good Doctor, to provide services to manage chronic diseases such as RA and eczema. This move was in line with Pfizer&rsquo;s plan to expand its businesses in rural areas in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pfizer is very presented in big Chinese cities and now we are providing support to healthcare system in rural areas and small cities, and it is something we will put enormous efforts into in the years to come,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer is also discussing with Chinese authorities about how to build an ecosystem to support local innovation to attract investments. Such discussions cover a wide range of topics, including drug reimbursement and regulatory processing ease, said Mr Gaudreault.</p>
<p>Pricing is a challenge that every drug company in China has to face. Drastic price cuts threaten innovation which will certainly have consequences, said Dr Hornstein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you attract companies to do novel research if the price is that low?&rdquo; he questioned. Sanofi&rsquo;s Dupixent, for example, had to cut the price by 50% to get into the NRDL.</p>
<p>A major reason for Chinese authorities pursuing aggressive price cuts is that the national universal social insurance scheme still monopolizes the country&rsquo;s massive health insurance market. Despite the rising voices inside China warning such a monopoly could hinder drug innovation, the authorities gave no promise of change.</p>
<h2><strong>But investors are nonetheless chasing Chinese biotechs</strong></h2>
<p>In 2020, the HKEX saw 21 initial public offerings (IPOs) by Chinese biotech and healthcare companies, raising over HK$84.1 billion ($11 billion), more than doubled from 2019. Former HKEX chief executive Charles Li said at the conference that it is highly likely that the exchange will introduce its own Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) framework soon to attract more Chinese biotech start-ups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the HKEX-version of SPAC could be ideal to bring smaller biotechs to the market because they either don&rsquo;t think about an IPO or are barely qualified for an IPO,&rdquo; Mr Li said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that unlike in the USA, where vetting, or background investigation is not a regulatory requirement for companies going public through a SPAC, the regulators in Hong Kong will make sure that vetting plays an important role in its SPAC framework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you cannot use a SPAC as some sort of listing regulatory arbitrage,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>This was a welcome development for Supernus, which in November last year received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for SPN-812 (viloxazine hydrochloride; SPN-812) from the FDA, for the treatment of children with ADHD.</p>
<p>The agency primarily raised concerns over Supernus&rsquo; in-house laboratory, which the firm said &ldquo;recently moved to a new location.&rdquo; Prior to that, the firm received a Refusal to File (RTF) letter from the FDA regarding its submission for this candidate.</p>
<h2><strong>A not controlled substance with proven efficacy</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the efficacy demonstrated in the clinical program, we believe Qelbree offers a unique new alternative for the treatment of ADHD,&rdquo; said Jack Khattar, president and chief executive of Supernus, adding: &ldquo;Qelbree provides prescribing physicians and patients living with ADHD a therapy that is not a controlled substance with proven efficacy and a tolerable safety profile.

This approval offers a novel once a day sprinkleable non-stimulant that can be a great option for children and adolescents with ADHD.&rdquo;</p>

BioNTech and Pfizer presented more positive news on their COVID-19 vaccine BNT 162b2, this time on its efficacy in children, while Johnson &amp; Johnson hit a production quality snag relating to its COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.</p>
<h2><strong>FDA approves Abecma in r/r multiple myeloma as expected</strong></h2>
<p>On Friday, <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-first-car-t-therapy-for-multiple-myeloma"">the US FDA approved Abecma</a> (formerly idecabtagene vicleucel [ide-cel] or bb2121) as the first CAR-T cell therapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). Timing of the approval gives bluebird bio and Bristol Myers Squibb an around nine month lead versus competitors Johnson &amp; Johnson and Legend Biotech, commented SVB Leerink Research analyst Dr Mani Foroohar. The label includes black boxed warnings (mostly as expected). To mitigate safety concerns, Abecma is available through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) that requires administration at a certified healthcare facility. Leerink updates its model to reflect approval (increasing PoS to 100%).</p>
<p>The process of production and administration of Abecma takes ~three weeks, and bluebird/Bristol Myers will split the manufacturing burden in the USA. bluebird is in the process of building out its manufacturing facility in Durham, NC, for lentiviral vector manufacturing in the USA and to support the rest of their pipeline. BMS will eventually assume responsibility for lentiviral vector manufacturing OUS; Dr Foroohar sees this as broadly in line with expectations around the split of obligations.<br /> <br /> Abecma will have a list price of $419,500 in the US and he estimates a net price of $375,000. After increasing our PoS of Abecma to 100%, Leerink models peak revenues of $629 million attributable to bluebird, as US economics are equally split between BLUE and BMY. BMY previously bought out ex-US milestone and royalty obligations for Abecma and bb21217 for an upfront payment of $200 million. As a result of these changes, our bluebird PT increases to $72 from $69/share.</p>
<p>Also commenting, Amber Ton writing on EndPoint News noted that, once a closely-watched event, the approval of ide-cel in multiple myeloma received a relatively muted welcome when it was announced Friday afternoon. It was largely expected by analysts, who were however surprised by parts of the label.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were surprised by a few aspects of the label: Abecma was approved for 5L+, versus our expectation of 4L+, and HLH was included as a black box warning,&rdquo; Stifel analyst Benjamin Burnett wrote. &ldquo;However, after reflecting on these points with a KOL (tertiary care physician who leads CAR-T efforts at his institution), we think neither will significantly impact adoption,&rdquo; said Dr Foroohar.</p>
<p>Biren Amin of Jefferies, meanwhile, noted that the approved dose range of 300-400 million cells was narrower than expected. He added that the approval bodes well for J&amp;J-partnered Legend Biotech, whose BCMA CAR-T, cilta-cel, has a PDUFA date lined up for this year.</p>
<p>At least some investors were energized, bidding bluebird shares $BLUE up 8.27% to $32.46.</p>
<h2><strong>AbbVie is a strong contender for migraine market following accepted NDA from FDA for atogepant</strong></h2>
<p>Following the news on March 30 that the FDA has accepted AbbVie&rsquo;s new drug <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accepts-abbvie-s-filing-for-atogepant-for-migraine-prevention"">application for atogepant</a> for the preventive treatment of migraine, Christine Wong, pharma analyst at analytics company GlobalData offered her views.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;If approved, atogepant will be the first and only oral CGRP receptor antagonist specifically developed to reduce the mean number of migraine days for patients and will be launched as a preventative treatment. GlobalData anticipates good uptake for atogepant, forecasting annual global revenue of $766 million in 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atogepant is expected to face considerable competition from CGRP monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), most notably Amgen&rsquo;s erenumab, Eli Lilly&rsquo;s galcanezumab, Teva&rsquo;s fremanezumab, and Alder&rsquo;s eptinezumab. While these drugs address the need for effective prophylactic treatments, they are expected to be expensive, which may act as a barrier to uptake. Atogepant could have a competitive advantage, given that it can be administered orally, which may be preferred by patients and also be more cost-effective than the MAbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AbbVie is strong contender in the migraine market given its production of treatment options including Botox (onabotulinumtoxin A), and Ubrelvy (ubrogepant). The potential approval of atogepant will allow the company to expand its migraine portfolio.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Amgen takes a swing at regenerative immunology with $721M acquisition of Rodeo </strong></h2>
<p>With blockbuster immunology meds Enbrel and Otezla already in the fold, Amgen has mostly stood pat on infusing new blood into its legacy pipeline, noted Kyle Blankenship writing on EndPoints News. But that success won&rsquo;t last forever, and Amgen is taking a far-looking bet on a private biotech forging a new pathway to treat immune system diseases.</p>
<p>Amgen will pay $55 million upfront and a devilish $666 million in future milestones to acquire Seattle-based <a href=""/content/article/edit/id/~$n%2022%20news%206.docx"">Rodeo Therapeutics</a> and its small-molecule therapies targeting the 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) enzyme potentially implicated in a range of indications, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rodeo uncloaked back in 2017 with a $5.9 million Series A and science from Case Western&rsquo;s Sanford Markowitz, Stanton Gerson from the National Center for Regenerative Medicine and Joseph Ready out of UT Southwestern. It was humble beginnings in terms of seed cash, but Rodeo&rsquo;s plans came with big-name backers, including AbbVie Ventures, Alexandria Venture Investments, ARCH Venture Partners, Eli Lilly, Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, Watson Fund, WRF Capital and WuXi AppTec, Mr Blankenship noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Notwithstanding J&amp;J, outlook for COVID control via &lsquo;vax&rsquo; increasingly positive</strong></h2>
<p>In the past few days, important information has been disclosed about Pfizer and BioNTech&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/latest-pfizer-biontech-results-offer-youthful-optimism"">COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2</a> that makes the prospect of deep and sustained disease control through vaccination even more likely, according to SVB Leering Research analysts. First, the companies disclosed that their vaccine was 100% effective, and highly immunogenic, in adolescents. This is likely to be followed by an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for this age group within a matter of weeks (certainly by mid-year), which then means that many returning high school and college students will be vaccinated during the summer (assuming supply continues to ramp up) and the back-to-school season will be relatively &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second important piece of news is the duration and depth of protection conferred by their vaccine in continued follow-up from their original Phase II/III pivotal trial cohort. The vaccine remains highly effective (90%+) out to six months with no apparent increase in breakthrough cases in the 12,000 subjects so far followed out to six months. There were no unusual, new or increasing adverse reactions to the vaccine reported with extended follow-up. Although the case numbers are small, the vaccine efficacy also appeared to be high (100%) against symptomatic disease caused by the South African (B.1.351) virus variant, which provides important reassurance about the ability of this vaccine to prevent and contain disease, regardless of the viral genotype.</p>
<p>Although Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/j-j-hits-snag-as-covid-19-vaccine-contractor-failed-quality-standards"">lot release failure</a> (and the temporary hold on further production) is a disappointment, the analysts believe normal production (with increased quality controls) is likely to resume in a matter of days or weeks, and the supply of the mRNA products is accelerating rapidly.</p>
<p>The resurgence in infection and hospitalization numbers in many parts of the USA is concerning, but not unexpected, given the ebullient reaction to the decline in cases in the past six weeks or so. The analysts expect these case numbers to accelerate in the coming days and weeks, and then for this to prompt an increased commitment and acceptance of vaccination, which should effectively choke off the virus&rsquo; supply of na&iuml;ve hosts by mid- to late-summer. They remain positive about an overall return to mostly normal social activity by the fall of 2020.</p>
<p>For Pfizer and BioNTech, these events suggest to the analysts that the bullish guidance for doses and revenue supplied by BioNTech earlier this week can indeed be met, or exceeded, depending on the demand for BNT162b2 outside the USA in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>They still expect &ldquo;2nd generation&rdquo; COVID vaccines, containing the spike protein antigen from B.1.351 or a similar strain, to be introduced in mid- to late-summer, and to ultimately become the standard of care for boosting and priming schedules once supply transitions to the new sequence product.</p>","2021-04-04 11:33:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 2, 2021","News review, Bristol Myers, bluebird bio, Abecma, AbbVie, Atogepant, Amgen, Rodeo, 15-PGDH program, BioNTech, Pfizer, BNT162b2, Johnson & Johnson, COVID-19","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 2, 2021",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-04-04 11:31:07","2021-04-04 13:41:07",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-2-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,Migraine,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Analgesia, Cell and Gene Therapy, Hematology, Infectious diseases, Neurological, Regenerative Medicine, Vaccines","Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation, Research",,"AbbVie, Amgen, BioNTech, bluebird bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Rodeo Therapeutics","Abecma, atogepant, BNT162b2, COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>OPTION 2 was designed as a Phase IIb multicenter study to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MS1819 (in enteric capsules) in a head-to-head comparison against the current porcine enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) standard of care for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in patients with cystic fibrosis. The primary efficacy endpoint was the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), with secondary endpoints of stool weight, signs and symptoms of malabsorption and coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA).</p>
<p>The trial also included an extension arm that used an immediate release MS1819 capsule, allowing the company to compare data from the existing arm that uses enteric (delayed release) capsules with data from the new arm, and ultimately select the optimal delivery method.</p>
<h2><strong>&lsquo;OPTION 2 top-line results mixed&rsquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Discussing the results during the conference call, James Sapirstein, president, chief executive and chairman of AzurRx, commented: &ldquo;To summarize, the best word to describe the OPTION 2 top-line results is mixed. MS1819 demonstrated itself to be safe and well-tolerated and data from OPTION 2, and other Phase II clinical trials, clearly demonstrate drug activity. However, OPTION 2 did not consistently meet the primary efficacy endpoint. Some patients were able to achieve CFA at levels beyond what is required to demonstrate non-inferiority with PERT therapies, but the majority did not, and as such, we did not meet our trial goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Sapirstein continued: &ldquo;The underlying cause of the drug&rsquo;s uneven efficacy performance in OPTION 2, we believe, lies with the enteric capsule formulation. While the enteric coating protects the capsule from breaking down in the stomach acid, it also appears to dissolve too slowly in the small intestine to release the lipase enzyme in time to aid with proper digestion and nutrient absorption.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We firmly believe the cost-benefit ratio with MS1819 is clearly in our favor. The drug&rsquo;s mechanism of action is known and proven, it offers numerous therapeutic, safety and compliance advantages over today&rsquo;s standard of care, and remains less cumbersome to manufacture. Based on these factors, we believe that should this optimized formulation prove successful in the clinic &ndash; and we have every reason to believe it will &ndash; MS1819 could eventually become the gold standard treatment for EPI in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-statement-on-u-s-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing"">a news release</a>, J&amp;J said quality control checks had flagged the problem before the problematic batch advanced to the filling and finishing stages of its manufacturing process. It said the issue ""was identified and addressed with Emergent,"" adding that it also informed the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>The drug company said the problem involved one batch of a substance that goes into its coronavirus vaccine. It said the apparent mix-up happened at an Emergent site that is part of its manufacturing network but does not yet have FDA authorization to produce part of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Emergent is not currently part of the coronavirus vaccine supply chain but was ramping up to be. This batch was part of the approval process, and would have been used if successful.</p>

<p>This marks the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-sarclisa-for-patients-with-relapsed-refractory-multiple-myeloma"">second FDA approval for Sarclisa</a>, which is also cleared in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adults with RRMM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.</p>
<p>The FDA approved this application three months ahead of the FDA goal date, the agency noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Competition with Darzalex</strong></h2>
<p>Sarclisa is targeting a market currently led by Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (NYSE: JNJ) Darzalex (daratumumab). J&amp;J has also been able to secure approval for a new subcutaneous formulation of Darzalex, dubbed <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-darzalex-fasbro"">Darzalex Faspro</a>, offering a much faster and easier mode of administration.</p>
<p>Analysts have suggested that peak sales of up to $1 billion could be realistic for Sarclisa, while Darzalex is already exceeding $4 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of isatuximab-irfc in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in IKEMA (NCT03275285), a multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, two-arm, Phase III trial in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who had received one to three prior lines of therapy. The trial randomized 302 patients (3:2) to receive isatuximab-irfc with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Isa-Kd) or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd).</p>
<h2><strong>Reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 45%</strong></h2>
<p>In this study, Sarclisa added to Kd (Sarclisa combination therapy) reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 45% (hazard ratio 0.548, 95% CI 0.366-0.822, p=0.0032) versus standard of care Kd alone in patients with multiple myeloma. The median progression free survival (PFS) for Sarclisa combination therapy was not reached at the time of the pre-planned interim analysis, according to Sanofi.</p>
<p>""Treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma remains challenging and the prognosis for patients experiencing multiple relapses unfortunately is poor,"" said Dr Peter Adamson, global development head, oncology and pediatric innovation, at Sanofi. ""With this approval, Sarclisa is now included in two standard of care regimens for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma as early as first relapse.

Praluent is not intended to be used alone but instead added to other treatments for HoFH.</p>
<p>The approval was granted to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: REGN), which markets Praluent, a PCSK9 inhibitor, in partnership with French pharma major French partner Sanofi (Euronext: SAN).</p>
<p>Once billed as having blockbuster potential when first launched in 2015, the drug has never been a big seller for the companies. Sanofi registered full-year 2020 revenues from Praluent of 261 million euros ($316 million), while US sale last year came in at $186 million.</p>
<p><strong>A rare, life-threatening condition</strong></p>
<p>HoFH is a rare, life-threatening condition that occurs in around 1 in 250,000 individuals. Patients with HoFH have two mutations in a small group of genes that controls the way the body clears cholesterol. As a result, patients have extremely high circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), commonly known as &ldquo;bad cholesterol.&rdquo; These cholesterol levels can range as high as 500-1,000 mg/dL, more than four times the normal levels.</p>
<p>Patients with HoFH can develop premature cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and heart disease, when they are teenagers or in their 20s, and many do not improve substantially with other cholesterol-lowering drugs. Without aggressive treatment, patients may die before age 30.</p>
<p>Praluent is also approved to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina (a condition in which the heart does not receive enough blood flow and oxygen) requiring hospitalization in adults with cardiovascular disease.

<p>Under the terms of the deal, GSK will receive an upfront payment of $342 million and up to $50 million in additional payments contingent on the achievement of regulatory approvals of cabozantinib for prostate cancer and lung cancer in the USA and Europe.</p>
<p>Cabometyx, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) both as monotherapy and in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s (NYSE: BMY) Opdivo (nivolumab) as a first line treatment. Cabometyx is also approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients previously treated with sorafenib. Cometriq is approved for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Cabometyx and Cometriq are marketed by Exelixis (Nasdaq: EXEL) in the USA, and by partner partner Ipsen (Euronext: IPN) in regions outside the USA and Japan. Cabometyx is marketed in Japan by Exelixis&rsquo; partner Takeda (TYO: 4502).</p>
<h2><strong>GSK deal with Exelixis</strong></h2>
<p>GSK is entitled to a 3% royalty on worldwide net sales of cabozantinib products as a result of its 2002 collaboration with Exelixis. Under this transaction&rsquo;s terms, Royalty Pharma has purchased royalties on cabozantinib products&rsquo; net sales in non-US markets through the full term of the royalty and royalties on net sales in the USA through September 2026, after which US royalties will remain with GSK.</p>
<p>In 2020, sales of Cabometyx and Cometriq reported by Exelixis and Ipsen were $742 million and 289 million euros ($340 million), respectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to acquire this royalty stream from GSK,&rdquo; said Pablo Legorreta, founder and chief executive of Royalty Pharma, adding: &ldquo;Cabometyx is a leading TKI for the treatment of advanced kidney and liver cancer.

<p>The transaction, financial terms of which were not disclosed, is expected to close early in the second quarter of this year. Qbrexza generated $24 million in net sales in the USA in 2020.</p>
<p>Qbrexza was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018, and is the only topical product for treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric populations (ages nine-years and older) and is self-administered by patients, cleared by the FDA. Additionally, Qbrexza is noted as a first-line treatment therapy for primary axillary hyperhidrosis by the International Hyperhidrosis Society (IHHS). Hyperhidrosis is a condition of sweating beyond what is physiologically required for normal thermal regulation and affects an estimated 4.8% of the US population, or around 15 million people.</p>
<p>At the time of the US approval, peak annual sales of Qbrexza were forecast to reach $200 to $300 million by Cowen analysts.</p>
<p>Claude Maraoui, president and chief executive of Journey Medical, stated, &ldquo;We are thrilled to expand our footprint in dermatology with the addition of Qbrexza to our growing portfolio of prescription dermatology brands. Acquiring Qbrexza will allow us to provide an accessible and convenient product to the millions of Americans who seek relief from excessive underarm sweating, many of whom remain undiagnosed and untreated.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>In two key pivotal trials within adult and pediatric patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, use of Qbrexza resulted in clinically-meaningful improvements in gravimetrically measured sweat production and disease severity, as measured by the Axillary Sweating Daily Diary, which was a validated, disease-specific patient-reported outcome developed in consultation with the FDA. The safety and efficacy of Qbrexza have been established in clinical trials with treatment for up to 48 weeks.</p>
<p>Dr Lindsay Rosenwald, chairman, president and CEO of Fortress, added: &ldquo;The acquisition of Qbrexza marks continued progress for our partner company, Journey Medical, and demonstrates the success of Fortress&rsquo; unique business model, which is designed to acquire and rapidly advance potentially transformative products and product candidates to patients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The move, which does not affect Bharat Biotech&rsquo;s application for emergency use authorization of the vaccine in Brazil, could potentially still delay its ability to supply doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to the country until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>An inspection by the Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitari (ANVISA) from March 1-5 revealed issues related to Bharat Biotech&rsquo;s manufacturing processes. According to the regulator, these issues could potentially risk the quality of the vaccine, and the action plan it sent was not sufficient to mitigate the risks.</p>
<p>Covaxin is approved for emergency use in India for its mega vaccination drive, which started on January 16, 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfillment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon,&rdquo; stated Bharat Biotech in response to the issue, quoted by The Indian Express. The company has an agreement to supply 20 million doses of Covaxin to the Brazilian government through Precisa Medicamentos, its partner in the country.</p>
<p>Major issues flagged include safety-related observations that the company had not validated the method of analysis to prove complete inactivation of the virus (to prove that it was killed). According to the ANVISA, considering that Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine, the company needs to ensure that the virus was completely inactivated, otherwise live SARS-CoV-2 viruses may be present in the vaccine</p>

<p>Spying an opportunity to offer an ophthalmic formulation of the anti-VEGF biologic, Outlook Therapeutics (Nasdaq: OTLK) is testing bevacizumab-vikg in the NORSE THREE open-label study.</p>
<p>Top-line results showed no unexpected safety trends, indicating a safety profile consistent with that of prior published data on the use of bevacizumab for ophthalmic conditions.</p>
