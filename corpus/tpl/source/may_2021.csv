488781,,"Look back at pharma news in the week to May 28, 2021","Clinical trials featured in last week’s news, with US company Annovis Bio seeing its market value double on May 21, when it released new data showing the potential of its ANVS401 as a treatment for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

<h2><strong>Annovis rises on Alzheimer&rsquo;s froth</strong></h2>
<p>Investors who bought into Annovis Bio following May 21 news of a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/signs-of-a-possible-breakthrough-in-alzheimer-s-and-parkinson-s"">mid-stage hit</a> in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease may have acted a little precipitately, warned Elizabeth Cairns writing on Evaluate Pharma. The company trumpeted a significant improvement in cognitive symptoms of the disease with ANVS401, and its stock leapt 127% to close at $60.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the improvement was indeed impressive &ndash; but there are several reasons why the cautious investor might have held back. The results come from just 14 patients; do not specify the dose used; and concern just one of the trial&rsquo;s five functional endpoints. Worse, the placebo-adjusted benefit did not reach significance. With a $50m follow-on offering announced yesterday at $50 per share, some newcomers are at risk of getting burned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annovis&rsquo; Phase IIa study aims to evaluate ANVS401, an inhibitor of amyloid precursor protein, tau and &alpha;-synuclein, in Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s patients. The trial&rsquo;s enrolment target is 68, but Annovis has been releasing data piecemeal. The day before the Alzheimer&rsquo;s data came out it reported biomarker data from 14 Parkinson&rsquo;s patients in the same study. In the 14 Alzheimer&rsquo;s subjects, a 4.4-point reduction in Adas-Cog11 was seen after 25 days of treatment with ANVS401. This reduction, of 30% from baseline, was statistically significant with a p value of 0.04, Ms Cairns noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annovis pointed out that this was substantially larger than reported by competitors. In the Emerge trial, Biogen&rsquo;s aducanumab managed an improvement of 1.4-points from baseline in Adas-Cog13 after a year, and in February Cassava reported a 1.6-point improvement in Adas-Cog11 after six months&rsquo; treatment with simufilam.</p>
<p>Also commenting, analytics firm GlobalData notes that while the early, preliminary data generated so far are promising and there is an established unmet need for novel treatment approaches in this space, Annovis Bio still needs to address concerns around the drug&rsquo;s ability to provide therapeutic benefits in larger Phase III trials and the expected high cost of a first-in-class potential therapy, which will impact its future market entry. Given that, GlobalData anticipates that ANVS401 will generate sales of $161 million in 2027 in the USA, if approved.</p>
<p>GlobalData neurology analyst Sarah Elsayed said: &ldquo;The role of neuroinflammation in PD has been increasingly explored over the past decade. In fact, a few companies have been investigating this approach to target PD patients at early stages of the disease, yet there are currently no available treatments that can offer neuroprotection or halt the disease progression. The announced data showed a highly statistically significant reduction in the levels of a number of different inflammatory biomarkers. As such, the advancement of ANVS401 into Phase III trials is a vital step towards providing further evidence to back up this hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData expressed that the &alpha;-synuclein pathway has been gaining increasing recognition among PD research, however, &alpha;-synuclein is mainly tested in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which adds a major difficulty in the process of collecting these samples during clinical trials.</p>
<h2><strong>NGM craters after dropping mid-stage NASH candidate aldafermin</strong></h2>
<p>Shares in NGM Biopharma have plummeted after the US biotech said it would <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ngm-bio-adds-to-woes-in-the-search-for-a-nash-treatment"">abandon development of aldafermin</a> in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), adding to a lengthening list of failed candidates for the fatty liver disease, commented Phil Taylor writing on Pharaphorum<strong>. </strong>It&rsquo;s not the end of the aldafermin story just yet however, as a Phase IIb trial in severe, stage four NASH is still ongoing and will run to its conclusion.</p>
<p>Hopes aren&rsquo;t high however, and aldafermin follows in the footsteps of a string of other drugs that have failed in NASH trials, including drugs from Gilead Sciences, Genfit, Albireo, CymaBay, Cirius and others. Biopharma companies have piled into the NASH space in recent years, lured by the promise of big rewards for the first drugs to treat a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world and is becoming more common.</p>
<p>One candidate that made it through trials &ndash; Intercept Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; FXR agonist obeticholic acid &ndash; failed at the regulatory stage when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results are certainly disappointing, particularly given the dire unmet need in this patient population,&rdquo; said NGM&rsquo;s chief executive David Woodhouse. &ldquo;The lack of significant fibrosis improvement was unexpected given the consistency of histology findings previously seen with aldafermin in our adaptive four-cohort Phase II study,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Abivax&rsquo; ABX464 likely drug of choice in $18 billion IBD market</strong></h2>
<p>According to Goetzpartners research analyst Dr Chris Redhead, first data from <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/abivax-reports-excellent-efficacy-and-safety-of-abx464-in-phase-iib"">Abivax&rsquo; Phase IIb in ulcerative colitis</a> (UC) demonstrates statistically-significant improvement in the Modified Mayo Score (MMS) the primary endpoint. The 254-patient trial including 50% of patients refractive to existing biologic or JAK therapies showed ABX464 to be effective at all doses tested (25mg, 50mg, 100mg) with a rapid onset of action detectable at day 8. Although not powered, the trial also achieved statistical significance in almost all secondary endpoints, except clinical remission at the two higher doses. With little obvious dose dependence, management indicated pooling the different dose data yielded significance for all secondary endpoints.</p>
<p>Adverse events were mild, dose-dependent and similar to placebo at the lowest 25mg dose. Data from the first 51 patients in maintenance study indicates that efficacy is sustained and increased after 12 months. These data confirm the previous Phase IIa data and open the door to a pivotal Phase III to start by YE2021E. ABX464's efficacy, safety and convenience would make the drug of choice in UC and perhaps the whole $18 billion inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) market; a strong basis for a transformative deal. Positive data from the ongoing Phase IIa study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) expected by end Q2/2021E would open the door to the rest of the $90 billion inflammatory disease market. Dr Redhead reiterates his OUTPERFORM recommendation and increases the target price to 54 euros.</p>
<p>Potential drug of choice in IBD<strong> -</strong> If the sustained efficacy seen in the Phase IIa/IIb trials is repeated in pivotal trials, KOLs expect the drug would be used at every stage of disease from first line onwards. While it has yet to be trialled in Crohn's disease, most UC drugs are also effective in Crohn's. Given the safety and convenience, this would probably make the drug of choice in the $18bn and growing IBD market.</p>
<p>Strong basis for partnering in 2021E: Funded through YE2021E, positive this positive Phase IIb data in UC alone should provide the base for a substantial partnering deal: only reinforced if accompanied by positive Phase IIa data in RA, he concluded.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Vectura marks a sorry outcome for UK biotech</strong></h2>
<p>With <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/in-brief/brief-vectura-rockets-on-news-of-958-million-takeover-bid"">Vectura&rsquo;s sale to the private equity company Carlyle Group</a> for &pound;958 million, UK investors have another reason to be down on biotech, opined Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage. Vectura, like Cenes and Vernalis before it, is the result of numerous UK biotech mergers that failed to amount to much.</p>
<p>During its 24-year existence Vectura subsumed Innovata, Activaero and Skyepharma for a combined &pound;680 million, but shortly after building this respiratory disease focus it gave up on drug development to become a service company. Its sale price amounts to a 142% premium to its 2004 IPO. Cenes and Vernalis were sold for a pittance to Paion and Ligand respectively, and UK biotech&rsquo;s shining star is probably GW Pharmaceuticals, which had to seek fame and fortune in the USA.</p>
<p>The UK still produces cutting-edge science, but the likes of Autolus, Achilles and Nightstar <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/interviews/interview-synconas-uncompromising-message-european-markets"">all chose Nasdaq to float</a>. The UK sector is left with a rump of micro caps, and even the once mighty Oxford Biomedica is now largely a services business, Mr Plieth concluded.</p>
<p>Adding his voice, Phil Taylor on Pharmaphorum pointed out that the acquisition of one of the UK&rsquo;s biggest biotech companies comes as Vectura is in the midst of a business restructuring that has seen it pivot away from developing its own respiratory therapies and towards an outsourcing model in which it provides contract development and manufacturing services to other biopharma companies.</p>
<p>Most recently, it partnered with UK start-up Inspira on a project to develop an inhaled therapy for COVID-19 based on a plant-derived compound shown to kill the SATS-CoV-2 virus in lab studies, with clinical trials due to start next year.</p>
<p>Vectura&rsquo;s efforts to develop its own therapies met with mixed results, and the company was hit particularly hard in 2018 when it&nbsp;<a href=""https://pharmaphorum.com/news/vectura-takes-40-million-hit-as-asthma-drug-fails-trial/"" data-mil=""80756"">abandoned</a>&nbsp;Phase III drug candidate VR475 for severe uncontrolled asthma, leading to a &pound;40 million hit on its finances.</p>
<h2><strong>UK regulatory review of Alexion acquisition by AstraZeneca threatens GSK, says GlobalData</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/uk-competition-watchdog-weighs-in-on-alexion-purchase"">UK regulatory review</a> of Alexion Pharmaceuticals acquisition by AstraZeneca limits the ability of GlaxoSmithKline to buy its way out of a proxy brawl with activist investor Elliott, says GlobalData, a data and analytics company.</p>
<p>Despite the acquisition passing the regulatory review from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is now investigating it.</p>
<p>GSK, the other major UK-headquartered pharmaceutical company, is heading towards a proxy fight with the activist Investor fund Elliot. Elliot has acquired a significant stake in GSK, while concerns about GSK&rsquo;s performance and the performance of chief executive, Emma Walmsley, have been growing.</p>
<p>Peter Shapiro, senior director of drugs and business fundamentals at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Elliot will push to restructure the makeup of GSK&rsquo;s drug pipeline. The easiest way to restructure the clinical stage pipeline of a company is by the acquisition of smaller more innovative Bio/Pharma companies, which is what AstraZeneca is doing with Alexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexion has a strong pipeline of orphan and rare disease drugs that will diversify AstraZeneca&rsquo;s drug pipeline. If the UK CMA resists approving this acquisition, it could make it harder for GSK to acquire smaller more innovative Bio/Pharma companies as well. This is not the only problem for acquisitions, because of the high trading value of Bio/Pharma stocks currently, companies will have to pay a premium for acquisitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interestingly, Elliot is now involved with both large British pharmaceutical companies. In 2019, Alexion management came under pressure from shareholder Elliott to be acquired, which ultimately lead to the acquisition by AstraZeneca,&rdquo; Mr Shapiro noted.</p>","2021-05-30 11:41:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 28, 2021","News reviews, Annovis Bio, ANSV401, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Aldafermin, Abivax, ABX464, Vectura, Carlyle, AstraZeneca, Alexion, Alzheimer's, NASH, Colitis","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 28, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-30 11:38:19","2021-05-30 11:55:38",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-28-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"CNS Diseases, Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Hepatology, Neurological","Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Drug Trial, Management, Research",,"Abivax, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Annovis Bio, AstraZeneca, Carlyle Group, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Vectura","ABX464, aldafermin, ANVS401",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Developed by US biotech giant Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), this is the first approved targeted therapy for tumors with any KRAS mutation, which accounts for around 25% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers. KRAS G12C mutations represent about 13% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers, the FDA noted. Amgen&rsquo;s shares closed up modest 1.1% at $237.94 on Friday.</p>
<p>The approval comes three months earlier than the previously-announced FDA action date of August 15. &ldquo;The earlier approval, and the label, also improves Amgen&rsquo;s competitive position compared to its closest rival, Mirati, by virtue of a widened time-to-market advantage,&rdquo; commented SVB Leering analyst Geoffrey Porges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mirati Therapeutics (Nasdaq: MRTX) is planning a regulatory filing in the second half of this year after posting preliminary NSCLC data on its KRAS G12C inhibitor adagrasib in October 2020.</p>
<h2><strong>Sales and pricing forecasts</strong></h2>
<p>Mr Porges currently forecasts Lumakras reaching revenue of $1.2 billion in the USA and $1.6 billion in worldwide sales in 2025. This compares to consensus of $824 million and $1.2 billion respectively. He also forecasts US peak sales of $1.7 billion (versus consensus of $1.3 billion) and worldwide peak sales of $3.2 billion in 2030 (versus consensus estimate of $2.2 billion). Also, he currently projects a list price for Lumakras of $18,576 per month in the USA and $5,692-$12,198 per month in ex-US markets.</p>
<p>""The FDA approval of Lumakras is a breakthrough moment for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer because there is now a targeted therapy for this common, but previously elusive, mutation,"" said Dr David Reese, executive vice president of R&amp;D at Amgen, adding: ""KRAS has challenged cancer researchers for more than 40 years with many deeming it as 'undruggable.' The Lumakras development program was a race against cancer for Amgen's scientists and clinical trial investigators who together have now successfully delivered this new medicine to patients in less than three years - from first patient dosed to US regulatory approval.""</p>
<h2><strong>Approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway</strong></h2>
<p>Lumakras was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is unmet medical need and a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further study is required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Lumakras.</p>

<p>The US drugmaker has stressed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it is cooperating fully with the investigation.</p>
<p>Previously, Lilly had employed external lawyers to conduct an independent investigation into certain unspecified allegations relating to Branchburg, which is one of a number of the company&rsquo;s sites that produces the COVID-19 antibody therapy bamlanivimab.</p>
<p>The review of systems at the facility has taken place after concerns were raised by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over quality-control issues, including data handling. This led the FDA to issue an Official Action Indicated notice.</p>
<p>Only in April, the FDA&nbsp;revoked the emergency use authorization that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients.</p>
<p>Based on its ongoing analysis of emerging scientific data, specifically the sustained increase of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants that are resistant to bamlanivimab alone resulting in the increased risk for treatment failure, the FDA determined that the known and potential benefits of bamlanivimab, when administered alone, no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for its authorized use.</p>

<p>Data from the Phase III ENSEMBLE study evaluated efficacy and safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in preventing moderate to severe (symptomatic) COVID-19 in individuals 18 years and older, with co-primary endpoints of 14 days and 28 days following vaccination. The data from the primary efficacy analysis showed that COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was generally well tolerated and demonstrated 67% reduction (95% CI: 59%&ndash;73%) in symptomatic COVID-19 disease 14 days after vaccination, and similar results were seen from 28 days after vaccination, in participants who received the vaccine in comparison to participants given the placebo.</p>
<p>The data also demonstrated the vaccine was 85 percent effective (95 percent CI: 54%&ndash;97%) in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed reduction of COVID-19 related hospitalization from 14 days after vaccination.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The preeminent cancer conference in the USA, this year ASCO is seeking to focus on a theme of &ldquo;doing right by the patients for whom we care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the impact of the coronavirus pandemic front and center, this means confronting &ldquo;complex forces and systems that have created disparities in cancer care, treatment, and research.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Program highlights</h2>
<p>Sorting through some 2,500 oral and poster presentations to find the most impactful, market-moving data is no mean feat.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we have looked at increasing <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/in-multiple-myeloma-more-competition-is-on-the-way"" rel=""follow"">competition in multiple myeloma</a>, <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/keytruda-lynparza-and-lenvima-central-to-merck-co-s-asco-offering"" rel=""follow"">highlights</a> from immuno-oncology leader Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK), a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/asco-2021-bristol-myers-boasts-next-gen-checkpoint-blocker"" rel=""follow"">new form of checkpoint blocker</a> from Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), and more.</p>
<p>Here, we take a look at some of the highlights from the data on show, assessed in terms of their potential to indicate a change in the treatment landscape, or the existing market dynamics.</p>
<h3><strong>Bristol Myers Squibb - relatlimab - Sunday, June 6, 8am EDT.</strong></h3>
<p>New York-based Bristol Myers has two oral presentations at ASCO this year related to its anti-LAG3 antibody relatlimab, a candidate which promises to offer a novel form of checkpoint inhibition.</p>
<p>Jonathan Cheng, senior vice president and head of oncology development, told The Pharma Letter the candidate represented &ldquo;a very exciting new area,&rdquo; adding it is now &ldquo;the third checkpoint inhibitor to show benefit in patients with melanoma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the event, data from the RELATIVITY-047 trial will outline the impact of a fixed-dose combination of relatlimab and Opdivo (nivolumab) in the first-line treatment of melanoma.</p>
<p>A separate presentation will show results for neoadjuvant and adjuvant use of Opdivo with relatlimab in resectable clinical stage III melanoma.</p>
<p>Keytruda developer Merck &amp; Co is also working on a LAG-3 blocker, favezelimab, but the company is yet to present late stage data, giving Bristol Myers a potential lead in what could become an important new treatment area.</p>
<p>In this context, also worth noting is Regeneron&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: REGN) LAG-3 candidate fianlimab. Like the others, the American firm is testing its option in combination with a traditional checkpoint blocker, Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc).</p>
<p>Both rivals are presenting data at ASCO in the form of a poster presentation on Friday, June 4, at 9am EDT.</p>
<h3><strong>Novartis (NOVN: VX) - TNO155 - Friday, June 4, 11am EDT.</strong></h3>
<p>In an oral presentation, Swiss pharma major Novartis is presenting initial results from a dose finding study of its SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, in people with advanced solid tumors.</p>
<p>The company has highlighted the candidate for its potential as part of a broad combination strategy for KRAS G12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors.</p>
<p>While the therapy is advancing in clinical trials, analysts will pay close attention to a rival option from Revolution Medicines (Nasdaq: RVMD), RMC-4630.</p>
<p>The Californian company has already conducted early-stage clinical research featuring a combo of its investigational SHP2 blocker with the leading checkpoint blocker on the market, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), and is moving forward apace.</p>
<p>In the firm's initial research, investigators have reported preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in people with colorectal cancer driven by KRAS mutations, setting up the potential for rivalry with Novartis' TNO155 development program.</p>
<h3><strong>Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) - amcenestrant - Friday, June 4, 9am EDT.</strong></h3>
<p>French pharma major Sanofi believes the early amcenestrant data on display at ASCO this year support its potential to become a new endocrine backbone therapy for ER+/HER2- breast cancer.</p>
<p>Extra attention has been paid to the program since chief executive Paul Hudson described the compound as one of his firm&rsquo;s leading growth drivers for the future.</p>
<p>Amcenestrant is an oral therapy known as a selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, or SERD, under evaluation in combination with Pfizer&rsquo;s NYSE: PFE) Ibrance (palbociclib), in the Phase I/II AMEERA-1 study.</p>
<p>In a poster session on Friday, the company will detail an objective response rate (ORR) of 34% and a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 74% in combination with Ibrance, a CDK4/6 inhibitor.</p>
<p>Sarat Chandarlapaty, medical oncologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said the early clinical data &ldquo;show that the combination of amcenestrant with palbociclib achieved encouraging antitumor activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting an encouraging safety profile, Dr Chandarlapaty added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s notable to see this kind of activity in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a clear need for new therapeutic options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanofi is not alone in pursuing SERDs, a therapeutic avenue which analysts at Jefferies believe has the potential for up to $3 billion in revenues.</p>
<p>Swiss company Roche (ROG: SIX) has been investing in this area for many years, with current frontrunner, RG6171, in late-stage testing.</p>
<p>Also worth looking out for is elacestrant, from Radius Health (Nasdaq: RDUS), which is also in late-stage testing and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) AZD9833, noteworthy for the company&rsquo;s pedigree in this area.</p>

<p>There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for CIAS and if BI 425809 is successful, it could address this unmet need in the schizophrenia market. It is anticipated that BI 425809 will be launched in 2026 in the US, says data and analytics company GlobalData.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christie Wong, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The current schizophrenia treatment landscape includes a high number of established atypical antipsychotic products that can effectively manage the positive symptoms of the disorder; however, there is a significant unmet need for novel effective treatment options for the negative symptoms and cognitive impairments seen in schizophrenia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As BI 425809 is the only pipeline drug in Phase III of development that has received BTD from the FDA, BI 425809 has the potential to become the first available pharmacological treatment for CIAS. However, BI 425809 will need to demonstrate in the CONNEX trial program a strong safety profile and efficacy in improving cognition in adults with schizophrenia. The program consists of three Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parrel group clinical trials where patients receive a daily dose of BI 425809 over a 26-week treatment period. The estimated primary completion dates for these trials are in May 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>Likely to compete with Pfizer&rsquo;s PF-03463275</strong></h2>
<p>Ms Wong added: &ldquo;Pfizer&rsquo;s PF-03463275 previously failed to demonstrate efficacy as an add-on therapy in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia when added to ongoing antipsychotic treatment. However, PF-03463275 is likely to compete directly with BI 425809 for CIAS indication due to its similar mechanism of action, targeting the sodium and chloride dependent glycine transporter 1 (Glyt1). Furthermore, both candidates are orally administered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PF-03463275 is currently in Phase II of development, with an estimated primary completion date in December 2021. As such, BI 425809 is anticipated to have the first-to-market advantage over PF-03463275.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-28 11:44:00","Boehringer’s BI 425809 has potential in schizophrenia market, says ana","Boehringer Ingelheim, BI 425809, Schizophrenia, Market, Potential, GlobalData, Pfizer, PF-03463275","Boehringer’s BI 425809 has potential in schizophrenia market, says analyst",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-28 11:43:31","2021-05-28 11:52:00",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/boehringer-s-bi-425809-has-potential-in-schizophrenia-market-says-analyst,,,,,,boehringer_building_large.jpg,boehringer_building_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Schizophrenia,Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Markets & Marketing, Regulation, Research",Germany,"Boehringer Ingelheim, GlobalData, Pfizer","BI 425809, PF-03463275",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

Nurtec ODT is indicated for adult patients with episodic migraine, eg, those who experience less than 15 headache days per month.</p>
<p>The news sent shares of the drug&rsquo;s developer, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (NYSE: BHVN) up 3% to $85.00 in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The FDA first approved Biohaven&rsquo;s Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. In February last year. Total revenues from Nurtec ODT were $43.8 million in the first quarter 2021, up around 24.8% sequentially. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total revenues from Nurtec ODT were $43.8 million in the first quarter, up almost 24.8% sequentially, and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.</p>
<p>The approved product label was also expanded to include the use of Nurtec ODT 75mg up to 18 doses/month, allowing for both acute and preventive therapy in the same patient. This new approval makes Nurtec ODT the first oral CGRP antagonist approved for the preventive treatment of migraine, and the only migraine medication approved as a dual therapy for both the acute and preventive treatment. Nurtec ODT is approved for acute treatment in all eligible adult patients with migraine, regardless of the number of monthly migraine days.</p>
<h2><strong>New indication significantly expands the market potential</strong></h2>
<p>Since approximately 95% of all US migraine patients experience less than 15 headache days per month, the new indication of preventive treatment significantly expands the market potential of Nurtec ODT and provides a new preventive treatment option for the vast majority of people living with migraine.</p>
<p>The migraine space is forecast by GlobalData to be worth up to $9 billion by 2026. This area is mainly occupied by biologics, including Novartis (NOVN: VX) and Amgen&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: AMGN) drug Aimovig (erenumab), Eli Lilly&rsquo;s (NYSE: LLY) Emgality (galcanezumab), Teva Pharmaceutical&rsquo;s (NYSE: TEVA) Ajovy (fremanezumab) and Lundbeck&rsquo;s (LUND: CO) eptinezumab.</p>
<p>Dr Peter Goadsby, Professor of Neurology at the&nbsp;University of California, Los Angeles and King's College London, recipient of the 2021 Brain Prize for his ground-breaking research discovering the role of CGRP in migraine, and co-author of the Phase III preventive study published in The Lancet, commented, ""The FDA approval of Nurtec ODT for the preventive treatment of migraine - along with its acute treatment indication - is one of the most ground-breaking things to happen to migraine treatment in my 40 years of practicing headache medicine. To have one medication patients can use to treat and prevent migraine will likely change the treatment paradigm for many of the millions of people who live with migraine.""</p>","2021-05-28 10:53:00","FDA nod for Biohaven's Nurtec ODT for migraine prevention","Biohaven Pharmaceutical,  Nurtec ODT, Migraine, Prevention, FDA, Approval","FDA nod for Biohaven's Nurtec ODT for migraine prevention",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-28 10:51:26","2021-05-28 11:01:34",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-nod-for-biohaven-s-nurtec-odt-for-migraine-prevention,,,,,,biohaven_large.jpg,biohaven_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Migraine,Pharmaceutical,"Analgesia, Neurological","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"Biohaven Pharmaceutical","Nurtec ODT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Zeposia, an oral medication taken once daily, is the first and only sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved for patients with moderately to severely active UC. It will compete with Takeda&rsquo;s (TYO: 4502) Entyvio (vedolizumab), which was approved for UC by the FDA in 2014.</p>
<h2><strong>Sales forecast</strong></h2>
<p>Bristol Myers gained the drug, approved last year for treating multiple sclerosis patients, in 2019 through its $74 billion buyout of Celgene. In a recent client noted, Cowen analyst Steve Scala estimated Zeposia sales of $150 million in 2021, $400 million in 2022 and $1 billion in 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the availability of approved therapies, there is still unmet need and an opportunity to deliver additional treatment options to help patients better manage their disease,&rdquo; said Adam Lenkowsky, general manager and head, US, cardiovascular, immunology and oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb.</p>
<p>The approval is based on data from True North, a pivotal Phase III trial evaluating Zeposia as an induction and maintenance therapy versus placebo in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC.</p>
<h2><strong>Access Support program</strong></h2>
<p>Bristol Myers said it is committed to making Zeposia accessible to the patients who need it. The Zeposia 360 Support program will facilitate access for appropriate patients with UC. This includes a co-pay program for eligible appropriate patients to pay as little as $0 for their Zeposia prescription, assistance with financial support and a program that may help eligible patients with commercial insurance to receive free medication while they are experiencing delays or issues with insurance coverage. Support for eligible patients is also available for the routine initiation assessments, such as lab work.</p>

488767,,"Tagrisso goes full steam ahead with new EU approval","Targeted therapies have been a game changer in EGFR-mutated lung cancer, with options such as Tagrisso (osimertinib), from AstraZeneca, helping to greatly improve progression-free survival (PFS).","<p>Targeted therapies have been a game changer in EGFR-mutated lung cancer, with options such as Tagrisso (osimertinib), from AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), helping to greatly improve progression-free survival (PFS).</p>
<p>Now the treatment has secured a new approval in Europe, for the adjuvant treatment of certain adults with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as defined by a biomarker test.</p>
<p>The approval, which comes several months after the US regulator gave its blessing, will enable many people to be treated in an earlier and potentially more curative stage of disease.</p>
<p>Tagrisso is already greatly overshooting chief executive Pascal Soriot&rsquo;s initial goal of $ billion in annual sales.</p>
<p>The treatment, a key plank of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s new intent to focus heavily on the high-impact field of oncology, saw sales increase 17% in the first quarter to $1.1 billion, with overall revenues in 2020 well exceeding $4 billion.</p>
<h2>New approval</h2>
<p>The recent approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from the ADAURA Phase III trial in which Tagrisso demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS).</p>
<p>The trial also showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in DFS for Tagrisso in the overall trial population, a key secondary endpoint.</p>
<p>Margarita Majem of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau said the approval would likely &ldquo;change clinical practice in the EU,&rdquo; adding the therapy has shown &ldquo;an unprecedented disease-free survival benefit for patients with EGFR mutations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president for oncology, said: &ldquo;We know the earlier a patient&rsquo;s cancer is detected and treated, the greater chance they may have of being cured, which is why this approval is significant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This amount is sufficient to vaccinate 110 million people. No indication was given as to the financial terms of the accord.</p>
<p>The supply agreement with UNICEF for Sputnik V vaccine will broaden access to help meet vaccine demand around the world. Procurement and delivery of the vaccine by UNICEF is subject to the vaccine receiving World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The decision is expected soon on the Sputnik V application for WHO EUL that was submitted in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concurrently, the RDIF will be holding a separate discussion with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to see the Sputnik V vaccine considered for inclusion in the COVAX Facility&rsquo;s Portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines. The COVAX Facility (co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO) together with UNICEF aims to help end the acute phase of the global pandemic by the end of 2021 by providing rapid, fair and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines to all participating countries and territories regardless of income level, thus enabling the protection of frontline health care and social workers, as well as other high-risk and vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev commented: &ldquo;RDIF is proud to support UNICEF and its partners&rsquo; global efforts to ensure equal and wide access to coronavirus vaccines for all countries. Vaccination is the best way to defeat the pandemic, help people feel safe, restore economies and return to normal life. Sputnik V is already used in more than 40 countries and this number keeps increasing as we continue deliveries to our partners every day. RDIF looks forward to the successful completion of the WHO prequalification process and obtaining EUL to start delivering supplies of Sputnik V through UNICEF to save millions of lives.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-27 16:13:00","RDIF and UNICEF sign Sputnik V vaccine supply deal","RDIF, UNICEF, Sputnik V vaccine, Supply deal","RDIF and UNICEF sign Sputnik V vaccine supply deal",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-27 16:12:59","2021-05-27 16:19:25",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/rdif-and-unicef-sign-sputnik-v-vaccine-supply-deal,,,,,,vaccine_sputnik_big.jpg,vaccine_sputnik_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund",Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On","Global, Russia","RDIF, Unicef","Sputnik V",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The range in performance between the top performing and bottom performing companies has narrowed, however, with all but one company having an internal rate of return (IRR) below the industry weighted average cost of capital, which is the most common discounted cash flow method to derive enterprise value.</p>
<p>In 2020, the cohort saw an increase in average forecast peak sales per pipeline asset - the amount of money a drug is expected to generate annually - to $421 million, from $357 million in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the average cost to develop an asset, or bring a drug to market, increased once more to $2,442 million, up $51 million compared to 2019 and a $1,115 million increase since 2013.</p>
<p>Between May 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020, the cohort had a total of 53 assets approved, an increase from 39 in 2019.</p>
<h2><strong>1,210 trials affected by the pandemic between March and November 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Deloitte also commissioned analysis measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trials to investigate the likely impact on future year returns. The analysis revealed that between March and November 2020, the pandemic affected an estimated 1,210 trials across the industry. </p>
<p>The vast majority of these (66%) had delayed starts or completions; and 8% were terminated (permanently stopped) or withdrawn (stopped before enrolling any patients).</p>
<p>Colin Terry, consulting partner for European Life Sciences R&amp;D at Deloitte, commented: &ldquo;We are finally seeing seeds of change in the projected R&amp;D productivity given recent progress of some novel trial designs and improvements in efficiency through the digitalization of drug discovery and development.""</p>
<p>""However, adoption continues to be experimental and not at scale across the industry, although accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic across all stakeholders and regulators. The &lsquo;need for speed&rsquo; has become all-encompassing alongside the realisation that development cycle times need to be reduced and new ways of working embraced to finally see the industry break the trends of the last decade,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Neil Lesser, principal, US Life Sciences R&amp;D leader at Deloitte added: &ldquo;While the uptick in performance is encouraging, sustaining it will require companies to continue investing in approaches that led to this positive direction. These include expanding investments in digital technologies and data science approaches, as well as increasing the use of transformative development models.""</p>

<p>In April 2020, to gain access to Vir&rsquo;s technology, GSK made an equity investment of $250 million in the US firm, whose shares leapt nearly 17% to $53.35 in after-hours trading yesterday. GSK was barely changed.</p>
<p>The product is cleared for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.</p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s advisory committee CHMP earlier this month backed the use of sotrovimab for COVID-19 patients who were at risk of severe disease and do not need supplemental oxygen.</p>
<h2><strong>Retains activity against all known variants of concern</strong></h2>
<p>George Scangos, Vir&rsquo;s chief executive, said: &ldquo;Our distinctive scientific approach has led to a single monoclonal antibody that, based on an interim analysis, resulted in an 85% reduction in all-cause hospitalizations or death, and has demonstrated, in vitro, that it retains activity against all known variants of concern, including the emerging variant from India. I believe that sotrovimab is a critical new treatment option in the fight against the current pandemic and potentially for future coronavirus outbreaks, as well. At Vir, our aim is not only to deliver a clinically effective therapy for COVID-19, but also to provide effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and potential pandemics of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

In just over a year since starting our collaboration and in less than 10 months since beginning clinical trials, we are delighted that, as of today, the benefits of this unique monoclonal antibody will now be available to patients in need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sotrovimab is continuing to be studied in ongoing clinical trials. An analysis of safety and efficacy data at day 29 for the full population from the COMET-ICE trial is expected as early as the first half of 2021.

<p>Intercept saw its shares fall as low as $13.88 in early trading yesterday, but more than recovered, up 10% at $17.05 after the bell.</p>
<p>Some PBC patients with cirrhosis who took Ocaliva, especially those with evidence of advanced cirrhosis, developed liver failure, sometimes requiring liver transplant. In the five years since Ocaliva&rsquo;s accelerated approval, the FDA identified 25 cases of serious liver injury leading to liver decompensation or liver failure associated with Ocaliva in PBC patients with cirrhosis, both in those without clinical signs of cirrhosis (compensated) or in those with clinical signs of cirrhosis (decompensated). Many of these PBC patients had advanced cirrhosis before starting Ocaliva.</p>

<h2><strong>Limited innovation in last decade</strong></h2>
<p>GlobalData managing pharma analyst Alessio Brunello commented: &ldquo;The Innovation in the pain market over the last decade has been limited to new drug delivery systems, new extended-release formulations, and the repositioning of anticonvulsant and antidepressant therapeutics for difficult-to-treat pain conditions. Despite the improvements in symptom relief offered by new treatments and delivery systems, the pain market still has significant unmet needs. Opioids remain the most effective modes of treatment. However, because of their abuse potential, they are typically administered for chronic pain conditions. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of therapeutics that provide adequate relief for chronic pain types. This has resulted in regulatory changes, with the FDA employing tighter restrictions regarding the prescription and labeling of painkillers, as well as actively encouraging the development of novel analgesics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;Chronic pain represents one of the most important public health problems in terms of the number of patients afflicted and healthcare cost. Most patients with chronic pain are treated with medications as the mainstay of therapy, yet most medically treated patients continue to report ongoing pain. Existing pain medications have significant limitations and adverse events including tolerance, dependence, gastrointestinal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and a narrow therapeutic window, making the search for novel analgesics even more important.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-27 10:20:00","Neuropathic pain market forecast to reach $25.2 billion by 2027","Neuropathic, Pain, Market, Forecast, GlobalData","Neuropathic pain market forecast to reach $25.2 billion by 2027",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-27 09:12:40","2021-05-27 10:20:52",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/neuropathic-pain-market-forecast-to-reach-25-2-billion-by-2027,,,,,,pain_med_big.jpg,pain_med_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,Pain,Pharmaceutical,"Analgesia, Neurological","Markets & Marketing, Research",Global,GlobalData,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""With the opening of recruitment for the NEPTUNO trial and a head-to-head comparator group, we will be able to know more precisely what the clinical role and efficacy of plitidepsin in COVID-19 is""</span>The APLICOV-PC study evaluated three cohorts of hospitalized patients with mild, moderate or severe disease, with three different dose levels of plitidepsin (1.5mg - 2.0mg - 2.5mg), administered on three consecutive days.</p>
<p>Of the 45 patients treated in the trial, 86.7% had moderate or severe disease. 91% had pneumonia, with 71% having bilateral pneumonia.</p>
<p>In the results obtained in this study, the data observed in 23 patients with moderate disease stand out, 74% were discharged from hospital in the first week of treatment.</p>
<p>Those who received the 2.5mg dose were most likely to be discharged during the first week of hospitalization.</p>
<p>In this same group of patients, it has been observed that the higher the dose of plitidepsin, the higher the lymphocyte count over time, an indicator of improvement of the immune system.</p>
<p>Likewise, a parallelism is observed between the decrease in viral load, clinical improvement and the fall in inflammation parameters, such as C-reactive protein.</p>
<p>This suggests that, in addition to its antiviral effect, plitidepsin could be exerting anti-inflammatory effects, favoring the immune response against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>This publication also reaffirms the initial hypotheses on the transversality of plitidepsin against other strains or variants of coronavirus, since it acts by blocking the eEF1A protein, present in human cells, which is used by different types of coronavirus to reproduce and infect other cells.</p>
<p>The data obtained in this study have led PharmaMar to launch the new Phase III NEPTUNO study, which will determine the efficacy of plitidepsin for the treatment of hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>The top-line data showed significant clinical efficacy in the overall patient population on primary and key secondary endpoints and a good safety profile of ABX464 during eight weeks of induction treatment. Importantly, the overall drop-out rate of patients in the study was only 9%, which is remarkable in view of the Covid-19 situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after 48 weeks of open-label maintenance treatment with ABX464, preliminary data from the first 51 patients showed further increased and durable clinical and endoscopic efficacy.</p>
<p>The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase IIb induction study was conducted at 130 study sites in 15 European countries, Canada and the US. It had three once-daily oral ABX464 treatment groups (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) and one placebo group. 254 patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis were enrolled into the trial. 50% of these patients had inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;) inhibitors, vedolizumab, other biologics and/or JAK inhibitors treatments while the other 50% were refractory to conventional treatments.</p>

<p>The reviewers said that the lack of treatments for delaying T1D, combined with the difficulties of operating such long-term trials made it &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to regard the single trial, together with confirmatory evidence, as &ldquo;potentially meeting the standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness.""</p>
<h2>Change in fortunes</h2>
<p>In early April, Provention stock fell significantly after the firm reported the US FDA had ""identified deficiencies"" in its ongoing review, which would &ldquo;preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agency stated that, based on the evidence it had seen, the pharmacokinetic profiles of two drug products featured in a bridging study were not comparable, and that more data would be required.</p>
<p>The advisory panel is not tasked with answering this question on Thursday, but the FDA said it was working with Provention ""in a timely manner"" to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>The latest briefing documents will raise hopes that the broader risk-benefit analysis is tipping in favor of approval, and that there is light at the end of the tunnel for the program.</p>
<p>Given a lack of options for people with T1D, analysts have estimated that teplizumab could secure blockbuster status if approved, with expectations that a course of treatment could be priced at around $100,000.</p>
<p>Chief executive Ashleigh Palmer said: ""We would like to recognize the FDA for their ongoing efforts in the review of the BLA for teplizumab and for convening this Advisory Committee meeting of key endocrinology leaders to discuss the potential merits of teplizumab as the first ever disease modifying therapy for T1D.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-26 14:59:00",,"teplizumab, Provention, type, diabetes, candidate, positive, briefing, firm, advisory, Mood, music, improves, rose, news, Jersey, related, Shares, Tuesday","Shares in New Jersey, USA-based company Provention Bio rose by over a quarter on Tuesday, after the firm announced positive regulatory news related to its type ",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-26 10:20:09","2021-05-26 14:59:07",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/mood-music-improves-for-type-1-diabetes-candidate,,,,,,syringe_syringes_big.jpg,syringe_syringes_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Diabetes,"Focus On, Regulation, Research, US FDA",USA,"Provention Bio",teplizumab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488747,,"Call for advanced therapies to be exempt from EU GMO legislation","The European Commission (EC) should exempt advanced therapies from Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) legislation, which hurts Europe’s ability to attract clinical trials and delays patient access to transformative medicines.","<p>The European Commission (EC) should exempt advanced therapies from Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) legislation, which hurts Europe&rsquo;s ability to attract clinical trials and delays patient access to transformative medicines.</p>
<p>So says the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), and the European Association of Bioindustries (EuropaBio) in a paper published online in the journal Human Gene Therapy.</p>
<h2>'Unintended consequence' of initial GMO legislation</h2>
<p>The EC recognized that GMO requirements hinder the conduct of clinical trials in its April 29 study on new genomic techniques and in the 2020 Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, when it called for GMO legislation to be fit for purpose for addressing medicines.</p>
<p>Initially, GMO legislation was primarily enacted to protect food consumers and the environment, but Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) such as gene therapies are affected as an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>The uneven application of GMO requirements across European Union (EU) member states causes significant clinical trial delays despite findings that gene therapies pose a negligible risk to the environment.</p>
<p>Galvanized by the pandemic, the EC granted a temporary derogation from GMO requirements to investigational COVID-19 medicinal products to accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments.</p>
<p>An industry survey suggested that the temporary derogation decreased the amount of time required to complete clinical trials in Europe.</p>
<p>According to the paper, a similar, but permanent, exemption is justified for gene therapies&mdash;which often treat life-threatening diseases that have few, or no, treatment options&mdash;while still preserving high quality and safety standards.</p>
<h2>'Our hopes are set on the EC to improve patient access to revolutionary treatments'</h2>
<p>Paige Bischoff, ARM&rsquo;s senior vice president of global public affairs, said: &ldquo;The EC recognized that time was of the essence when lifting GMO requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is also very much of the essence for people with cancer, inherited disorders and other life-threatening conditions. We call on the EC to take the same measures for advanced therapies and remove the unnecessary and unintended burden of GMO legislation so patients have timely access to transformative, potentially curative medicines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The organizations call on the EC to put forward a proposal by 2022, the timeframe proposed by the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe. Without an exemption for gene therapies, the GMO requirements threaten the region&rsquo;s competitiveness with other parts of the world where GMO legislation is less complex and cumbersome.</p>
<p>P&auml;r Tellner, director of regulatory affairs at EFPIA, said: &ldquo;In 2020, we welcomed the derogation from GMO legislation for COVID-19 treatments or vaccines in clinical trials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Member companies are increasingly reporting how the derogation has removed the significant and time-consuming hurdles associated with GMO submissions, in addition to the clinical trial application. Swift action to a permanent exemption from GMO legislation allows the EU to prosper and most importantly for patients to continue to receive transformative, potentially life-saving therapies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violeta Georgieva, EuropaBio&rsquo;s legal affairs manager, said: &ldquo;Freeing the conduct of clinical trials with investigational gene therapies from the heavy EU GMO administrative burden is critical for cutting-edge biotechnology companies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of CRISPR/Cas9, the latest promising tool in genome editing, can be overshadowed in the EU if developers and regulators are to follow the 2018 ruling of the EU Court of Justice, which puts the controversial GMO label on the Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR technology. Our hopes are set on the EC to improve patient access to revolutionary treatments by exempting them from the disproportionate and outdated GMO framework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In September 2020, the ICER <a href=""https://icer.org/news-insights/press-releases/icer-publishes-white-paper-on-cornerstones-for-fair-patient-access-to-prescription-drugs-launches-annual-assessment-of-us-payer-policies/"">published</a>&nbsp;the white paper: &ldquo;Cornerstones of &lsquo;Fair&rsquo; Drug Coverage: Appropriate Cost-Sharing and Utilization Management Policies for Pharmaceuticals.&rdquo; This paper analyzes the ethical and practical dimensions of insurance coverage policy, while presenting a corresponding set of criteria that will support a more transparent discussion among all health care stakeholders about whether specific policies are delivering &ldquo;fair&rdquo; patient access to prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Building on the criteria discussed within that paper, the health technology assessor convened a multi-stakeholder working group &ndash; comprising more patient community leaders than all other stakeholders combined &mdash; to advise the ICER as it undertakes this new annual initiative to assess Barriers to Fair Access within the prescription drug coverage policies of major US payers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first iteration of this annual assessment, the ICER will use <a href=""https://www.mmitnetwork.com/analytics/"">MMIT&rsquo;s market access Analytics solution</a> to evaluate the coverage policies of 15 of the largest commercial payers in the USA.

<p>As talks to reach an agreement on the waiver proceed, supporters say it will be critical for pharmaceutical companies to disclose the know-how to reproduce the vaccines since those conditions can't be easily replicated, particularly&nbsp;for the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Moderna (Nasdaq: RMNA). That disclosure could include having pharmaceutical companies providing training, technical assistance, materials and company documents.<br /> <br /> However, pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to hand over valuable trade secrets willingly, and it's unclear if they could be forced to under a compulsory license, experts say.<br /> <br /> Negotiations over the waiver will very likely hit a snag when it comes to trade secrets, according to Lisa Ferri, global co-chair of Mayer Brown&rsquo;s intellectual property practice.</p>
<p>The waiver, proposed by South Africa and India and supported by more than 100 other World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, would specifically suspend four provisions of the 1995 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, agreement requiring WTO members to enact laws protecting IP.<br /> <br /> The revised version released Tuesday said the waiver should be in force for three years. While the original version said the waiver should apply to preventing, treating and containing COVID-19, the revised version specified it was targeted at ""health products and technologies.""</p>
<h2><strong>Foreign government powers</strong></h2>
<p>One open question is whether foreign governments could have jurisdiction to force US companies to disclose trade secrets under a compulsory license, according to Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former WimerHale partner.<br /> <br /> That could be especially tricky if a US-based company doesn't have a presence in a country that wants to issue a compulsory license, since compulsory trade secret disclosure would require a company to take a certain action, such as sending employees to the country for training, Prof Contreras told Law360.</p>
<p>In countries like China, where the vaccine-producing companies have a presence, such as Pfizer, compulsory licenses on trade secrets might be easier to enforce, he said. For example, those governments could impose fines on companies that refuse to comply and seize assets if they refuse to pay up.<br /> <br /> But enforcement will be murkier when the companies don't have any assets in the countries issuing compulsory trade secret licenses. ""The US government could allow a foreign government to bring a claim in a US court, but that's unlikely,"" he said.</p>","2021-05-26 11:39:00","IP waiver talks hinge on use of Big Pharma's trade secrets","COVID-19, Vaccines, Intellectual property, Waivers, Trade secrets, Law360, Moderna, Pfizer","IP waiver talks hinge on use of Big Pharma's trade secrets",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-26 11:38:15","2021-05-26 11:46:43",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ip-waiver-talks-hinge-on-use-of-big-pharma-s-trade-secrets,,,,,,patent_innovation_money.jpg,patent_innovation_money_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"World Health Organization",Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Patents & Trademarks, Production, Public health",Global,"Moderna, Pfizer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 25, 2022. The FDA also notified the company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.</p>
<p>In February this year, the FDA approved Ukoniq for adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). According to Evaluate Vantage at that time, Ukoniq should achieve annual sales of $254 million by 2026. An FDA decision is also set for June for umbralisib in follicular lymphoma, while a bigger opportunity lies ahead with a combination with ublituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, said Evaluate Vantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by USA-based AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Swiss pharma giant Roche (ROG: SIX). It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Roche subsidiary Genentech in the USA, and commercialized&nbsp;by AbbVie outside of the USA. The drug generated first quarter 2021 sales of $405 million for AbbVie, of which $225 million came from the USA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Venclyxto&nbsp;approval is a critical step in providing new therapeutic options for patients in the EU newly diagnosed with AML who cannot tolerate the side effects of, or are ineligible for, intensive chemotherapy,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche&rsquo;s chief medical officer and head of global product development.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The approval is based on the results of two key studies, Phase III VIALE-A and Phase I/II M14-358, of Venclyxto&nbsp;in combination with&nbsp;hypomethylating&nbsp;agents in adults with newly diagnosed AML, who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Results from the VIALE-A study showed&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;plus&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;significantly reduced the risk of death by 34%, compared to&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;alone (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.85; p&lt;0.001). The median overall survival was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 18.7) in the&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;group and 9.6 months (95% CI: 7.4, 12.7) in the control group.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;combination more than doubled the complete responses (CRs), with a CR rate of 37% (95% CI: 31, 43) compared to 18% (95% CI: 12, 25) in the comparator arm (p&lt;0.001). The&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;plus&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;combination also led to higher rates of composite complete remission (CR + CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CR +&nbsp;CRi]) at 66% (95% CI: 61, 72) compared to 28% (95% CI: 21, 36) with&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;alone (p&lt;0.001). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (&ge;5%) in patients receiving&nbsp;Venclyxto&nbsp;in combination with&nbsp;azacitidine&nbsp;were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, sepsis and&nbsp;haemorrhage.</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s approval reinforces the potential of Venclyxto-based combinations to provide clinically meaningful benefits across several disease areas, including AML. Venclexta is already approved in the USA in combination with&nbsp;azacitidine, decitabine, or low dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in adults 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Venclexta/Venclyxto is also approved in the USA and European Union in combination with MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL; and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in people who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.</p>

<p>The drug was originated by US biopharma company Apellis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: APLS) and licensed to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (STO: SOBI; also known as Sobi) for exclusive ex-US commercialization under a deal that provided a $250 million upfront payment plus eligibility for a further $1.25 billion for the US firm.</p>
<p>Pegcetacoplan, which was approved in the USA under the trade name Empaveli earlier this month and with a European decision expected shortly, demonstrated statistical superiority on the co-primary endpoints of hemoglobin stabilization and reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to standard of care, which did not include complement inhibitors, at week 26.</p>
<ul>
<li>86% of pegcetacoplan treated patients achieved hemoglobin stabilization compared to 0% of patients on standard of care (p&lt;0.0001). Hemoglobin stabilization was defined as an avoidance of a &gt;1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions.</li>
<li>Mean LDH in the pegcetacoplan group decreased by 90% from a baseline of 2151 U/L [9.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)] to 211 U/L, which is within the normal range, compared to a 14% reduction on standard of care from a baseline of 1946 U/L (8.6x ULN) to 1681 U/L (7.4x ULN) (p&lt;0.0001).</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The positive PRINCE data showed that pegcetacoplan provided clinically-meaningful improvements across multiple measures that are important for patients and build on our recent FDA approval of pegcetacoplan in PNH,&rdquo; said Dr Federico Grossi, chief medical officer, Apellis. &ldquo;Combined with previous studies, these results emphasize the potential of pegcetacoplan to provide disease control for all adults with PNH regardless of prior treatment,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Secondary endpoints also met</strong></h2>
<p>Pegcetacoplan also achieved statistical superiority on several secondary endpoints, including improvements in hemoglobin levels and transfusion avoidance, compared to standard of care, which did not include complement inhibitors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean hemoglobin levels in the pegcetacoplan group increased from 9.4 g/dL to 12.1 g/dL compared to an increase from a baseline of 8.7 g/dL to 9.4 g/dL on standard of care (p=0.0019).</li>
<li>91% of patients on pegcetacoplan were transfusion free compared to 22 per cent on standard of care (p&lt;0.0001).</li>

<p>The EC nod follows a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s advisory committee, the CHMP, in March this year, the same month that Ponvory won approval from the US regulator. Analysts have forecast peak potential sales of $200 to $400 million for ponesimod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relapsing multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and complex disease that can present very differently from individual to individual, placing a heavy burden on the patient and their loved ones,&rdquo; said Professor Gavin Giovannoni, Professor of Neurology at Queen Mary University of London, adding: &ldquo;I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s approval of ponesimod as an additional treatment option for those living with relapsing multiple sclerosis - it will provide patients with additional choice when making decisions about their treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The EC approval of ponesimod is based on data from the Phase III OPTIMUM trial,<sup>&nbsp;</sup>a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled superiority study of 1,133 adult patients (aged 18-55 years) in 28 countries. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily oral ponesimod (20mg) versus once-daily teriflunomide (14mg), marketed by Sanofi as Aubagio, which is widely-used first-line oral treatment, in adult patients with RMS.</p>
<p>The large, Phase III study showed superior efficacy of ponesimod 20mg on the primary endpoint, annualized relapse rate (ARR), with a rate reduction of 30.5% (p&lt;0.001) compared with teriflunomide. Ponesimod also showed statistically-significant superiority on one of the secondary endpoints, combined unique active lesions (CUALs). Ponesimod significantly reduced the number of new inflammatory lesions on brain MRI by 56% (p&lt;0.0001) at week 108 when compared to teriflunomide.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Switzerland-based Idorsia Pharmaceuticals (SIX: IDIA), the company spun out of Actelion Pharmaceuticals which was acquired by J&amp;J for $30 billion in 2017, entered into the revenue-sharing agreement in respect to ponesimod.

<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer urgently need better solutions""</span>In the most recent read-out from the FRAME LGSOC cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) is 52%, with KRAS mutant ORR at 70%, KRAS wild-type ORR at 44% and KRAS status undetermined ORR at 0%. The most common side effects seen in the study were rash, creatine kinase elevation, nausea, hyperbilirubinemia and diarrhea, most being NCI CTC Grade I/II and all were reversible. Several patients have been on therapy for more than one year, indicating the potential for a long duration of benefit.</p>
<p>Melissa Aucoin, chief executive of the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition, said: &ldquo;Patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer urgently need better solutions due to low response rates and tolerability issues associated with current therapies.</p>

<p>Democrat Bobby Rush and Republican Brian Fitzpatrick have proposed the Long-term Opportunities for Advancing New Studies (LOANS) for Biomedical Research Act, with figures showing that more than 1,000 clinical trials remain disrupted because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The bill would authorize a federally-backed loan program for clinical trials that have received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance and are focused on finding much-needed treatments and cures.</p>
<h2>'We must use every federal avenue to restart US biomedical research'</h2>
<p>Representative Rush said: &ldquo;The accelerated development of COVID-19 vaccines over the past year has proved that significant investment in medical research and development can speed the development of cures and treatments. Millions of Americans suffering from cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and other terrible diseases cannot afford to wait for vital treatments and cures while clinical trials are disrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must use every federal avenue to restart US biomedical research and ensure that the clinical trials necessary to take basic research to the bedside receive the funding they urgently need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Representative Fitzpatrick added: &ldquo;More funding is needed for critical research, treatment, and cures for deadly diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do whatever we can to fight for patients, survivors, and those adversely affected by halted clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide a unique funding mechanism going forward to restart stalled biomedical research in the USA.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>'Reduce perennial shortage of funds for critical research'</h2>
<p>The LOANS for Biomedical Research Act proposes funding gaps caused by the pandemic without additional deficit spending and at minimal cost to taxpayers by creating a new class of investments called BioBonds. These are financial instruments comprised of loans to eligible biomedical companies and universities which have received Food and Drug Administration authorization for clinical trials advancing new treatments and cures.</p>
<p>Since borrowers are required to be able to repay these extensions of credit regardless of project success, investors in BioBonds would be those with long-term, risk-adverse capital such as pension funds and insurers, rather than venture capitalists or pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the legislation would help restart stalled biomedical research in the USA and reduce the perennial shortage of funds for critical research into diseases affecting millions.</p>

<p>NGM reported results from the 24-week Phase IIb ALPINE 2/3 study evaluating aldafermin in 171 patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH with stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis (F2/F3). The study did not meet its primary endpoint evaluating a dose response showing improvement in liver fibrosis by <u>&gt;</u>1 stage with no worsening of NASH at week 24 (p=0.55), analyzed using a dose response-driven statistical analysis plan (Multiple Comparison Procedure Modeling, or MCP-Mod). The study did achieve statistical significance versus placebo on certain secondary endpoints, including NASH resolution (at the 3mg dose) and multiple non-invasive measures of NASH, including liver fat content reduction by MRI-PDFF, ALT, AST and Pro-C3 (at the 1mg and 3mg doses).</p>
<p>This is in strong contrast to the preliminary Phase II results reported early last year, when aldafermin was seen to be the first drug to demonstrate a robust, statistically-significant effect of greater than 20% of patients achieving the Food and Drug Administration composite regulatory endpoint of fibrosis improvement and resolution of NASH versus placebo, as well as show an impressive impact on both of these endpoints independently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results are certainly disappointing, particularly given the dire unmet need in this patient population. The lack of significant fibrosis improvement was unexpected given the consistency of histology findings previously seen with aldafermin in our adaptive four-cohort Phase II study,&rdquo; said David Woodhouse, chief executive at NGM. &ldquo;However, in line with the data from that study, ALPINE 2/3 achieved statistical significance on multiple non-invasive measures of NASH at the two higher doses. That said, given the failure to meet the primary endpoint, we have decided to shift resources that had previously been reserved for a Phase III F2/F3 NASH development program toward advancing our other programs,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>NGM has steadily expanded that pipeline</strong></h2>
<p>Dr Woodhouse further commented: &ldquo;NGM is a markedly different company than when we initiated ALPINE 2/3 in May 2019, when our clinical-stage pipeline consisted primarily of liver and metabolic programs. Over the past two years, we have steadily expanded that pipeline with programs generated from our productive in-house discovery engine, and today we are also an ophthalmology and oncology company with four Phase II programs underway. We look forward to advancing our clinical programs and moving additional programs into the clinic, supported by our cash balance that was in excess of $400 million at the end of the first quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2015, NGM entered into an up to $4850 million collaboration with US pharma giant Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) to research, discover, develop and commercialize biologics including NP201, which was being evaluated for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Merck made an upfront payment to NGM of $94 million and purchased a 15% equity stake in NGM for $106 million.&nbsp;</p>","2021-05-25 11:57:00","NGM Bio adds to woes in the search for a NASH treatment","NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Aldafermin, Phase IIb, NASH, Non-alcoholic, Steatohepatitis","NGM Bio adds to woes in the search for a NASH treatment",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-25 11:56:05","2021-05-25 12:05:02",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ngm-bio-adds-to-woes-in-the-search-for-a-nash-treatment,,,,,,ngm_biopharma_large.jpg,ngm_biopharma_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Nephrology and Hepatology","Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research",USA,"NGM Biopharmaceuticals",aldafermin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Together with Californian biosimilars company Coherus BioSciences (Nasdaq: CHRS), Junshi has been developing a novel checkpoint blocker, toripalimab, which could represent a challenge to established immuno-oncology options, notably Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).</p>
<p>Marketed as Tuoyi, the treatment became the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing in China, after a 2018 nod for the second-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</p>
<p>In the USA, a rolling submission is underway in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an indication for which the therapy has secured Breakthrough Therapy designation.</p>
<p>Coherus has been working with Junshi since February 2021, under the terms of a development and commercialization deal for the USA and Canada, which could be worth as much as $1.1 billion.</p>
<h2>ASCO data</h2>
<p>In a sign of the significance of the results, results for toripalimab have been selected for discussion at a plenary session taking place on Sunday, June 6.</p>
<p>The anti-PD-1 antibody is being trialled as a first-line option for recurrent or metastatic NPC, in the Phase III JUPITER-02 study.</p>
<p>Chief medical officer Patricia Keegan said: &ldquo;Treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a specific type of head-and-neck cancer, is challenging, as the diagnosis usually occurs when the cancer is in an advanced stage and treatment options are limited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is reported that the main know-how of the new vaccine is its protection against two diseases at once: COVID-19 and influenza, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s local correspondent.</p>
<p>Natsimbio for the first time announced the work on the vaccine in March. A month later, head of Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, clarified that the new vaccine will be complex and will ensure protection against both COVID-19 and flu. He also added that the new vaccine will be single-phase. According to him, it will be registered either by the end of the current year or in early 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other details of the new vaccine are not disclosed, however, according to the Russian Forbes magazine, citing sources in the Russian Ministry of Health, the new vaccine will probably be based on technologies that are already used by Natsimbio for the production of its modern, tetravalent vaccine against influenza, Ultrax Quadri, as well as those used by the Russian Chumakov center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chumakov Center produces the so-called classic vaccines, when the virus is isolated, replicated in the laboratory conditions, and then used in a live but weakened form or in a ""killed,"" inactivated, being capable of triggering the immunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Karina Grishina, head of the Chumakov Center's coronavirus vaccine department, after receiving the fluid containing the virus, it is chemically inactivated, which takes place by adding a substance that destroys viral RNA, and the virus can't reproduce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Professor Anatoly Altstein, an employee of the Russian Gamaleya Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, who developed the Sputnik V vaccine, if Natsimbio uses a technique like the Chumakov Center, it is possible to make two vaccines based on inactivated viruses &ndash; anti COVID-19 and influenza - and mix them to receive a complex bivaccine.</p>","2021-05-25 10:48:00","Russia’s Natsimbio to develop new complex COVID-19 vaccine","Natsimbio, Complex, COVID-19, Influenza, Vaccine, Rostec","Russia’s Natsimbio to develop new complex COVID-19 vaccine",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-25 10:48:03","2021-05-25 10:54:56",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russia-s-natsimbio-to-develop-new-complex-covid-19-vaccine,,,,,,vaccines_large-1-.jpg,vaccines_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Research, Russian market",Russia,"Natsimbio, Rostec",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488725,,"Russian government to use interventions in domestic pharma pricing","The Russian government will use the mechanism of interventions in the domestic pharmaceutical market to tighten control of drug prices, according to recent statements by some senior state officials and local media, reports The Pharma Letter’s local correspondent.","<p>The Russian government will use the mechanism of interventions in the domestic pharmaceutical market to tighten control of drug prices, according to recent statements by some senior state officials and local media, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s local correspondent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of these plans, the government intends to establish a special reserve of drugs that will be sold in the event of 20% rise in prices (or more) in the domestic pharmaceutical market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2001, the Russian government has been using the interventions mechanism to regulate the cost of grain and some food products in the domestic market. An initiative to extend the mechanism to medicines was put forward last year after the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In November 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Trade announced the formation of a list of drugs that could be purchased by the government for state reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 20% growth of prices for them will provide an opportunity for regional authorities to contact the federal government with regard to beginning of possible interventions in the domestic market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, some leading Russian analysts in the field of pharmaceutics generally support the new initiative. As Sergey Shulyak, head of DSM Group, one of Russia&rsquo;s leading pharma analyst agencies said in an interview with the Russian Kommersant business paper, the idea is not new, as the national government has already attempted to make such drug reserves in the past, particularly after the beginning of bird flu pandemic. However, according to analysts, that measures did not result in a significant reduction of drug prices in the domestic market at that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other interviewed experts also remain skeptical about planned state interventions in the domestic pharmaceutical market. According to head of the Russian Association of Pharmaceutical Companies ""Inform,"" Vadim Kukava, since the Russian drug market already has a mechanism for fixing prices for drugs from the list of ""vital"" medicines the creation of a state reserve only makes sense to reduce prices in the retail segment of the market.&nbsp;</p>","2021-05-25 10:21:00","Russian government to use interventions in domestic pharma pricing","Russia, Government, Intervention, Medicines, Vital, Prices","Russian government to use interventions in domestic pharma pricing",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-25 10:20:04","2021-05-25 10:28:30",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/russian-government-to-use-interventions-in-domestic-pharma-pricing,,,,,,russia_roubles_rubles_money_big.jpg,russia_roubles_rubles_money_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"All therapy areas","Focus On, From our correspondent, Government Affairs, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Russian market",Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The first batch produced at Panacea Biotec&rsquo;s facilities at Baddi will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center in Russia for quality control. Full-scale production of the vaccine is due to start this summer. The company&rsquo;s facilities comply with GMP standards and are prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>Sputnik V was registered in India under the emergency use authorization procedure on April 12, 2021 and vaccination against coronavirus with the Russian vaccine started on May 14. As announced in April, RDIF and Panacea have agreed to produce 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date Sputnik V has been registered in 66 countries globally with total population of over 3.2 billion people. Efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6% based on the analysis of data on coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020, to March 31, 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev commented: &ldquo;Launch of production in India in partnership with Panacea Biotec marks an important step in helping the country fight the pandemic. Production of Sputnik V supports efforts of India&rsquo;s authorities to leave behind the acute phase of coronavirus as soon as possible while the vaccine will also be exported at a later stage to help prevent the spread of the virus in other countries around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This marks a significant step as we initiate production of Sputnik V. Together with RDIF, we hope to help bring a sense of normalcy back to people across the country and around the world,&rdquo; added Panacea&rsquo;s managing director Dr Rajesh Jain.</p>
<p><strong>Sputnik V effective in Manaus variant</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the RDIF also announces that a study carried out by Argentina&rsquo;s Institute of Virology of the National University of Cordoba and the government of Cordoba has confirmed neutralization effectiveness of the Russian two-dose Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine against the Manaus (Brazilian) variant and overall strong immune response after vaccination with Sputnik V.</p>
<p>The study specifically confirmed that the immunity generated thanks to vaccination with Sputnik V neutralizes the Manaus (Brazilian) variant in those who received one dose as well as subjects inoculated with two doses of the vaccine. Study also demonstrated that:</p>
<ul>
<li>65% of subjects induced IgG antibodies to COVID-19 on 42nd day after receiving the 2nd dose;&nbsp;</li>

<p>In total they can potentially benefit 200,000 patients as each of the 100,000 packs that will be available in India offers treatment for two patients, said Cipla. Financial aspects of the collaboration are not disclosed.</p>
<p>Cipla will distribute the product by leveraging its strong distribution strengths across the country. The drug will be available through leading hospitals and COVID-19 treatment centers. The Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) had recently provided an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the antibody cocktail in India. It has also received a EUA in the USA and several EU countries.</p>
<h2><strong>Treatment cost</strong></h2>
<p>In India, the product is priced at 59,750 rupees ($820) per dose for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk. In the USA, the antibody cocktail, that was developed by Regeneron Pharmaceutical (Nasdaq: REGN), is estimated to cost somewhere between $1,500 and $6,500 per treatment. Regeneron posted $262 million in first-quarter sales of the therapy.</p>
<p>In January this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) said they will purchase up to 1.25 million additional doses of the casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail for use in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to meet the federal government's Operation Warp Speed goals. The agreement has a value of up to $2.625 billion.</p>

488715,,"Signs of a possible breakthrough in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's","Encouraging signs from an Alzheimer’s study carried out by Annovis Bio doubled the firm’s share price on Friday.","<p>Encouraging signs from an Alzheimer&rsquo;s study carried out by Annovis Bio (NYSE: ANVS) doubled the firm&rsquo;s share price on Friday.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania, USA-based firm, a specialist in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), has been testing its lead candidate ANVS401 in a Phase IIa study.</p>
<p>Annovis is working on a hypothesis that impairment of axonal transport affects nerve cells in the same way in both AD and PD.</p>
<p>If correct, the approach could lead to an effective treatment in both areas, opening up a very significant opportunity to make an impact.</p>
<h2>Phase IIa trial</h2>
<p>The oral treatment is designed to improve axonal transport in AD and PD by inhibiting the neurotoxic proteins that kill nerve cells.</p>
<p>After 25 days, people treated with ANVS401 showed a statistically-significant cognitive improvement, as measured by a commonly-used test, with a 22% lift compared to placebo.</p>
<p>Chief executive Maria Maccecchini said: &ldquo;We previously reported that ANVS401 significantly increased speed, coordination and motor function in PD patients in this trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;We set up this study to measure the toxic cascade leading to nerve cell death and loss of function and its reversal in AD and PD. Since the study was powered to investigate changes in biomarker levels, not to demonstrate efficacy, we believe these results are that much more impactful.""</p>
<h2>Encouraging signs</h2>
<p>While it is still early days, the results from the Phase IIa study compare favorably with other trials in Alzheimer&rsquo;s, an area of research which has proved stubbornly resistant to progress in recent years.</p>
<p>For example, data from the Phase III EMERGE study, from Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB), showed a much smaller 1.4 point improvement in a similar test, ADAS-Cog13, after one year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Cassava Sciences (Nasdaq: SAVA) reported a 1.6 point improvement in the same test Annovis is using, ADAS-Cog11, after six months.</p>
<p>The trial is small, however, enrolling just 28 people with either AD or PD, and it remains to be seen whether the result will hold up after further testing.</p>
<p>The company plans to request a meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration to present the results, with a view towards progressing into late-stage studies in late 2021, if all goes well.</p>","2021-05-24 12:18:00",,,,,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-24 12:17:36","2021-05-24 13:52:01",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/signs-of-a-possible-breakthrough-in-alzheimer-s-and-parkinson-s,,,,,,brain_pain_head_big.jpg,brain_pain_head_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research",USA,"Annovis Bio",ANVS401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488711,,"The FDA’s commitment to secure drug distribution","The US Food and Drug Administration strictly prohibits the distribution of counterfeit, diverted, subpotent, substandard, adulterated, misbranded, and expired drugs that pose a serious threat to life. Nevertheless, such drugs continue to end up in circulation, compromising patient safety.","<p><strong>By Dr Nicola Davies</strong></p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration strictly prohibits the distribution of counterfeit, diverted, subpotent, substandard, adulterated, misbranded, and expired drugs that pose a serious threat to life. Nevertheless, such drugs continue to end up in circulation, compromising patient safety.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is responsible for all FDA-conducted investigations, including those on suspected illegitimate drugs. Additionally, it participates in several law enforcement task forces, with the FDA sometimes coordinating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other agencies in the enforcement of drug distribution laws.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>We discuss the challenges faced in drug distribution security, recent violations of drug distribution laws, and the actions taken by the FDA to secure the US drug supply.</p>
<h2><strong>Current challenges in drug distribution security</strong></h2>
<p><em>The COVID-19 pandemic</em></p>
<p>The widespread panic induced by the pandemic has created a breeding ground for drug traffickers, counterfeiters, and other agents distributing illegitimate drugs. Additionally, there has been a rise in the cases of quackery, which is defined as &ldquo;the fraudulent misrepresentation of the diagnosis and treatment of disease.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2021, a Florida family was indicted for fraudulently marketing and selling a &lsquo;cure&rsquo; for COVID-19 and other diseases; the product was actually toxic industrial bleach.<sup>3</sup> To avoid government regulation and prosecution, they marketed the product, called &ldquo;Miracle Mineral Solution,&rdquo; through a company deceptively named &ldquo;Genesis II Church of Health and Healing.&rdquo; Consumption of the product resulted in hospitalizations, the development of life-threatening conditions, and deaths.</p>
<p><em>Increased reliance on online ordering and mail-delivered medicines</em></p>
<p>Online pharmacies were popular even before the pandemic. Similarly, through a legitimate process, insurance companies and Prescription Benefit Managers have been delivering medicines to patients via the US Postal Service. Although this trend has enabled social distancing during the pandemic, regular use of these services has led to a false sense of security among patients, increasing their susceptibility to peddlers of counterfeit and illegitimate products.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><em>Patient inability to afford life-saving drugs</em></p>
<p>Rising co-payments for specialty and life-saving treatments such as anti-cancer drugs have resulted in patients struggling to afford treatment. Desperate attempts to look for affordable treatment options can lead patients into the hands of illegitimate drug distributors.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Recent violations</strong></h2>
<p>Here, we consider some recent violations that were investigated by the FDA-OCI in coordination with other agencies.</p>
<p><em>Misbranding</em></p>
<p>Misbranding involves false or misleading labeling.<sup>5</sup> In April 2021, a federal court sentenced Daniel Kevin Richards, who imported misbranded chloroquine from China in April 2020, to three years of probation and a fine of $10,000.<sup>6</sup> The drug was mislabeled as &ldquo;Boswellia Serrata Extract.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Tampering</em></p>
<p>In April 2021, a federal court in Boston sentenced a nurse to 42 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for tampering with liquid morphine intended for patients at a nursing home and acquiring the controlled substance by deception and subterfuge.<sup>7</sup> After diverting the liquid morphine for his own use, the nurse attempted to cover up the crime by replacing the medicine with saline or Benadryl, which resulted in patients receiving sub-potent treatment.</p>
<p><em>Counterfeit drugs</em></p>
<p>Counterfeit drugs are &ldquo;fake medicine that may be contaminated or contain the wrong or no active ingredient, or the correct active ingredient at the wrong dose.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;In a recent investigation of counterfeit drug trafficking, the FDA-OCI joined forces with the Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. In April 2021, the trafficker was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment&nbsp;and ordered to pay a restitution of $3,648,911.18.<sup>9</sup> He knowingly trafficked drugs with counterfeit trademarks of various pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Bayer, Eli Lilly and Company, and Roche.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>FDA policies for secure drug distribution</strong></h2>
<p><em>Drug Supply Chain Security Act</em></p>
<p>This Act aims to enable the development of a secure, electronic, interoperable system to monitor the distribution of prescription drugs in the US and eliminate counterfeit, contaminated, and other illegal products. Additionally, it directs the establishment of national licensure standards for wholesale distributers and third-party logistics providers and dictates that these parties should annually report licensure and other information to the FDA.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><em>Reporting of identified or suspected illegitimate products</em></p>
<p>Upon identifying an illegitimate drug product, manufacturers, re-packagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers are required to notify the FDA within 24 hours.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, the FDA requires stakeholders to report significant losses, theft, and falsification of prescription drug samples and requests them to report suspected criminal activity.<sup>11,12</sup> Through the MedWatch Online Voluntary Reporting Form, healthcare professionals and patients can report quality issues and therapeutic failure related to a medicine, which could potentially indicate counterfeit, tampered, adulterated, or misbranded products.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Warning letters</em></p>
<p>Upon identifying violations of drug regulations, the FDA issues Warning Letters to violators, including rogue online pharmacies. These letters indicate the violator&rsquo;s name and address, violation, and required corrective action.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><em>Improving awareness</em></p>
<p>Through its BeSafeRx campaign, the FDA educates consumers and patients about the risks of ordering prescription drugs from rogue websites and alerts them about illegitimate online pharmacies determined. Furthermore, the FDA educates healthcare providers about purchasing medicines from licensed sources through its Know Your Source program, and issues letters alerting doctors about illegitimate medicines that they may have possibly received from a rogue distributor.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><em>Securing global drug distribution</em></p>
<p>Considering the globalization of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, it is important to ensure secure drug distribution in the global marketplace. According to the FDA, many counterfeit drugs in the US originate from outside the country. Coordination with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection enables the FDA to track and prevent the entry of illegitimate drug products into the US.<sup>15</sup> In addition, the FDA has created a drug supply chain security toolkit to educate healthcare professionals, industry stakeholders, and regulators across the world regarding the best practices to prevent the exposure of consumers and patients to unsafe and substandard drugs.<sup>16</sup></p>
<h2><strong>Further steps to improve drug distribution security</strong></h2>
<p>In an October 2020 article, Peter J. Pitts, Former FDA Associate Commissioner, discussed further potential measures to improve safe drug distribution. These recommendations include the implementation of strategies for measurable demand reduction among patients and healthcare practitioners, eliminating drug-related commercial activities on the Internet, and increasing patient awareness about programs that reduce co-payment costs.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>The actions taken by the FDA indicate its strong commitment towards ensuring the distribution of safe and effective medicines during the pandemic, as well as in the future.</p>

488710,,"Pharmacological treatments for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)","In support of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) Awareness Month, we explore the pharmacological landscape of this rare condition.","<p><strong>By Dr Nicola Davies</strong></p>
<p>In support of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) Awareness Month, we explore the pharmacological landscape of this rare condition.</p>
<p>What is EDS?</p>
<p>There are 13 different subtypes of EDS, each originating from a specific genetic change and each with its own symptoms and criteria for diagnosis.<sup>1</sup> The estimated incidence of all EDS types ranges from 1/2,500 to 1/5,000. Classical EDS (cEDS), hypermobility EDS (hEDS) and vascular EDS (vEDS) are the most common subtypes, with cEDS affecting 1/20,000 to 1/40,000, hEDS affecting 1/10,000 to 1/15,000, and vEDS affecting 1/50,000 to 1/200,000.<sup>2,3</sup> Subtypes such as kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS), arthrochalasia EDS (aEDS) and dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS) are much rarer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only 12 incidences of dEDS have been diagnosed, with 30 cases of aEDS and 60 for kEDS.<sup>2 </sup>The sheer variability of these subsets has contributed to the difficulties faced in finding a treatment for the disease. Instead, pharmacological interventions are often focused on the treatment of symptoms, which include muscle pain, loose joints, muscle fatigue, overly elastic skin, frequent bruising, and benign growths on pressure areas such as elbows and knees.<sup>4</sup> While there are currently no FDA approved pharmacological interventions for EDS, a few drugs are being developed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Current treatment options</strong></h2>
<p>The current treatment options for EDS are focused more on symptom management, which involves medication, surgery and physical therapy.<sup>5</sup> EDS is a connective tissue disease and symptoms such as pain are treated with over-the-counter pain medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium), while weak joints and constant dislocations are often managed through surgery and physical therapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin/norepinephrine receptor inhibitors (SNRIs) are also frequently prescribed to EDS patients, while stronger medications are prescribed in cases of acute injury.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients with vEDS are at risk of spontaneous arterial rupture, which can make surgery quite risky. For some patients, blood pressure medication is used to maintain low pressure on blood vessels to reduce risk of rupture.<sup>6</sup> Recombinant factor VIIa has been successfully used to treat intractable bleeding in the same EDS subtype, and in one study patients reported improvement in their condition after being given vitamin C at 4g/day.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Prolotherapy</em></strong></p>
<p>Prolotherapy is considered a form of regenerative medicine and is often used as a last resort when other therapies have failed.<sup>7</sup> The treatment involves injecting a solution containing sugar (dextrose), phenolic compounds, and growth factors directly into the connective tissue to stimulate tissue growth and strengthen tendons, ligaments and other connective tissue. It can also provide pain relief. There are three types of prolotherapy:<sup>7</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth factor injection prolotherapy:</strong> this involves the injection of a growth factor to promote the buildup of specific cells (such as fibroblasts) at the injection site.</li>
<li><strong>Growth factor stimulation prolotherapy:</strong> this involves injecting low-concentration doses of dextrose into the tissue, inducing cells, to produce growth factors that help with the growth and migration of certain cell types. The cells then secrete collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins to strengthen connective tissues at the site of injection.</li>
<li><strong>Inflammatory prolotherapy:</strong> this involves injecting higher concentrations of dextrose alongside phenolic compounds such as procaine, lidocaine or sodium morrhuate into the joints. This solution causes low inflammation at the injection site, which induces migration of immune cells to the site in an attempt to restore the joint.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Following prolotherapy sessions, tissue growth is monitored using a MRI and high-resolution ultrasound.<sup>7</sup> While the individual components of a prolotherapy injection are FDA-approved, the actual procedure is not policed by the FDA and is often not covered by medical insurance. Prolotherapy advocates claim it has long-lasting benefits and can eliminate the need for surgery to fix weakened and painful joints, as well as eliminating the need for pain medication.<sup>8,9</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Innovations in pharmacological interventions</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Edsivo</em></strong></p>
<p>In December 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration granted priority review of Edsivo (celiprolol), a new drug developed by Acer Therapeutics for the treatment of vEDS in patients with a confirmed type III collagen mutation.<sup>10,11</sup> The drug is believed to treat vEDS by promoting normal synthesis of collagen in the blood vessels.<sup>12</sup> In 2015, Edsivo had received FDA Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of vEDS. Acer Therapeutics&rsquo; new drug application (NDA) was based on a Phase 4 clinical trial (NCT00190411), where 53 participants were randomized to receive either Edsivo or a placebo daily. Results showed that a significantly lower number of participants treated with Edsivo reported a ruptured artery (20% vs. 50% for placebo participants), indicating that the drug could greatly reduce the risk of serious cardiac events. The risk of intestinal or uterine ruptures were also significantly lower in participants given Edsivo (24% vs. 61%).<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA to Acer Therapeutics, the regulatory agency requested additional data from an &ldquo;adequate and well-controlled&rdquo; clinical trial that demonstrates that Edsivo can significantly reduce the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS before approval can be given.<sup>14,15</sup> The original clinical trial was deemed too small and poorly controlled.<sup>16</sup> A meeting with the FDA was held in the second quarter of 2021 and Acer Therapeutics outlined plans to collect additional data for resubmission.<sup>11</sup> However, it has been announced that the drug will be dropped if plans are rejected by the FDA or if the cost, risk and uncertainty of running additional trials does not justify the continued development of the drug.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>AR101</em></strong></p>
<p>Aytu Biopharma, a specialty pharmaceutical company, has announced a clinical trial for a drug with the potential to reduce life-threatening events in vEDS.<sup>17</sup> The drug, AR101 (enzastaurin), developed by Denovo Biopharma and licensed to Aytu, is an investigational oral compound that inhibits the protein kinase C beta (PKC&beta;) pathway.<sup>18</sup> Mouse models have shown the involvement of the PKC&beta; pathway in the pathogenesis of vEDS, and the upcoming clinical trial is expected to illustrate the drug&rsquo;s ability to reduce severe complications of vEDS.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Excellagen</em></strong></p>
<p>Excellagen is a type 1 collagen-based topical gel approved by the FDA for over 17 different types of wounds.<sup>20</sup> The gel&rsquo;s 3D matrix promotes platelet production, which leads to the release of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factors that stimulate the healing process. It also provides structural scaffolding for cellular proliferation and migration, which in turn boosts tissue growth.<sup>21</sup> Excellagen was originally developed by Olaregen Therapeutix. Generex pharmaceuticals, which is in the process of obtaining over 51% stake in Olaregen Therapeutix, has announced that it is now seeking orphan drug approval for the use of Excellagen for treating the wounds of EDS patients. While the efficacy of the gel in treating various types of wounds has been established in multiple clinical trials, the same is yet to be explored in relation to the wounds of EDS patients.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What next for Pharma?</strong></h2>
<p>One of the challenges of drug development for EDS is enrolling enough participants to carry out thorough clinical trials. Big pharmaceutical companies must look past the commercial non-viability of orphan drugs and collaborate with &ndash; or support &ndash; smaller pharma or biotechnology companies working in this area. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, significant strides in research and drug development can be made when enough resources can be collated and when companies collaborate.</p>

<p>GC Pharma in South Korea is the company&rsquo;s marketing authorization holder and distributor of Moderna&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine for the South Korea.</p>
<p>The approval is based on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the company, including a data analysis from the pivotal Phase III clinical study <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmoderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study&amp;esheet=52433711&amp;newsitemid=20210521005307&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c4efb3777e0693876aeb3b98a2aeaec9"">announced</a> on November 30, 2020. South Korea has secured access to 40 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>
<h2><strong>Deal with Samsung Biologics</strong></h2>
<p>Following swiftly on that news, Moderna revealed a manufacturing services and supply agreement under which Korea&rsquo;s Samsung Biologics (KRX: 207940.KS) will provide large scale, commercial fill-finish manufacturing for mRNA-1273, Moderna&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Upon execution of the deal, technology transfer will commence immediately at Samsung Biologics&rsquo; facilities in Incheon, South Korea, utilizing a state-of-the-art production line equipped for aseptic fill-finish, labeling, and packaging services to support the production of hundreds of millions of doses of Moderna&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine intended for the supply of markets outside of the USA starting in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This vaccine is paramount to people around the world in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and we truly appreciate our client Moderna for entrusting and choosing to partner with Samsung Biologics for the fill and finish of this important vaccine,&rdquo; said John Rim, chief executive of Samsung Biologics. &ldquo;Due to the high level of urgency in supplying the vaccine to the global population, we have set immediate action plans and schedule to make mRNA-1273 available for commercial distribution in the early second half of 2021,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Exploring collaboration with government</strong></h2>
<p>Additionally, Moderna announced two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with the government of South Korea: one MoU with the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH), an agency of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) for a new collaboration on mRNA vaccine research in South Korea; and an additional MoU with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea (MOTIE), the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea (MOHW) to explore local manufacturing opportunities for mRNA vaccines in South Korea.</p>
<p>With these MoUs, Moderna and the KNIH will explore areas of collaboration for scientific research on mRNA vaccines. The teams will engage in discussions regarding collaboration opportunities such as pre-clinical or clinical development of mRNA vaccine candidates against viruses that create a high burden of disease in South Korea. These MoUs may also facilitate discussions between Moderna and South Korea for a potential manufacturing facility for mRNA vaccines in South Korea.</p>","2021-05-24 10:21:00","South Korean approval and production deal for Moderna’s COVID-19 vacci","Moderna, COVID-19 vaccine, Approval, Conditional, South Korea, Manufacturing, Agreement, Samung Biologics, Government, MoU, Research, mRNA vaccines","South Korean approval and production deal for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-23 14:53:48","2021-05-24 10:21:37",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/south-korean-approval-and-production-deal-for-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine,,,,,,moderna_big.jpg,moderna_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"COVID-19 vaccines",Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Asia Pacific, Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On, Production, Regulation, Research","South Korea, USA","Moderna, Samsung BioLogics","COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

Further analysis of the data has revealed strong and statistically-significant activity on the key symptom of bowel habit, a potential approvable primary endpoint per regulatory guidelines. In addition, analysis of the data by geographical region shows that earlier top-line results were impacted by an unusually high placebo response in patients in the UK and Ireland, and enhanced positive signals were seen in the larger US population.</p>
<p>Single strain LBP Blautix is the first therapeutic globally to have demonstrated efficacy in both IBS-C and IBS-D. The clinically meaningful overall response rates and improvements in bowel habit in both IBS-C and IBS-D in this signal finding Phase II trial, in spite of an unexpectedly high placebo response in certain patient groups, are highly encouraging for subsequent larger studies with increased statistical power.</p>
<p>""Following the announcement of the top-line results in October, 4D pharma has been able to review the data in more detail. We have also discussed the results with internationally renowned key opinion leaders and patient groups. We are encouraged by the positive outcomes of this additional analysis, and we strongly believe that this signal finding study supports the continued development of Blautix as a novel treatment for IBS,"" said Dr Alex Stevenson, chief scientific officer at 4D pharma.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Data support continued development of Blautix</strong></h2>
<p>""The Phase II results, in conjunction with regulatory guidance and KOL discussions, provide a clear and viable path forward for 4D pharma to continue to develop Blautix to address a significant unmet need. Top-line results were significantly impacted by an unusually high placebo response in certain geographical patient groups. Despite this, the activity of Blautix relative to placebo in this Phase II study is competitive with approved IBS therapeutics. We are pleased to now share our additional positive findings following more detailed analysis of the clinical data. With the vital learnings we have gained, we are now even more enthusiastic about the chances of success in subsequent, larger, well-powered studies,"" Dr Stevenson added.</p>
<p>The signal finding Phase II study was a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It enrolled 353 patients in the USA, UK and Ireland with IBS-C or IBS-D as defined by the Rome IV criteria, and moderate or severe IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) of &ge;175 at screening (158 IBS-C and 195 IBS-D patients). Each sub-type cohort was randomized 1:1 to receive oral Blautix or placebo, two capsules twice daily, for eight weeks. The study was designed to generate signals of activity in both IBS-C and IBS-D and to define key parameters for a pivotal program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, US biotech Sarepta Therapeutics impressed with early-stage data on SRP-9001, a gene therapy candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy under development with Roche. GlaxoSmithKline reported positive results from a Phase II trial of a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine being developed with Medicago. Ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting next month, Bristol Myers Squibb last Wednesday outlined its planned presentations, with a strong focus on its next-generation checkpoint blocker relatlimab, which has implications for Immutep. Also, Eli Lilly released new data on tirzepatide compared to insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes patients.</p>
<h2><strong>Sarepta finds faith in big batch gene therapy data</strong></h2>
<p>The failure of a placebo-controlled trial of Sarepta&rsquo;s Roche-partnered Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy SRP-9001 might have erased 50% of the company&rsquo;s market cap, but it has done nothing to dent executives' confidence, noted Amy Brown writing on Evaluate Vantage. <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/early-stage-trial-shows-positive-profile-for-sarepta-s-dmd-candidate-srp-9001"">Presenting new data</a> from patients treated with commercial process material, the group's chief executive, Doug Ingram, bullishly claimed to have addressed all the issues raised when Study 102 disappointed. The setback was blamed on an imbalance in baseline characteristics in older children and lower than expected gene expression in some subjects; today&rsquo;s consistent results put those concerns to bed, investors were told last Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 13% climb in Sarepta&rsquo;s share price that day suggests that only those already keeping the faith will find comfort in these new data. Others will need to see results from a placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, which the company hopes to start towards the end of the year, after meeting the FDA in the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also commenting, SVB Leerink Research analyst Joseph Schwartz pointed out that, unlike other sponsors developing therapies for DMD that have safety issues, including SLDB&rsquo;s (OP) more recent inflammatory response, Sarepta&rsquo;s SRP-9001 that uses an AAVrh74 vector (versus AAV9) appears to have the safest program so far. Based on today&rsquo;s update, SRPT has not observed complement activation. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was vomiting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward, Sarepta will have several other chances to further redeem itself over the next 12 months, he said. While the Study 103 data are a step in the right direction, Leerink&rsquo;s thesis remains that Sarepta will need to string together multiple wins this year to regain investor confidence. Following these data announced today, SRPT plans to seek a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration with the goal of rapidly starting a registrational study &ndash; management expects this meeting to occur in mid-2021, with the trial beginning soon after. There is also the potential for Sarepta to initiate a pivotal trial with the company&rsquo;s other gene therapy this year, SRP-9003 for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy/LGMD2E. Additionally, Phase II Study 102 crossover function data are likely in first-quarter 2022, making the next few quarters all about execution &ndash; encouragingly the company ended first quarter 2021 with around $1.7 billion in cash, equivalents, and investments, positioning SRPT well for these milestones.</p>
<h2><strong>GSK&rsquo;s COVID-19 effort progresses, this time thanks to Medicago</strong></h2>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world&rsquo;s largest vaccine makers but absent from the first wave of COVID-19 jabs, confirmed this week that it has a chance of playing a role in the tail of the pandemic, commented Amy Brown on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>Two novel vaccines are now at the pivotal stage. The first is partnered with Sanofi and the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/phase-ii-success-for-plant-based-vaccine-from-medicago-and-gsk"">second with Medicago</a>, with Glaxo providing the adjuvant for both. These projects are being developed with the market for booster shots in mind. High immune response after a single dose in patients with prior infection shows strong booster potential, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline said of their candidate. Canada&rsquo;s Medicago, which released Phase II data yesterday, pointed to strong neutralizing antibody responses and the potential for a potent, adjuvanted vaccine to provide cross-protection against emerging variants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GSK also announced positive mid-stage results for its Sanofi-partnered COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In a Phase II trial, the immune responses generated by Sanofi/GSK&rsquo;s adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine were found to be in line with those measured in people who have recovered from COVID-19, the companies said in a statement. The interim results also showed 95-100% seroconversion following a second injection across all adult age groups in the trial and across all doses.</p>
<h2><strong>Immutep: BMS shows LAG-3 &ndash; PD-1 combo boosts PFS in melanoma</strong></h2>
<p>goetzpartners securities research analyst Chris Redhead commented on the implications of Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s recent news on its drug candidate relatlimab on Australian biotech Immutep. <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/asco-2021-bristol-myers-boasts-next-gen-checkpoint-blocker"">Bristol Myers announced that RELATIVITY-047</a> evaluating combination of its anti-LAG-3 relatlimab with Opdivo had a significant benefit on progression-free survival. The Phase II/III trial in patients with untreated or unresectable melanoma showed a PFS of 10.12 months with the relatlimab combo compared to 4.63 months with Opdivo alone. This is the first time a treatment regimen has shown benefit over PD-1 alone in melanoma.</p>
<p>These data to be presented at ASCO (American Society for Clinical Oncology) meeting (June 2021) are clearly positive for Australian biotech firm Immutep's partnered anti-LAG-3 LAG525 currently in Phase II with Novartis. With Immutep's eftilagimod alpha (""efti"") also showing positive beneﬁts in combination with PD-1 in HNSCC (head and neck cancer) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these new data highlight the potential of Immutep's in-house and partnered program. Additional new data from the TACTI-002 Phase II in HNSCC and NSCLC and TACTI-004 in solid tumors will be released during ASCO on June 4. With final AIPAC survival data also expected over the course of 2021E, goetzpartners reiterates its OUTPERFORM recommendation and A$0.900 target price, said Mr Redhead.</p>
<p>LAG525 anti-LAG-3 in multiple trials with Novartis, out-licensed as IMP701 to CoStim Pharmaceuticals now owned by Novartis LAG525 is in five clinical trials encompassing both solid tumours, including mBC and melanoma, and blood cancers. These studies involve the use of a variety of drugs in combination with LAG525, including chemotherapy, immune-oncology biologics, and small molecules.</p>
<h2><strong>Lilly&rsquo;s tirzepatide heads to the regulators</strong></h2>
<p>Eli Lilly will submit its dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide to regulators by the end of 2021 after the project scored today in its <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lilly-closes-up-as-tirzepatide-compares-favorably-with-insulin-glargine"">fifth pivotal trial, Surpass-4</a>, commented Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>The study, in type 2 diabetes patients with increased cardiovascular risk, found tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine on HbA1c and weight loss. More importantly, it helped demonstrate tirzepatide&rsquo;s cardiovascular safety, a requirement for type 2 diabetes drugs. A meta-analysis of the Surpass program found a 19% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events with tirzepatide versus pooled comparator data; Surpass-4 accounted for the majority of these events.</p>
<p>The go-to dose of tirzepatide will be 5mg, Lilly&rsquo;s chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, said during the group&rsquo;s first-quarter call, with the option to dose higher. If approved, tirzepatide will become the latest weapon in Lilly&rsquo;s battle with Novo Nordisk in diabetes; the Danish group ditched a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist and a glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP tri-agonist last year, citing toxicity concerns. Lilly has its own tri-agonist, &ldquo;triple G&rdquo;, which it has said could be even better than tirzepatide. Phase I data with this project, as well as results from Surpass-1, 2, 3 and 5, will feature at next month&rsquo;s ADA meeting.</p>","2021-05-23 10:49:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 21, 2021","News review, Saretpa Therapeutics, SRP-9001, GlaxoSmithKline, Medicago, Bristol Myers Squibb, Relatimab, Immutep, Eli Lilly, Tirzepatide","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 21, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-23 10:48:22","2021-05-23 11:05:08",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-21-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","CNS Diseases, Diabetes, Infectious diseases, Musculoskeletal, Oncology, Vaccines","ASCO, Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Research",,"Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Immutep, Medicago, Sarepta Therapeutics","relatlimab, SRP-9001, tirzepatide",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488705,,"FDA green light for first targeted therapy for subset of NSCLC","On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Rybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) as the first treatment for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have specific types of genetic mutations: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations.","<p>On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Rybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) as the first treatment for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have specific types of genetic mutations: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen, the approval is an important development for people living with NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations who, until now, have had no approved treatment options to target their disease. Rybrevant is the first FDA-approved targeted therapy for patients with these mutations, which are the third most prevalent acting EGFR mutations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This milestone also marks Janssen&rsquo;s first approval for the treatment of patients with lung cancer and reflects the progress it has made to develop and deliver transformational therapies to people diagnosed with some of the most complex diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rybrevant is the product of a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/genmab-in-collaboration-with-janssen-for-duobody-platform"">2012 licensing agreement</a>&nbsp;in which J&amp;J contracted with Denmark-based Genmab (OMX: GEN) to make use of its DuoBody technology platform. The Danish firm became eligible for milestone and license payments of up to $175 million for each product, plus royalties.</p>
<p>The FDA also approved the Guardant 360 CDx (from Guardant Health Inc), a blood-based next-generation sequencing test designed to detect alterations in 55 genes, as a companion diagnostic to identify patients eligible for amivantamab.</p>
<h2><strong>Precision oncology advances continue to facilitate drug development, says FDA</strong></h2>
<p>""Advances in precision oncology continue to facilitate drug development, allowing diseases like lung cancer to be subset into biomarker-defined populations appropriate for targeted therapies,"" said Dr Julia Beaver, chief of medical oncology in the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence and acting deputy director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""With today's approval, for the first time, patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations will have a targeted treatment option,"" she noted.</p>
<p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality for both men and women. For 2021, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that there will be 235,760 lung cancer cases, equating to 12.4% of new cancer cases but 21.7% of cancer deaths.</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing </strong></h2>
<p>Researchers evaluated Rybrevant's efficacy in a study of 81 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The main outcome measured was overall response rate (proportion of patients whose tumor is destroyed or reduced by a drug). In the trial population in which all patients received Rybrevant, the overall response rate was 40%. The median duration of response was 11.1 months, with 63% of patients having a duration of response of 6 months or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This review was conducted under&nbsp;<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3172413-1&amp;h=2427925446&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fabout-fda%2Foncology-center-excellence%2Fproject-orbis&amp;a=Project+Orbis"">Project Orbis</a>,&nbsp;an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.

<p>In the trial results, tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population when compared to chemotherapy alone, as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). The safety profile of tislelizumab was consistent with its known risks, with no new safety signals identified with the addition of chemotherapy, said BeiGene, whose shares closed up 4.6% at HK$205.80.</p>

<p>BeiGene plans to discuss these data with health authorities and present data at an upcoming medical conference.</p>
<h2><strong>Partnered with Novartis</strong></h2>
<p>In January 2021, BeiGene and Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) entered into a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/novartis-buys-rights-to-beigene-s-checkpoint-inhibitor"">collaboration and license agreement</a> granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, Japan and other ex-China markets, in exchange for an upfront payment of $650 million plus royalties and milestone payments of up to $1.55 billion.</p>
<p>BeiGene has now been paid twice for tislelizumab; it previously had a deal with Celgene but this was terminated in 2019 following that group&rsquo;s takeover by Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY).

<p>US biotech Arcutis Biotherapeutics (Nasdaq: ARQT) announced new data from its pivotal DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 studies on the topical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor at the EADV Spring Symposium.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Roflumilast would be Arcutis&rsquo; first agent to market and will compete with agents coming from pharmaceutical stalwarts such as AbbVie and Johnson &amp; Johnson""</span>Tiffany Chan, immunology analyst at GlobalData, said: &ldquo;In the announced clinical trial results, roflumilast cream was generally safe and well tolerated. In fact, 90% of patients within the randomized roflumilast treatment arm completed a full eight weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, while such a favorable safety and efficacy profile is promising, the drug may still face logistical hurdles establishing itself in the crowded PsO disease space. If approved in PsO, roflumilast would be the second PDE4 inhibitor to market, following Amgen&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: AMGN) Otezla (apremilast), which is set to lose patent protection in 2028.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GlobalData anticipates that roflumilast will launch in 2022 across the seven major markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike Otezla, roflumilast is a topical cream. The current standard topical therapies for PsO are corticosteroids, a class that has not seen innovations since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Arcutis will likely position roflumilast as a first-line therapy, prior to the use of injectable biologics. The addition of a new topical product would likely be an easy transition for mild and moderate patients who are already accustomed to using topical corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Ms Chan added: &ldquo;However, roflumilast is entering an increasingly crowded and competitive field with numerous existing branded agents, as well as several generics and biosimilars set to launch in the next decade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roflumilast would be Arcutis&rsquo; first agent to market and will compete with agents coming from pharmaceutical stalwarts such as AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - companies that are already well established in the PsO market with prescribers and payers.</p>

<p>Sotrovimab is under development at UK pharma major GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and USA-based partner Vir Biotechnology (Nasdaq: VIR).</p>
<p>The opinion relates to the use of sotrovimab (previously VIR-7831) for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40kg) with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CHMP opinion under Article 5(3) can now be considered by the national authorities in European Union member states when taking evidence-based decisions on the early use of the medicine prior to marketing authorization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CHMP reached its opinion following a review of data including an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase III COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which evaluated sotrovimab as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization.</p>

Final decisions on approval will be announced by the European Commission, which usually occurs within two or three months.</p>
<p>The Committee recommended granting a marketing authorization for <strong>Skysona</strong> (elivaldogene autotemcel), from US biotech bluebird bio (Nasdaq: BLUE), for the treatment of early cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) for patients without a matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell donor. As Skysona is a gene therapy, the CHMP&rsquo;s positive opinion is based on an assessment by the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT).</p>
<p>The Committee adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for <strong>Bylvay</strong> (odevixibat), from US firm Albireo Pharma (Nasdaq: ALBO), for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged six months or older, and could be the first non-surgical treatment for this rare disease if it gains final approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Imcivree </strong>(setmelanotide), from Rhythm Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: RYTM), was granted a positive opinion by the Committee for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetic deficiencies of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) pathway.</p>
<p><strong>Klisyri</strong> (tirbanibulin mesylate), from Spanish drugmaker Almirall (ALM: MC), was granted a positive opinion for the field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. Treatment is a critical aspect of the disease as it may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).</p>
<p>The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for <strong>Ozawade</strong> (pitolisant), from French drugmaker Bioproject Pharma, for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnoea.</p>
<p>The Committee adopted a positive opinion for<strong> Ryeqo</strong> (relugolix/estradiol/norethisterone acetate), from Hungary&rsquo;s largest drugmaker Gedeon Richter (RICHT: HB), for the treatment of symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age.</p>
<p>German pharma major Bayer&rsquo;s (BAYN: DE) <strong>Verquvo</strong> (vericiguat) was granted a positive opinion by the Committee for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure in adult patients with reduced ejection fraction.</p>

<p>Tirzepatide led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline across all three doses compared to titrated insulin glargine. For the efficacy estimand, the highest dose of tirzepatide led to an A1C reduction of 2.58% reduced body weight by 11.7kg compared to results for those treated with insulin glargine at 52 weeks.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""These strong results reinforce our belief that tirzepatide has the potential to be an exciting treatment for people living with type 2 diabetes""</span>The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class in this patient population. Gastrointestinal side effects were the most commonly reported adverse events, usually occurring during the escalation period and then decreasing over time.</p>
<p>SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest trial of the program to date and is the fifth and final global registration study for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes to be completed. The study completion was driven by the accrual of major adverse CV events in order to meet the regulatory submission requirements for evaluating CV risk for type 2 diabetes therapies.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint was measured at 52 weeks, and many participants continued treatment beyond this point, some up to two years.</p>
<p>Tirzepatide is an investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates the actions of the GIP and GLP-1 incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>John Doupis, senior investigator for SURPASS-4, said: &ldquo;Tirzepatide delivered impressive results in this study, providing superior A1C reductions compared to insulin glargine &ndash; as well as the addition of significant weight loss &ndash; in people with type 2 diabetes who have increased CV risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition that requires personalized approaches to treatment, and results from SURPASS-4 demonstrate the potential of tirzepatide to be an important option to help reduce A1C and weight for people with type 2 diabetes on one or up to three oral medicines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike Mason, president, Lilly Diabetes, said: &ldquo;These strong results reinforce our belief that tirzepatide has the potential to be an exciting treatment for people living with type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>The new storage conditions extend the length of time the thawed vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures from five days to 31 days,</p>
<p>The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, now dubbed Comirnaty in Europe, which was the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by the UK regulator in December last year, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures until use. The changes, that extend the shelf-life once thawed, are therefore expected to make storage easier and possible for a wider range of health facilities.</p>
<p>The change was approved following the MHRA&rsquo;s detailed review of additional stability data submitted to the regulator by Pfizer.</p>
<p>Dr June Raine, the MHRA chief executive, said: &ldquo;We are pleased to confirm that, having rigorously assessed the additional data submitted to us by the company, we have now approved more flexible storage conditions for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Up until now, the Pfizer vaccine had to be administered within five days of being removed from ultra-low temperature freezers. Now that the jab can be stored at normal fridge temperatures for up to 31 days, it can be used in a wider range of healthcare settings, giving patients greater access to the Pfizer vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Similar decision from EMA</strong></h2>
<p>The MHRA announcement follows one on Monday from the European Medicines Agency, which likewise approved more flexible storage conditions for Comirnaty &ndash; extending the storage period of unopened thawed vials in a +2-8C fridge from five days to 31.</p>
<p>The change was approved following assessment of additional stability study data submitted to EMA by the marketing authorization holder, ie, BioNTech. Increased flexibility in the storage and handling of the vaccine is expected to have a significant impact on planning and logistics of vaccine roll-out in EU member states, the EMA noted.</p>","2021-05-21 14:55:00","Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf-life extended to 31 days","Pfizer, BioNTech, COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, Comirnaty, Storage, Self-life, EMA, MHRA","Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf-life extended to 31 days",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-21 14:53:49","2021-05-21 15:05:20",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-shelf-life-extended-to-31-days,,,,,,biontech_vaccine_large.jpg,biontech_vaccine_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation","Europe, Germany, UK, USA","BioNTech, Pfizer, The European Medicines Agency","BNT162b2, Comirnaty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488694,,"Strategic reorganization, increased investment reaffirm Daiichi Sankyo’s long-term oncology goals","Japanese pharma major Daiichi Sankyo received a major headway in the global oncology space with the launch of its first antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan).","<p>Japanese pharma major Daiichi Sankyo (TYO: 4568) received a major headway in the global oncology space with the launch of its first antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan).</p>
<p>In addition to the strong ADC follow-up pipeline, the establishment of a new unified oncology business unit aligning the USA and European Union markets and increased investment in ADC R&amp;D will likely bolster its global oncology footprint, says data and analytics company GlobalData.</p>
<p>Enhertu, which was already approved in Japan in September 2020, received US Food and Drug Administration approval for its second indication gastric cancer in January 2021. It was initially approved for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in the USA, Japan and in the EU in December 2019, March 2020 and January 2021, respectively. It is being further evaluated in nine registrational trials for additional HER2 cancer indications, including breast, gastric and lung cancers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Other ADCs in development</strong></h2>
<p>Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd, DS-1062) and patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd, U3-1402), both in Phase II, are the other two major ADCs. There are five other DXd-ADCs and additional second-generation ADCs, new concept ADCs, bispecific antibodies, gene and cell therapies in Daiichi Sankyo&rsquo;s oncology pipeline.</p>
<p>Sasmitha Sahu, pharma analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Daiichi Sankyo got a strategic breakthrough with Enhertu becoming the fastest FDA approved biologic in oncology through the accelerated approval program within two months of submission based on its registrational Phase II study data. Although its current oncology foundation is based on three highly potential ADCs, including trastuzumab, it is trying to build up new growth drivers by conducting additional lifecycle management studies and diversifying its pipeline to gain a &lsquo;competitive advantage in oncology&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Five-year business plan</strong></h2>
<p>Daiichi Sankyo established a new oncology business unit in April 2021. Subsequently, the company announced in its five-Year Business Plan (FY2021‒FY2025) that it expects to achieve a target of 1.6 trillion yen ($14 billion), including 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) by fiscal year 2025. It aims to achieve this by increasing its oncology product share over non-oncology products to 95% and 45% in the US and EU markets, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategic targets outlined in the 2016-2020 5-Year Business Plan were achieved with the international market entry of its first ADC therapy Enhertu in 2020.</p>
<p>Ms Sahu adds: &ldquo;Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise unit was involved in its ADC oncology pipeline advancement through strategic planning and prioritization. The new business unit establishment will now deal with the commercial aspects of the oncology businesses following product launches, mainly in the US and EU markets where it expects to gain significant market share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company will invest over 1.5 trillion yen in its three ADCs through 2025. It has also invested 15 billion yen in manufacturing facilities for ADCs.</p>
<p>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center, Daiichi Sankyo ranks second in Japan in terms of R&amp;D investment while it is the fifth largest company in Japan in terms of revenue with an annual revenue of $9 billion in FY2020.</p>
<h2><strong>Deals with AstraZeneca and Seagen</strong></h2>
<p>Daiichi-Sankyo has entered into a new co-development and collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) for datopotamab and a clinical trial collaboration for patritumab and osimertinib combination in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Lately, Daiichi Sankyo is facing litigation with Seagen (Nasdaq: SGEN) over its ADC technology.</p>
<p>Ms Sahu concludes: &ldquo;Building on the successful outcomes for trastuzumab (Enhertu) collaboration with AstraZeneca, Daiichi-Sankyo is trying to expand its global outreach by entering into a further series of collaborations with AstraZeneca, which is one of the top global oncology players. Barring offsets caused by litigation, augmented R&amp;D and manufacturing investments, and strategic alliances will collectively drive Daiichi Sankyo&rsquo;s oncology revenues.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-21 11:14:00","Strategic reorganization, increased investment reaffirm Daiichi Sankyo","Daiichi Sankyo, Reorganization, Investment, Goals, Oncology, Five-year plan, Enhertu, Datopotamab deruxtecan, Patritumab deruxtecan, GlobalData","Strategic reorganization, increased investment reaffirm Daiichi Sankyo’s long-term oncology goals",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-21 11:06:14","2021-05-21 11:16:44",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/strategic-reorganization-increased-investment-reaffirm-daiichi-sankyo-s-long-term-oncology-goals,,,,,,daiichi-hq.jpg,daiichi-hq-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,Oncology,"Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Financial, Management, Research",Japan,"Daiichi Sankyo","datopotamab deruxtecan, Enhertu, patritumab deruxtecan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>&ldquo;Locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers are aggressive tumor types that often require multiple approaches to address the disease, including chemotherapy, radiation and surgery,&rdquo; said Dr Ronan Kelly, director, Baylor Scott &amp; White Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center, and W W Caruth Jr Endowed Chair of Immunology at Baylor University Medical Center. &ldquo;Even after neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery, there may be a high risk of recurrence for patients who do not achieve a pathologic complete response. In the CheckMate -577 trial, we saw a doubling in median disease-free survival compared to placebo, which suggests that Opdivo could become a new standard of care for these patients. This is exciting news, providing renewed hope,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esophageal and GEJ cancer patients with residual pathologic disease following neoadjuvant CRT and complete resection face a high risk of disease recurrence; however, the predominant option for these patients has been surveillance,&rdquo; said Adam Lenkowsky, senior vice president and general manager, US, Cardiovascular, Immunology, Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb, adding: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s news marks an important step for patients as well as meaningful progress toward our commitment to pioneering immunotherapy treatment options in&nbsp;earlier stages of disease where there is the potential to reduce the risk of recurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This application was reviewed under the FDA&rsquo;s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. The review was also conducted under the FDA&rsquo;s Project Orbis initiative, which enabled concurrent review by the health authorities in Australia, Canada and Switzerland.</p>","2021-05-21 10:34:00","FDA approves Opdivo for resected esophageal or GEJ cancer","Bristol Myers Squibb, Opdivo, Indication, Cancer, Esophageal, Gastroesophageal junction, GEJ","FDA approves Opdivo for resected esophageal or GEJ cancer",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-21 10:29:26","2021-05-21 10:36:47",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-opdivo-for-resected-esophageal-or-gej-cancer,,,,,,opdivo__bristol-myers_large-1-.jpg,opdivo_bristol-myers_small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Immuno-oncology,"Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"Bristol-Myers Squibb",Opdivo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488692,,"What do Amazon and Netflix have in common with pharma’s HCP engagement model? More than you think","AJ Ploszay, vice president of digital strategy, IQVIA, provides an Expert View on how the precedent for consumer buying set by companies like Amazon, further accelerated by the digital buying trends driven by COVID-19, are influencing a similar shift in the commercial pharma space.","<p><em>AJ Ploszay, vice president of digital strategy, IQVIA, provides an Expert View on how the precedent for consumer buying set by companies like Amazon, further accelerated by the digital buying trends driven by COVID-19, are influencing a similar shift in the commercial pharma space.</em></p>
<p>Amazon has redefined the buyer experience of virtually all consumers. A single source is expected to provide any product imaginable to any doorstep, within days, with the click of a button.</p>
<p>Netflix has equally changed the entertainment industry by providing on demand access to the latest content, making recommendations for new shows that may be of interest based on prior activity. What do these trends have to do with the pharmaceutical industry? It is all connected. Health care providers (HCPs), who are consumers in their own right, have come to expect the same contextually rich, personalized customer experience they get in their personal lives from their pharmaceutical partner &ndash; and they want it easily accessible on their phones and computers.</p>
<h2>The importance of personalized HCP engagements</h2>
<p>There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of information being pushed to HCPs by pharmaceutical companies across digital channels, making it imperative to identify ways to stand out. The old standby of pushing out volumes of information to the broadest group of HCPs to gain adoption is no longer viable.</p>
<p>Sending personalized and relevant content is key to high engagement. Many large global enterprises are challenged not only by communicating across sales and marketing silos within their own organizations, but also by streamlining communication so customers receive a harmonized and relevant message from different departments in a coordinated manner. Technology is becoming the critical tool for sales representatives to successfully engage based on insight. Operationalizing analytics throughout the enterprise to deliver the most relevant message on the best channel at the most opportune time is paramount. This is just one way that technology can help pharmaceutical companies deliver positive and successful engagements with HCPs.</p>
<h2>Optimizing HCP engagements</h2>
<p>Since pharmaceutical sales representatives have a brief window of time with which they can connect with HCPs, it is essential that the message they are sending resonates with their audience based on current needs and historical behaviors. Consumers and business professionals alike receive a lot of junk email these days and are learning to ignore noise and spam in their inboxes. Failing to take a strategic approach to digital HCP engagements is a surefire way to end up in the junk or deleted folder. For digital engagements to be effective, representatives must ensure that interactions are not only personalized, but also contextually relevant.</p>
<p>Modern technology learns over time what the HCP is looking for, much like Netflix recommends new content based on the past viewer activity. These learnings translate to actionable recommendations for representatives surrounding what action, communication channel, and piece of information will best resonate with their HCP customers for their next interaction. Other demographic information from HCPs can also be used to optimize engagements. For example, geo-location data can be used to optimize call patterns for a representative during a day of planned meetings based on the time zones their customers are in. This way, calls are made during business hours for both the HCP and the representative, including where to make an additional stop if time opens up due to schedule changes.</p>
<p>In this manner, technology increases productivity of sales representatives by providing recommendations and suggestions to improve their HCP engagement, while simultaneously automating less urgent tasks.</p>
<h2>Connecting compliantly with HCPs</h2>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies are required to adhere to stringent communications guidelines on how they talk about their products with HCPs, sharing only approved information. They must also get approval and document any engagements with key opinion leaders (KOLs), as well as report associated payment.</p>
<p>As representatives connect HCPs with the right content and scientific experts, they are keenly aware of these guidelines surrounding every communication they and other experts have with customers. Without a layer of protection as representatives lean more into digital practices, companies could find themselves out of regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies are moving to digital and virtual customer engagement platforms as well, such as social media, automated assistants, and live chat functions. These channels all need to be compliant with regulatory and data privacy requirements. There is a delicate but vital balance where organizations must deliver an exceptional customer experience designed so that regulatory-approved data and information can flow easily while ensuring appropriate firewalls are in place to protect information.</p>
<p>For this reason, companies require solutions that are uniquely built for this complex industry. Their tools must be able to keep up with the real-time rules of information sharing as they change and centralize the communication and coordination of all HCP interaction processes. It is also important that they have partners that not only have expertise in developing and deploying digital solutions but a deep understanding of the ins and outs of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Keeping up with consistently changing global transparency legislation, regulations and codes is a major challenge for life sciences companies of any size. By injecting real-time information collection into their digital strategy, any organization can easily achieve global coverage, compliance monitoring, and upstream data validation to keep pace with these changes while delivering personalized and relevant interactions. All this, without placing significant burden on their representatives.</p>
<h2>The future of the HCP engagement model</h2>
<p>In the same way that consumer entertainment preferences evolve over time, commercial content must also change to keep HCPs engaged in the manner they are accustomed to today. When broadcast television was first introduced, it was a life-changing development for the amount and type of content everyday consumers could experience. Today&rsquo;s streaming platforms and on-demand services like Netflix and Prime Video have raised consumers&rsquo; standards for how they spend their time watching and when they watch it.</p>
<p>The same is true for scientific information that for so long had been shared in black and white flat file format. It&rsquo;s not unrealistic to expect that as we evolve to consume all content in smaller bites, HCPs want to extract, retain, and reference the important information in a given piece of content more quickly and easily. The next major opportunity for curated content evolution will be for pharmaceutical teams to infuse content formats with creative tweaks to make it more dynamic and compelling for those who need to digest it. This could include new technologies such as augmented or virtual reality, or even simple interactive &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; type content that presents HCPs with only the most critical information for their current predicament.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are finding their way into mainstream business applications and processes, even in the historically change-averse life sciences sector. When embedded in workflow technologies, companies benefit from the insights surfaced to make smarter decisions and predictions to yield the best possible outcomes from customer engagements. As new technologies emerge, interoperability will be key to get the most impact across digital investments. And as care and medicine as we know it evolves to a more patient-centric model, there is no doubt that the &lsquo;blue sky thinking&rsquo; of digital customer experience innovators will continue to shape progress in the industry and redefine HCP engagement for the foreseeable future.</p>","2021-05-20 18:00:00",,"digital, HCPs, companies, information, content, pharmaceutical, engagements, representatives, Amazon, buying, engagement, time, Netflix, based, personalize","AJ Ploszay, VP of digital strategy, IQVIA, provides an Expert View on how the precedent for consumer buying set by companies like Amazon, further accelerated by",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-20 17:39:28","2021-05-24 13:24:38",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/what-do-amazon-and-netflix-have-in-common-with-pharma-s-hcp-engagement-model-more-than-you-think,,,,,,amazon_big.jpg,amazon_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Digital Pharma, Expert View, Focus On, Health Medical Pharma, In Depth",,"IQVIA INC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Trade-named Trikafta in the USA, Kaftrio is Vertex&rsquo; newest cystic fibrosis drug, which treats 90% of patients with the lung disease, and its sales surged 123% to $1.19 billion in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>If approved, this will extend the indication for the triple combination therapy to children ages six through 11 years old in European Union countries, Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The applications are supported by positive results from a global Phase III open-label study over 24 weeks that evaluated the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor plus ivacaftor in 66 children ages six through 11 years old who have either two copies of the <em>F508del</em> mutation or one copy of the <em>F508del </em>mutation and one minimal function mutation.</p>
<p>The applications will now be reviewed by the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the UK MHRA, each of which will issue an opinion regarding the potential approval for these patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to working diligently with global regulators to expand the indication for our medicine such that younger people living with CF will also be able to access the triple combination therapy,&rdquo; said Nia Tatsis, executive vice president, chief regulatory and quality officer, adding: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s news is an important milestone in broadening our access worldwide and we are pleased that we were able to file with the EMA and the MHRA in parallel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In April 2021 the European Commission granted approval of the label extension for Kaftrio in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150mg for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients ages 12 years and older who have at least one <em>F508de </em>mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

<p>Unveiled by Russian pharmaceutical company R-Pharm Group, in May 2021, the findings were presented to the British Society of Rheumatology Annual Conference on April 26-28, 2021 &ndash; with Prof Eugen Feist from Helios Clinic Fachklinik Vogelsang-Gommern, Germany introducing the data on CREDO 2 and CREDO 3 to the general audience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Treatment with olokizumab was well tolerated and consistent with the established safety profile of anti-interleukin (IL)-6 agents. The drug showed significant improvements to the signs and symptoms of RA patients compared to those in the placebo and methotrexate group, not only in biologically na&iuml;ve patients, but also among the difficult to treat population with active RA inadequately controlled by TNF-&alpha; inhibitor therapy.</p>
<p>In 2013, Belgium&rsquo;s leading pharma company UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) granted a world-wide exclusive license to R-Pharm for olokizumab, based on an undisclosed upfront payment from the Russian drugmaker, and entitlement to receive payments on development and commercialization milestones and royalties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2020, we successfully completed the Phase III clinical program, so we are delighted to share at the conference with the medical community data from two key registrational trials. Having invested over seven years in ensuring the proven efficacy and safety of olokizumab, we are now approaching preparations for global filing: to address the medical needs of patients with RA,"" commented R-Pharm chief medical officer Mikhail Samsonov.</p>
<h2><strong>European and US regulatory filings planned</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the findings, R-Pharm says it will seek marketing authorization of olokizumab in Europe and the USA.</p>
<p>Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine. It targets the IL-6 ligand rather than the receptor, and selectively blocks the final assembly of the signalling complex. It is the first direct inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) authorized for commercial use for this indication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the results of CREDO 3, Russia&rsquo;s Ministry of Health approved a new indication to be included in the Artlegia (olokizumab) SmPC. Now the medication is approved, in combination with methotrexate, for adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in case of insufficient efficacy of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, in addition to initial indication of RA treatment after methotrexate failure.</p>

<p>Regulatory changes continue to cause significant uncertainty for the sector but the UK government&rsquo;s initiatives, such as the Medicines and Medical Devices Act, provide much-needed opportunities to shape the environment for innovative healthcare following Brexit, the survey found.</p>
<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s report, Brexit and the Healthcare Industry &ndash; 2021, reveals that a total of 64% of US and 56% of UK healthcare industry professionals were positive about the UK remaining an attractive destination for healthcare research and manufacturing post-Brexit.</p>
<p>In contrast, the respondents from Europe&mdash;excluding the UK&mdash;were more negative, with only 24% of the respondents believing that the UK could be an attractive market. The table below reflects the findings.</p>
<p><img title=""unnamed-1--1.png"" src=""/media/project_tpl/image/unnamed-1--1.png"" alt=""unnamed-1--1.png"" width=""800"" height=""428"" /></p>
<p>Urte Jakimaviciute, senior director of market research at GlobalData, said: &ldquo;Compared to 2018 and 2019 survey results, the percentage of the US and UK respondents who believed that the UK would continue to be an attractive destination for healthcare research and manufacturing post-Brexit, increased by more than 10% in 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shift may have been influenced by the finalization of the UK-European Union Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), the UK government&rsquo;s attempts to create legislative framework to promote the pharmaceutical sector and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&rsquo;s intentions to join the US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s coordinated Project Orbis, which is a global program to speed up patient access to innovative cancer treatments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though the vast majority of the respondents from Europe remained negative, their positivity also increased by 10% since 2019. This suggests that the UK-EU TCA provided some confidence in the UK healthcare sector post-Brexit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same survey, the majority of respondents across all regions highlighted that reducing barriers to UK-EU collaboration on clinical research, followed by close alignment to the EU&rsquo;s drug approval system, would be the top two initiatives that could help the UK&rsquo;s pharmaceutical industry to succeed post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Ms Jakimaviciute said: &ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of clinical research and its vital role in improving healthcare. It also showed that scientific innovation requires cross-nation collaboration, unrestricted access to information, and human resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any prospects of the UK-EU divergence on clinical trials regulation may compromise UK inclusions in multinational clinical trials. It is particularly important for research related to rare diseases and pediatric clinical trials, where patient populations are limited or strictly defined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 is aimed at boosting the UK&rsquo;s healthcare industry by supporting the availability and facilitating the access to medicines. The Act also supports new regulation for novel therapies, clinical trials, and makes provisions for the use of innovations in healthcare, such as artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Ms Jakimaviciute said: &ldquo;Even though separation from the EU may allow the UK to create a more efficient regulatory strategy, the UK will need to find a sustainable balance if the country wants to keep close alignment with the EU, while moving toward its own independent, commercially viable, and competitive regulatory regime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Medicines and Medical Devices Act presents both challenges and opportunities for the UK healthcare sector. The UK&rsquo;s ability to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risks will be crucial to determine the future of the country&rsquo;s life sciences industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The firm has already released top-line results from the RELATIVITY-047 trial, revealing a fixed-dose combination of LAG-3 blocker relatlimab and Opdivo (nivolumab) met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), in the first-line treatment of melanoma.</p>
<p>Jonathan Cheng, senior vice president and head of oncology development, describes relatlimab as &ldquo;a very exciting new area,&rdquo; adding it is now &ldquo;the third checkpoint inhibitor to show benefit in patients with melanoma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until now, the company has not revealed the degree of benefit over treatment with Opdivo alone - already an effective option for people with this type of cancer.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Relatlimab is now the third checkpoint inhibitor to show benefit in patients with melanoma.""</span></p>
<p>In an oral presentation at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the firm will show that a median PFS of 10.12 months was achieved for the test arm, compared with 4.63 months in those who received Opdivo alone.</p>
<p>In addition, exploratory, descriptive analyses show the combination extended PFS regardless of pre-specified subgroups and stratification factors.</p>
<p>While the results appear to be slightly below those offered by a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy (ipilimumab), as shown in the Checkmate-067 study, there seems to be a significant safety advantage which could make all the difference.</p>
<p>Severe adverse events reached 19% for the LAG-3-blocking combo, around a third of the figure for the Yervoy-based combination.</p>
<p>As a fixed-dose combination, the product Bristol Myers is developing is also simple to administer, with a reduced risk of dosing error.</p>
<h2>LAG-3 inhibition</h2>
<p>Described as the &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; of checkpoint blocker, LAG-3 inhibition is a novel approach which Bristol Myers hopes will unlock the ability to bolster the immune response in a new way, while preventing resistance.</p>
<p>Dr Cheng tells The Pharma Letter: &ldquo;I think this is an important advancement for patients that have melanoma, showing that they can receive, with a dual I/O combination, better clinical benefit and results compared to just a single agent PD1 inhibitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By suppressing T-cell activation and cytokine secretion, relatlimab offers a unique mechanism of action which appears to be synergistic with traditional immunotherapies targeting PD-1.</p>
<h2>Commercial development</h2>
<p>We will have to wait longer for the more important endpoint of overall survival (OS), but the results are highly encouraging for the New York-based firm, which appears to be going from strength to strength following the $74 billion acquisition of Celgene.</p>
<p>Given the predominance of Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s (NYSE: MRK) PD-1 targeting superstar Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in so many areas of immuno-oncology, the lead Bristol Myers appears to be developing in LAG-3 inhibition could be important.</p>
<p>While Merck is also working on a LAG-3 blocker, MK-4280 or favezelimab, which it is combining with Keytruda, the company is yet to present late stage data on its performance.</p>
<p>The firm is presenting its first sets of in-human data at ASCO, showing an overall response rate (ORR) of only 6%, with a single complete remission, in a small number of people with colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>It is still early days, but the data boasted by Bristol Myers could show the direction of travel and the potential for the firm&rsquo;s leadership from this point.</p>
<p>Asked about the likely next steps in terms of registration, Dr Cheng remains coy, stating: &ldquo;We tend not to discuss regulatory options,&rdquo; while adding &ldquo;we do want to recognize that progression-free survival is an accepted endpoint from regulatory perspective, so we look forward to those discussions.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-20 10:56:00",,"Bristol, Myers, ASCO, checkpoint, combination, show, blocker, data, melanoma, relatlimab, benefit, LAG-, Opdivo, trial, meeting, LAG-blocking, results, fir","At this year’s ASCO meeting, Bristol Myers Squibb will present the first data from a Phase III trial evaluating a LAG-3-blocking antibody.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-20 10:56:24","2021-05-20 11:58:14",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/asco-2021-bristol-myers-boasts-next-gen-checkpoint-blocker,,,,,,biotech_lab_big.jpg,biotech_lab_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Immuno-oncology,"ASCO, Conferences, In Depth, Interviews",USA,"Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene","favezelimab, Opdivo, relatlimab, Yervoy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In this population, median DFS was not yet reached for Tecentriq, a checkpoint blocker that is a top seller for Roche &ndash; with first-quarter 2021 revenues of $847 million, compared with 35.3 for BSC.</p>
<p>In the larger population of all randomized Stage II-IIIA study participants, Tecentriq reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 21% (HR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.64&ndash;0.96) after a median follow-up of 32.2 months. In this population, Tecentriq increased DFS by a median of seven months (42.3 months versus 35.3 months with BSC). Safety data for Tecentriq were consistent with its known safety profile and no new safety signals were identified.</p>
<h2><strong>Results lay the groundwork for a new approach to treatment</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;These landmark Phase III data demonstrate for the first time that cancer immunotherapy can bring a clinically-meaningful improvement to certain people with early lung cancer in the adjuvant setting,&rdquo; said Dr Levi Garraway, Roche&rsquo;s chief medical officer and head of global Product Development. &ldquo;These results lay the groundwork for a new approach to the treatment of early-stage lung cancer and bring us closer to our goal of providing an effective and tailored treatment option for every person diagnosed with this disease,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The goal of adjuvant therapy is to lower the risk of recurrence and provide the best opportunity for a cure. Still, about half of all patients with Stage I-III NSCLC eventually develop disease recurrence following curative-intent treatment. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is the current standard of care for patients with completely resected early-stage NSCLC (Stage IB-IIIA) who are at a high-risk of disease recurrence or relapse. This treatment provides a modest 4&ndash;5% improvement in five-year survival compared with observation.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Follow-up will continue with planned analyses of DFS in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population, including Stage IB patients, which at the time of analysis did not cross the threshold, and overall survival (OS) data, which were immature at the time of interim analysis. In the overall randomized population of study participants, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 92.7% of people receiving Tecentriq, compared with 70.7% of those receiving BSC. Grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 21.8% of people treated with Tecentriq&nbsp;compared with 11.5% in the BSC group; 0.8% of people in the Tecentriq group experienced a Grade 5 AE. As anticipated, the addition of up to one year of Tecentriq&nbsp;following chemotherapy led to a higher number of AEs compared with BSC.</p>

<p>Results from a new integrated analysis including data from the MELTEMI Phase III trials have been presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2021 International Conference.</p>
<p>During the period of the BORA and MELTEMI extension trials, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) did not increase from rates comparable to placebo observed in the Phase III pivotal trials.</p>
<p>Rates of serious infection, hypersensitivity, immunogenicity, and malignancy were low across all treatment groups, with no deaths during the on-treatment window. The most commonly-reported AEs during the open-label period for patients receiving Fasenra every eight weeks were nasopharyngitis, asthma, headache, and bronchitis. These data confirm Fasenra&rsquo;s well-established safety profile.</p>
<p>In secondary endpoints, Fasenra sustained the reduction in asthma exacerbation rates observed during predecessor Phase III trials, with annualized asthma exacerbation rates remaining consistently low over the five-year treatment period.</p>
<p>Arnaud Bourdin, head of pulmonology, Professor of respiratory medicine at Arnaud de Villeneuve Hospital, Montpellier, France, and primary investigator for MELTEMI, said: &ldquo;Clinicians treating severe eosinophilic asthma want to ensure the therapy they prescribe will continue to help patients control their illness in the long term, with a consistent safety profile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the new MELTEMI data, physicians and their patients should feel confident that Fasenra provides a treatment option that can do exactly that &ndash; reduce exacerbations, with a known safety profile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark White, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s global franchise head, Fasenra, said: &ldquo;The new data from MELTEMI are exciting as they confirm Fasenra&rsquo;s efficacy and safety profile seen in previously reported Phase III trials. These results should offer further confidence to physicians and patients that the positive outcomes they&rsquo;re experiencing whilst using Fasenra can be maintained for the longer-term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the USA, European Union (EU), Japan and other countries, and is approved for self-administration in the USA and EU.</p>

<p>AGEN1777 is an Fc-enhanced antibody in late preclinical development designed to target major inhibitory receptors expressed on T and NK cells to improve anti-tumor activity. In preclinical studies this approach has shown significant potential in tumor models where anti-PD-1 or anti-TIGIT monospecific antibodies alone are ineffective.</p>
<h2><strong>Deal provides $200 million upfront</strong></h2>
<p>Under the agreement, BMS will become solely responsible for the development and any subsequent commercialization of AGEN1777 and its related products worldwide. Agenus will receive a $200 million upfront payment and up to $1.36 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net product sales.</p>
<p>Agenus will retain options to conduct clinical studies under the development plan, to conduct combination studies with certain other Agenus pipeline assets, and also, on commercialization, to co-promote AGEN1777 in the USA. The agreement is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.</p>
<h2><strong>Others in the field</strong></h2>
<p>Bristol Myers, which alongside pharma giants Switzerland&rsquo;s Roche (ROG: SIX) and the USA&rsquo;s Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK), is one of the leading cancer immunotherapy developers, already was exploring TIGIT as a target.</p>
<p>Roche is developing the anti-TIGIT therapy tiragolumab, for non-small cell lung cancer, while Merck is advancing its anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab into Phase III testing for NSCLC. A compound dubbed BMS-986207 is listed on a federal trials database as being in several studies, two of which are recruiting patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) has a partnership to co-develop next-generation cancer immunotherapies from Arcus Biosciences' pipeline, which includes the anti-TIGIT antibody AB154.</p>
<p>Agenus expects to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the development of AGEN1777 with the US Food and Drug Administration in the second quarter of 2021. BMS intends to advance the research and development of AGEN1777 in immuno-oncology for high priority tumor indications including non-small cell lung cancer.</p>

<p>Based on the recently-announced clinical results from APEIRON&rsquo;s Phase II trial with APN01 in COVID-19, the candidate will be developed in further international clinical trials with different COVID-19 patient populations and drug delivery routes.</p>
<p>APEIRON was invited to participate in the US ACTIV-4d RAAS trial, part of Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV), initiated and funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the United States&rsquo; National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>APEIRON&rsquo;s specific recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2), APN01, was prioritized for study by a broad panel of clinical trial experts through the Collaborative Network of Networks for Evaluating COVID-19 Therapeutic Strategies (CONNECTS). The trial is anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2021. The trial is largely funded by public grants.</p>
<p>APEIRON&rsquo;s recently completed Phase II trial showed significant improvement in certain parameters of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) with APN01 treatment compared to placebo. Data also suggested that APN01 will confer greatest therapeutic benefit to patients with lower WHO scores. The randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled ACTIV-4d RAAS trial will enroll approximately 1,600 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, at more than 50 individual sites. APN01 will be one of at least three agents to be evaluated in the trial.</p>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Opens the US and international markets&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The ACTIV-4d RAAS trial perfectly fits our strategy to address larger patient populations and various disease states based on our recent convincing results. Administering APN01 earlier in the course of COVID-19 potentially protects patients from progressing to a severe stage of the disease with uncontrollable inflammation and organ damage,&rdquo; said chief executive Peter Llewellyn-Davies, adding: &ldquo;We are confident that this Phase II US trial will confirm the clinical benefits of APN01 in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and opens the US and international markets for our promising drug candidate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In parallel to the US clinical trial with APN01 as intravenous application, APEIRON is preparing a company-sponsored Phase I trial to evaluate drug delivery of APN01 through inhalation in order to target all infected or at-risk patients earlier in the course of the disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additonally, an improved manufacturing process for a commercially viable mass scale production of good manufacturing practice (GMP) material of APN01 is under preparation.</p>

<p>In a statement, the groups said: &ldquo;Immediate action must focus on stepping up responsible dose sharing and maximizing production without compromising quality or safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call to action has been issued by leading European trade group The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and the USA&rsquo;s Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), as well as several other national and regional bodies.</p>
<p>There has been an increased level of concern over the availability of vaccines in lower-income countries, as rich countries move on to vaccinating ever younger and healthier parts of their populations.</p>
<p>Concerns have been made more acute by the evolution of new variants which analysts worry could potentially undermine the protection afforded by existing vaccines.</p>
<p>Globally, new infections have begun to fall from an early-May peak of around 900,000 per day but remain high, with an estimated 681,000 new cases on May 15.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been around 164 million cases of coronavirus, with an estimated 3.5 million deaths.</p>
<h2>Steps to broaden access</h2>
<p>The global life sciences industry has called on manufacturers, governments, and non-governmental organizations to work together to broaden access to vaccines, with a number of recommendations to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Innovative vaccine manufacturers and biotech companies are being asked to increase dose sharing through COVAX or other efficient mechanisms, and to &ldquo;expend every effort&rdquo; to make additional uncommitted COVID-19 vaccine doses available.</p>
<p>They are also being called upon to undertake all practicable efforts to maximize COVID-19 vaccine output, and to eliminate trade barriers, supporting the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations' (CEPI's) efforts to create an independent platform for matchmaking and fill and finish capacity.</p>
<p>In addition, the trade bodies have called on manufacturers to support country readiness by partnering with governments, and drive further innovation by prioritizing the development of new COVID-19 vaccines.</p>","2021-05-19 12:23:00",,"access, vaccines, life, industry, sciences, global, trade, bodies, action, vaccine, steps, coronavirus, improve, manufacturers, calls, coordinated, urge","Trade bodies representing the global life sciences industry have come together to urge coordinated steps to improve access to coronavirus vaccines.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-19 12:23:05","2021-05-19 12:43:35",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/global-life-sciences-industry-calls-for-action-on-vaccine-access,,,,,,novavax_vaccine_large.jpg,novavax_vaccine_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Production, Public health",Global,"ABPI, EFPIA, PhRMA","Comirnaty, mRNA-1273, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Eisai obtained the manufacturing and marketing approval of Remitoro, marketed elsewhere as Ontak, on March 23, 2021. Rights were acquired from Ligand Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: LGND) in 2006. Remitoro was included in Japan&rsquo;s National Health Insurance Drug Price List on May 19, 2021.</p>
<p>The agent is a fusion protein consisting of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and partial sequence of diphtheria toxin, and specifically binds to the IL-2 receptor on the surface of tumoral lymphocytes. The antitumor efficacy of denileukin diftitox is believed to depend on the intracellular delivery of diphtheria toxin fragment which inhibits protein synthesis and induce cell death.</p>
<p>The approval of Remitoro in Japan is based primarily on data from Study 205, which is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical study, conducted in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the agent in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL.</p>
<p>Eisai will conduct a post-marketing special use results survey (all-case surveillance) in all patients who are administered the agent until a pre-determined number of patients has been reached in accordance with an approval condition imposed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW).</p>
<p>According to a survey by the MHLW, it is estimated that, in Japan, the number of patients with PTCL is less than 6,000 and the number of patients with CTCL is less than 4,000. These diseases may have a poor prognosis or be difficult to treat.

<p>In results from the first clinical study using commercially representative material, SRP-9001 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin) demonstrated robust expression of micro-dystrophin and no new safety signals from prior studies, supporting its potentially differentiated profile for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.</p>
<p>Swiss pharma giant Roche entered the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-forking-out-1-3-billion-on-aav-capsids-deal"">partnership in December 2019</a>, when it paid Sarepta an upfront $750 million in cash and $400 million in equity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted by these seminal results from the ENDEAVOR Study, our first trial results with SRP-9001 made by our commercial-scale manufacturing process. These data show strong transduction of the micro-dystrophin gene, resulting in robust expression of the properly localized micro-dystrophin protein, and did so with no new or unexpected safety signals,&rdquo; said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive of Sarepta. &ldquo;In addition to characterizing and differentiating SRP-9001, these results confirm the extraordinary work done over the last two and a half years to build an at-scale gene therapy manufacturing process and corresponding analytics sufficient to meet the needs of the Duchenne population with what we believe will be a potentially life-changing therapy. Armed with these data, we will seek a meeting with the FDA with the goal of rapidly starting our registrational study,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>
<p>In the open-label study, 20 participants between the ages of four and seven were treated with a single infusion of SRP-9001 at a dose of 1.33x10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg. In muscle biopsies from the first 11 patients taken 12 weeks after treatment, the following results were observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>All patients demonstrated robust transduction, with mean micro-dystrophin expression of 55.4% of normal, as measured by western blot.</li>
<li>Muscle dystrophin levels demonstrated a mean of 70.5% (baseline 12.8%) muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin at 12 weeks with a mean intensity at the sarcolemma of 116.9% (baseline 41.0%) compared to normal biopsies, as measured by immunofluorescence. Comparisons between baseline and post-treatment measures were statistically significant (p=0.001 for positive fibers, and p=0.002 for intensity).</li>
<li>Mean vector genome copies per nucleus reached 3.87.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety profile of SRP-9001 observed in the first 11 participants in ENDEAVOR is consistent with the safety seen in earlier studies using clinical manufacturing process material. In line with previously reported clinical data, no clinically relevant complement activation was observed in these 11 patients. Two patients experienced serious adverse events (transaminase elevation in one patient and nausea and vomiting in a second patient) that fully resolved.</p>","2021-05-19 11:11:00","Early-stage trial shows positive profile for Sarepta’s DMD candidate S","Sarepta Therapeutics, SRP-9001, DMD, Muscular dystrophy, Duchenne, Roche,","Early-stage trial shows positive profile for Sarepta’s DMD candidate SRP-9001",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-19 11:10:31","2021-05-19 11:18:47",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/early-stage-trial-shows-positive-profile-for-sarepta-s-dmd-candidate-srp-9001,,,,,,sarepta-big.jpg,sarepta-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Muscular dystrophy",Biotechnology,"Cell and Gene Therapy, Musculoskeletal, Rare diseases","Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research","Switzerland, USA","Roche, Sarepta Therapeutics",SRP-9001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

With the Indian government seeking FDI specifically from companies intending to diversify manufacturing operations away from China, the $30 billion swell incorporates a tidy amount in the pharmaceutical sector, reports The Pharma Letter’s India correspondent.","<p>Even as Asia attracted a significant amount of cross-border investment, accounting for more than half of global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), FDI equity inflows into India increased by 13%, with the country receiving more than $30 billion in the first half of the financial year ending March 2021. With the Indian government seeking FDI specifically from companies intending to diversify manufacturing operations away from China, the $30 billion swell incorporates a tidy amount in the pharmaceutical sector, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s India correspondent.</p>
<p>India's pharmaceutical sector has gained renewed global attention due to the crisis brought about by COVID-19, with the FDI inflows firmly establishing India's credentials as a safe and key investment destination in the world. Experts expect FDI flow to easily cross the $50 billion mark in 2021 given the government's focus, especially after COVID-19, to make India a manufacturing hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-China sentiment has also provided a bigger opportunity to attract fund flow. To encourage companies exiting China, the government intends to offer a red-carpet treatment, and is already working on simplifying entry process and ensuring ease of doing business in India.</p>
<p>Currently, 100% FDI is permitted in the pharma sector. FDI up to 100% in greenfield pharma projects is permitted under the automatic route, and FDI up to 74% in brownfield pharma projects is permitted under the automatic route.</p>
<p>Mergers and acquisition in Indian brownfield pharma continue to be an attractive proposition for foreign investors looking to enter India. With many global players deciding to move operations out of China, and India emerging a strong alternative contender, investment in the pharma sector is likely to gain further momentum, say experts.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s concerted push through initiatives such as Make in India, National Digital Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat Scheme, etc, has cemented the overdrive.</p>
<h2><strong>India attracts FDI</strong></h2>
<p>The total market size of the Indian drug industry is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030, said Chemical and Fertilizer Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, noting that the Indian pharmaceutical industry has proven to be a dependable supplier of quality drugs at a time of global need on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>India has been serving more than 200 countries with its pharma products and will continue to discharge its responsibilities, he added. Stating that pharmaceuticals are one of the top-10 attractive sectors for foreign investment in India, Mr Gowda said FDI inflows in the pharmaceutical sector reached $499.73 million in 2019-20, recording a growth of 98% year-on-year.</p>
<p>India's FDI system is the most liberal in the world, and the nation continued to draw direct investments even during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Niti Aayog chief executive Amitabh Kant, who went on to add that the automated route accounted for nearly 90% of the inflows.</p>
<p>Despite invocation of offshore guarantees given by Indian companies, pressure from overseas lenders, and takeover attempts by deep pocketed foreigners amid plummeting stock and asset prices, India continues to attract FDI, he said.</p>
<p>India's FDI saw a significant jump in November 2020. FDI data released by the Commerce Ministry shows that total FDI in the month of November 2020 grew by a whopping 81% to $10.15 billion against $5.6 billion in November 2019. FDI equity also jumped to $8.5 billion as against $2.8 billion in November 2019, registering a growth of 70%.</p>
<p>India attracted total FDI inflow of $58.37 billion during April to November 2020, the highest ever for the first eight months of a financial year and 22% higher as compared to the first eight months of 2019-20 (at $47.67 billion).</p>
<h2><strong>China upset with move</strong></h2>
<p>In April 2020, India modified its FDI policy intending to prevent an 'opportunistic takeover' of companies affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The initiative upset China which has defined it as disobeying the international trade principal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules are primarily aimed at non-resident entities that are from countries that share a land border with India. This includes China and other nations such as Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Investor concerns over the global pandemic had caused stock and asset prices to plummet last year, sparking fears that some Indian companies could be vulnerable to pressures from overseas lenders and takeover attempts by deep-pocketed foreigners.</p>
<p>To curtail any such attempt, the government made its prior approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share a land border with India.</p>
<p>Upholding the move, in a recent written reply to India's Parliament, Minister Som Parkash said the changes made in the FDI norms last year are fully compliant with India's commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>
<p>Mr Parkash said in the meetings of the Council for Trade in Services under WTO held in October and November last year, China had raised concern on the changes made in India's FDI policy.</p>
<p>In early January 2021 too, China had raised concerns with the WTO over the harmful impact of India's FDI restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>India has asserted that FDI from all members of the WTO, including China, continues to be permitted. The change in rule was necessary in the light of investments by foreign companies amid weak markets and company valuations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sources point out that the Indian government is further looking at easing restrictions for Chinese FDI by allowing companies from the bordering country to invest up to 25% in an Indian company through the automatic route. However, sources state this is being discussed only for non-sensitive sectors such as manufacturing, automobile, services, and technology.</p>
<p>""The government is deliberating on reverting FDI of certain percentage to the automatic route coming from land bordering nations including China. However, that could only be for sectors where 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route and pose no risk to national security,"" sources said.</p>
<p>Meantime, India&rsquo;s pharmaceutical sector has been a major recipient of Chinese FDI. The Shanghai-based drug firm Fosun Pharma acquired a 74% majority stake in Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&amp;D firm Gland Pharma in 2017, at a valuation of $1.08 billion. The recent March quarter numbers of Gland Pharma shows 34% growth in consolidated net profit on robust sales.</p>

<p>The drug lost its registration in Russia in April this year. It was approved in the USA and the European Union in 2014, while in Russia suvorexant was cleared in 2016. According to Russian pharma analytics agency DSM Group, during the validity of the registration certificate in Russia, not a single pack of the drug was sold in the Russian market. For four years, the drug has not been included in the list of vital and essential in Russia, which prevented selling at its maximum selling price.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Cost deterrent to uptake</strong></h2>
<p>According to the Russian Kommersant business paper, which cites some leading Russian psychiatrists, the main reason for the poor uptake of MSD&rsquo;s Belsomra in Russia was the high cost of the drug. Setting such a high price for the drug could be primarily explained by the lack of side effects, which are typical for other drugs widely used in Russia for the treatment of insomnia. Among such drugs are usually the so-called Z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon) that have replaced benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Sergei Shulyak, DSM Group&rsquo;s chief executive said in an interview with Kommersant, another reason for suspension of sales of Belsomra in Russia was the current Russian legislation regulating the release and storage of such drugs in the local market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to him, currently not all pharmacies are ready to bear the costs of organizing the turnover of psychotropic drugs, given the limited volume of their sales. In 2020, the commercial turnover of prescription sleeping pills in Russia amounted to about 1% of the total value of drugs sold in this group, or 107.6 million roubles (~$1.5 million).</p>
<p>Due to strict sales rules, even Z-drugs of the old generation and benzodiazepines are currently sold in Russia in limited volumes. As a result, the problem of insomnia for Russian patients is usually solved with the help of antihistamines.</p>","2021-05-18 12:26:00","Merck revokes registration for its next-generation sleeping pill Belso","Merck & Co, MSD, Belsomra, Registration, Revoked, Insomnia, Selling price","Merck revokes registration for its next-generation sleeping pill Belsomra in Russia",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-18 12:25:24","2021-05-18 12:33:38",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-revokes-registration-for-its-next-generation-sleeping-pill-belsomra-in-russia,,,,,,msd_merck_sign_large.jpg,msd_merck_sign_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Psychoactive drugs",Pharmaceutical,"CNS Diseases, Neurological","Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Russian market","Russia, USA","Merck & Co, MSD",Belsomra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The vaccine, initially named COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, but now known as Vaxzevria, will be intended for exports only and will not be supplied to the Russian market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Mr Ignatiev noted, the output of the new production will amount to several hundred thousand doses a month. So far, an interest in the vaccine has been expressed by countries of the Persian Gulf, which are expected to become its major buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deliveries of the vaccine will be conducted by R-Pharm together with the Russian Fund of Direct Investments (RFDI), Russia's sovereign wealth fund established to make investments in leading companies of high-growth sectors of the Russian economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 2020, head of the RFDI, Kirill Dmitriev, announced that R-Pharm would produce a vaccine from AstraZeneca and Oxford University. According to him, that will take place on the basis of commercial agreement, that was signed between the two companies.</p>
<p>Alexei Repik, R-Pharm&rsquo;s founder and chairman explained that under the terms of the agreement R-Pharm will provide technological facilities for the new production.

<p>The Federal Circuit previously ruled against Sandoz in a divided decision upholding Amgen&rsquo;s patents on the rheumatoid arthritis therapy, the biosimilar and generic medicines unit of Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX) announced today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are disappointed the Supreme Court decided not to review our case,&rdquo; said Keren Haruvi, president of Sandoz US and Head of North America. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s decision means Erelzi, a more affordable biosimilar, will not be available to US patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases until 2029; nonetheless we remain committed to providing important treatment options for patients affected by these diseases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estimates suggest that a biosimilar etanercept could have saved the US healthcare system around $1 billion per year, said Sandoz, which was the first company to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a biosimilar etanercept and the first to launch a biosimilar medicine in the USA. Erelzi has been approved in the US for more than four years, since August 2016, however Sandoz has been unable to launch this medicine in the USA due to the patent litigation.</p>
<h2><strong>Sandoz to strengthen its antibiotics manufacturing setup in Europe</strong></h2>
<p>Sandoz today also announced it will further strengthen its European antibiotics manufacturing network by further expanding production capabilities in Kundl, Austria and in Palafolls, Spain. By modernizing and simplifying its manufacturing setup, Sandoz will improve its ability to consistently deliver high-quality medicines to patients, while remaining cost-competitive on the global market.</p>
<p>In line with plans announced with the Austrian government in July 2020, Sandoz confirms that in a first step it will proceed to invest more than 100 million euros ($121 million) to introduce new manufacturing technology for the production of oral amoxicillin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for its leading penicillin product. This investment will allow Sandoz to leverage its position in Kundl as the hub and center of the only major end-to-end antibiotics supply chain in Europe, covering all production steps from API to Finished Dosage Forms (FDF) for many leading antibiotics.</p>
<p>In addition to the investment in Kundl, Sandoz announces plans for an expansion of its Palafolls site in Spain, planning to invest around 50 million euros in new production technology and increased capacity for the production of sterile penicillin APIs and sterile API mixtures.</p>
<p>As part of this network modernization plan, Sandoz will phase out the current production of oral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) at the Les Franqueses site in Spain, which it plans to close in 2024. Sterile API production is planned to transfer from Kundl to the new facility at Palafolls in 2025.</p>","2021-05-18 10:46:00","US Supreme Court denies Sandoz petition to review biosimilar Erelzi ca","Sandoz, Erelzi, Biosimilar, Enbrel Amgen, Patents, Supreme Court, Manufacturing, Antibiotics, Europe, Austria, Spain","US Supreme Court denies Sandoz petition to review biosimilar Erelzi case",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-18 10:45:31","2021-05-18 10:55:22",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-supreme-court-denies-sandoz-petition-to-review-biosimilar-erelzi-case,,,,,,sandoz-logo-big.jpg,sandoz-logo-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biosimilars, Generics","Anti-Arthritics/Rheumatics, Antibiotics","Focus On, Legal, Patents & Trademarks, Production","Europe, Switzerland, USA","Amgen, Novartis, Sandoz","Enbrel, Erelzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Developed by USA-based Apellis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: APLS), whose shares shot up nearly 20% to $53.06 yesterday, Empaveli is the first PNH treatment that binds to compliment protein C3.</p>
<p>Empaveli is approved for use in adults with PNH who are treatment na&iuml;ve as well as patients switching from the Alexion Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ALXN) C5 inhibitors Soliris (eculizumab) and Ultomiris (ravulizumab), the company noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the first, FDA-approved targeted C3 therapy, Empaveli has the potential to redefine treatment for adults with PNH, including patients switching from any C5 inhibitor and treatment-na&iuml;ve patients. Thank you to the clinical trial participants, PNH community, investigators, healthcare professionals, SFJ Pharmaceuticals, and more who helped contribute to this significant milestone,&rdquo; said Dr Cedric Francois, co-founder and chief executive of Apellis. &ldquo;This approval represents a major scientific advancement as Empaveli ushers in the first new class of complement medicine in almost 15 years. We look forward to exploring the full potential of targeting C3 and continue to advance registrational programs of this therapy across multiple complement-driven diseases with high unmet need,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Drug out-licensed to Sobi</strong></h2>
<p>Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (STO: SOBI; also known as Sobi) acquired global co-development and exclusive ex-US commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan last year, in a deal that provided an upfront $250 million for Apellis.</p>
<p>PNH is characterized by red blood cell destruction, anemia (red blood cells unable to carry enough oxygen to tissues), blood clots, and impaired bone marrow function (not making enough blood cells). The disease affects 1-1.5 people per million. Individuals are typically diagnosed around ages 35 to 40. PNH can be serious, with median survival of 10 years after diagnosis. However, some patients live for decades with only minor symptoms.</p>
<p>PNH is caused by gene mutations that affect red blood cells. Red blood cells in people with these mutations are defective and can be destroyed by the immune system, which causes anemia.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Empaveli was evaluated in a study enrolling 80 patients with PNH and anemia who had been taking eculizumab, a treatment previously approved for PNH. Patients first completed a four-week period during which they received Empaveli 1,080mg twice weekly in addition to eculizumab at their previous dose. After the first four weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive either Empaveli or their current dose of eculizumab for 16 weeks.</p>
<p>A Marketing Authorization Application for pegcetacoplan&nbsp;for the treatment of PNH is under review by the European Medicines Agency with the potential for a European Commission decision in the second half of 2021.</p>","2021-05-18 10:14:00","FDA approves Empaveli for life-threatening rare blood disease","Apellis Pharmaceuticals,","FDA approves Empaveli for life-threatening rare blood disease",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-18 09:01:43","2021-05-18 10:14:55",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-empaveli-for-life-threatening-rare-blood-disease,,,,,,apellis_big.png,apellis_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Hematology, Rare diseases","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals","Empaveli, pegcetacoplan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In particular, Greek Minister for Development and Investment, Adonis Georgiadis, said that the pursuit of the Greek government is the consolidation of a stable investment environment for the pharmaceutical companies to be able to invest.</p>
<p>He went on to state that, regarding investment clawback, the government wants to proceed to a more stable, three-year agreement with the pharmaceutical industry and the Recovery Fund, in order for a stable professional environment for pharmaceutical companies to be established in Greece, stressing that the investment clawback does not constitute a tax exemption and should therefore not raise an issue of state subsidies.</p>
<p>It constitutes an incentive reducing the additional burden imposed by the state, because clawback is an additional burden on pharmaceutical companies in the form of expenditure refund to EOPYY, the National Organization for Healthcare. It actually lifts a part of this additional burden imposed by the State, in exchange for the creation of new jobs, research and development in Greece, showcasing the Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) investment in Thessaloniki as a first successful example of this investment instrument.</p>
<p>SFEE president Olympios Papadimitriou noted that the adoption of the investment clawback is an important incentive for investments to be attracted in Greece. He reported extensively the lessons taught, originally during the financial crisis and then through the COVID-19 crisis, both at European and national level, where, amongst others, the necessity for an effective use of public resources, the enhancement of primary health care and the creation of digital/remote systems was proven.</p>
<h2><strong>Pharma&rsquo;s added value to Greek economy</strong></h2>
<p>He referred to the added value created in Greek economy by the pharmaceutical industry, contributing a 6.7 billion ($8.13 billion) for 2019, ie, accounting for 3.6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In terms of employment, the pharmaceutical industry secures 135,000 jobs &ndash; ie, 3.9% of total labor &ndash; most of them being of high specialization, while contributing annually to the national economy about 2 billion euros in taxes and social contributions. Hence, the pharmaceutical industry constitutes one of the main pillars for the development of the country.</p>
<p>In concluding, he referred to the challenges the industry and the state will be facing the day after COVID-19, as well as and the need to create &ldquo;a culture of national innovation&rdquo; and have it prevail in the country. &ldquo;We must develop a culture of national innovation in our country, enhance incentives for the attraction of investments and improve the system funding in tandem, for the latter to become more sustainable and foreseeable. This is the main quest of the companies of the sector, for them to be able to enhance their presence in the country and contribution in the national economy,&rdquo; noted Mr Papadimitriou.</p>","2021-05-17 17:11:00","Greek trade group SFEE reports on 6th Delphi Economic Forum","Greece, SFEE, Delphi Economic Forum, Investment, Innovation, Healthcare, Economy, Clawbacks","Greek trade group SFEE reports on 6th Delphi Economic Forum",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-16 13:50:43","2021-05-17 17:11:50",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/greek-trade-group-sfee-reports-on-6th-delphi-economic-forum,,,,,,greece_greek_big.jpg,greece_greek_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Focus On, Government Affairs, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Public health",Greece,SFEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Bristol Myers secured mavacamten, which was previously licensed to Sanofi (Euronext: SAN), through its $13.1 billion purchase of Brisbane, USA-based drug developer MyoKardia in late 2020.</p>
<p>The firm said at that time that the acquisition would help to accelerate the expansion of its cardiovascular portfolio, with potential further development in indications including non-obstructive HCM.</p>

<h2>'Drive towards a solution that will help to save lives'</h2>
<p>US Trade Representative Katherine Tai repeatedly defended her office's stance last week, faced with fierce questioning from lawmakers from both houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This administration has committed itself to roll up our sleeves and engage at the WTO, to exercise leadership there, to hear the concerns on both sides of this issue and drive towards a solution that will help to save lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because without a solution here, we are going to be in an economic recovery limbo for a very long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Representative Tai also stressed that &ldquo;we're not talking about giving away IP&rdquo; and added that ideas like providing compensation for companies affected by the proposed temporary waiver of IP enforcement &ldquo;are parameters for discussion, absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her reassurances are unlikely to have allayed the concerns of those companies, and of the wider industry and its supporters, who have been quick to express horror at how dangerous weakening IP rules could be.</p>
<h2>'Empty promise'</h2>
<p>According to US trade body, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the policy will in fact undermine the global response to the pandemic and compromise safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This decision will sow confusion between public and private partners, further weaken already strained supply chains and foster the proliferation of counterfeit vaccines,&rdquo; said Stephen Ubl, president and chief executive of PhRMA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This change in longstanding American policy will not save lives. It also flies in the face of President Biden&rsquo;s stated policy of building up American infrastructure and creating jobs by handing over American innovations to countries looking to undermine our leadership in biomedical discovery. This decision does nothing to address the real challenges to getting more shots in arms, including last-mile distribution and limited availability of raw materials. These are the real challenges we face that this empty promise ignores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past few days alone, we&rsquo;ve seen more American vaccine exports, increased production targets from manufacturers, new commitments to COVAX and unprecedented aid for India during its devastating COVID-19 surge. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are fully committed to providing global access to COVID-19 vaccines, and they are collaborating at a scale that was previously unimaginable, including more than 200 manufacturing and other partnerships to date. The biopharmaceutical industry shares the goal to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, and we hope we can all re-focus on that shared objective.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>'Making vaccines is hard'</h2>
<p>Law firms have also had their say.</p>
<p>Tim Harris, partner at Osborne Clarke, said: &ldquo;I am not aware of anything showing that patent or other IP rights are causing a shortage of vaccine supply. On the contrary, even in rich countries that are willing and able to pay, we have seen shortages. This arises principally from bottlenecks in raw materials, manufacturing capacity, quality control and distribution, each of which are being addressed and improved. However, this takes time and none of these would be solved by the IP waivers proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, making new vaccines is hard: we've seen how even AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) has struggled to scale up its production &ndash; it needs considerable knowhow to ensure the manufacture of high-quality vaccines. Substandard vaccines may undermine the existing vaccination drive and give a false sense of security.<br /> <br />Mr Harris added: &ldquo;Neither has it been explained how knowhow, once transferred, can be &lsquo;revoked&rsquo; &ndash; because in practice this is not possible. This would be a major concern for all companies. For example, BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX) has been a pioneer of mRNA treatments which can be used for a wide range of diseases, and before COVID-19 was largely focused on various cancer treatments. If this knowhow is forcibly acquired by third parties, it fundamentally undermines property rights and reduces the likelihood that investment will be made in other technologies that could help in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Remaining blockers 'need to get out of the way'</h2>
<p>Not everyone is so opposed to the US government&rsquo;s position, however. Among the groups that campaigned for governments to back the waiver is the People&rsquo;s Vaccine Alliance.</p>
<p>This is a movement of health, humanitarian and human rights organizations, past and present world leaders, health experts, faith leaders and economists advocating that COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured rapidly and at scale, as global common goods, free of IP protections and made available to all people, in all countries, free of charge.</p>
<p>Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now, part of the People&rsquo;s Vaccine Alliance. He has called for other western nations to take the same stance as the USA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the many months since this waiver was first proposed, we could have produced many hundreds of millions more vaccines. Let&rsquo;s get moving. The UK, European Union, and all remaining blockers need to get out of the way and let the whole world work to contain this awful virus as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>More symbolic than meaningful?</h2>
<p>So should pharma companies, their shareholders and the wider industry be concerned?</p>
<p>In principle, it is easy to see why the pharmaceutical industry is alarmed by the idea that IP can be cast aside in this way by the government of the world&rsquo;s leading superpower.</p>
<p>In reality, it may turn out to be more of a symbolic gesture from a rich nation's new government to show its ethical approach in helping less wealthy populations to potentially access vaccines once its own people have been vaccinated, rather than a move that impacts heavily on drugmakers and the framework in which they operate.</p>","2021-05-17 10:02:00",,"vaccines, waiver, rights, pharmaceutical, COVID-, lives, global, government, American, months, countries, companies, TRIPS, people, trade, industry, save","The mere notion of the US government supporting any policies that might encourage pharmaceutical patents to be ignored would have seemed inconceivable only 18 m",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-17 08:44:16","2021-05-19 10:50:27",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/trips-waiver-is-the-us-backing-a-cause-for-concern-for-pharma,,,,,,wto_ip_trade_big.jpg,wto_ip_trade_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Feature, Focus On, Government Affairs, In Depth, Legal, Patents & Trademarks",USA,"AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GLOBAL JUSTICE NOW, Moderna, Pfizer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

On the negative side, Biogen released Phase II/III results for its cotoretigene toliparvovec (BIIB112) in a retinal disease that failed to meet its primary endpoint.</p>
<h2><strong>ChemoCentryx&rsquo; future in doubt as avacopan foundation crumbles</strong></h2>
<p>After Friday&rsquo;s split adcom <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/knife-edge-panel-vote-puts-vasculitis-treatment-in-doubt"">vote on ChemoCentryx&rsquo; avacopan</a> in ANCA-associated vasculitis, even the sell-side seems to have given up on the project&rsquo;s prospects of approval, commented Madeleine Armstrong writing on Evaluate Vantage. And a glance at the group&rsquo;s pipeline shows little else to get excited about.</p>
<p>Avacopan&rsquo;s chances in hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy look like a long shot after mid-stage failures last year; ChemoCentryx also has plans in lupus, historically a graveyard for biopharma. And any future successes might be tempered by concerns raised by the FDA about avacopan&rsquo;s liver toxicity. So what next for ChemoCentryx? The company did not mention its Phase 1 asset CCX507 in its latest earnings release, focusing instead on the pre-clinical oral checkpoint inhibitor CCX559; however, others like <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/analysis/vantage-point-going-small-hit-it-big"">Curis have been working on oral projects for some time now</a>&nbsp;with little progress.</p>
<p>Adding commentary, an analyst at Avisol Capital Partners said that the critical FDA briefing doc, tells him that a CRL (complete response letter) is likely because the FDA has no reason to go against its own briefing document and break the tie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got lucky with ChemoCentryx in that I didn&rsquo;t like the high valuation and decided not to invest. Had I invested in CCXI when I wrote my previous article, I would be sitting on an 80% loss as of now after its sordid performance at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got lucky because of another rule I follow. If a company&rsquo;s insider trading data However, we must understand that the study does not reflect what the FDA briefing document originally said - which is the original FDA internal opinion. There is no statistic to show whether in those instances when the FDA and the adcom differed, whether the adcom differed with the briefing docs as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That means, if the adcom agrees with the briefing doc that there is a problem with the drug, the FDA is not going to disagree with the adcom about its own briefing doc. In general, the FDA, naturally, is more restrictive than the adcom as studies have shown. This analysis him that the CCXI situation is hopeless, and the drug will receive a CRL.</p>
<h2><strong>COVID-19 vaccine leaders make hay while Novavax flounders</strong></h2>
<p>According to Jacob Plieth writing on Evaluate Vantage, Novavax&rsquo; fairy-tale journey from biotech basket case to serious <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/third-quarter-submission-now-looks-likely-for-novavax-vaccine"">COVID-19 vaccine contender has hit problems</a>. Investors are still awaiting US Phase III data that some had expected in March, and to this issue Novavax has now added a manufacturing delay.</p>
<p>The stock slid 9% on May 11and another 20% the following morning as the group said production capacity for the recombinant nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 would miss its earlier target by up to six months. It would be ironic if a vaccine seen as having huge scientific promise ended up missing its window of opportunity.</p>
<p>This is precisely the scenario with which Novavax is now coming to terms, at least in the west, where vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson have made huge progress in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing deaths and incidence, and allowing lockdowns to start being eased.</p>
<p>Novavax now says US, Europe and UK filings will be delayed to the third quarter, arguing that despite the setbacks it can see &ldquo;light at the end of the tunnel.&rdquo; But it gets worse. Not only will clinical data delays set back filing and approval, whenever NVX-CoV2373 is eventually launched its rollout will be slower than had been expected owing to a shortage of raw materials.</p>
<p>In January, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-novavax-idUSKBN29Y2WP"">Novavax had told Reuters</a> that it would be producing up to 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses monthly by May or June. Last Monday it revealed that the end of the third quarter would see capacity of only 100 million doses a month reached, with 150 million a month not hit until the fourth quarter. At least Novavax has already pre-sold around 109 million NVX-CoV2373 doses to US Operation Warp Speed, and the $1.7 billion or this is money in the bank, said Mr Plieth.</p>
<p>Blogger Shock Exchange on Seeking Alpha noted that Novavax has never brought a vaccine to market and doubts may grow among the investment community. CVAC expects regulatory approval for its vaccine within weeks. This could create another serious competitor, in addition to Moderna and Pfizer. Uncertainty over emergency use authorization (EUA_ and future revenue remain.</p>
<p>Novavax has been able to garner noticeable vaccine supply contracts. In February the company signed a deal with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to provide 1.1 billion doses of its vaccine to the COVAX facility. It has also signed supply deals with Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These arrangements appear to be great public relations. Novavax may not be able to fulfill these agreements until it receives EUA for its vaccine.</p>
<p>Novavax has completed the enrollment of the pivotal Phase III trials in the USA and Mexico, and the final analysis is expected to be reported in second-quarter 2021, the company said.</p>
<h2><strong>Curis renaissance continues</strong></h2>
<p>In December six patient&rsquo; worth of data boosted Curis&rsquo; stock more than fivefold, noted Madeleine Armstrong on Evaluate Vantage. Last Wednesday, results in another three patients added 66% to the company&rsquo;s market cap and raised hopes that the group could have a viable project in the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/curis-rockets-on-release-of-data-for-ca-4948-in-aml-and-mds"">oral Irak-4 inhibitor CA-4948</a>.</p>
<p>But it is early days for the asset and Curis still has a lot to do. The data, detailed in an EHA abstract, come from a Phase I/II study in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: in nine evaluable subjects, there were two complete responses and two bone marrow complete responses.</p>
<p>Curis executives said during a conference call yesterday that they had been on the lookout for rhabdomyolysis after seeing it previously in a study in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at a 400mg twice-daily dose. They do not appear to believe that this is a problem with the lower doses in AML/MDS.</p>
<p>The company now has to figure out which dose to take into Phase II, with the executives saying that all three &ldquo;look therapeutic.&rdquo; When asked, they would not give details on which dose or doses&nbsp;led to the CRs, saying this information would be presented at EHA.</p>
<p>Curis, whose market cap now sits at nearly $1.5bn, has a lot riding on CA-4948. Its next most advanced asset is the anti-Vista monoclonal antibody CI-8993, on which phase 1 data is due in the second half of the year. Two further clinical-stage assets are on ice after earlier disappointments. Still, the group is way ahead in the Irak-4 space in oncology. Plenty of others are looking at the mechanism, but in autoimmune diseases, said Ms Armstrong.</p>
<h2><strong>BIIB112 missed in XLPR</strong></h2>
<p>Biogen reported a negative readout from <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/disappointing-results-from-biogen-s-gene-therapy-study-for-xlrp"">Phase II/III XIRIUS study</a> of cotoretigene toliparvovec (BIIB112), a gene therapy for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), commented SVB Leering Research analyst Marc Goodman.</p>
<p>This is clearly disappointing news, but this product has not been a focus for investors, so we wouldn&rsquo;t expect much of a meaningful move in the stock. Also, it was never clear to Leerink how significant this program would have been commercially given that a few other companies have also been pursuing this orphan opportunity. Mr Goodman also does not include any sales for this product in his model or any value for this program in our SOTP valuation, so he is making no changes to his earnings forecasts or price target based on this news. Additionally, since the company is not providing much details on the data yet, it&rsquo;s difficult to know if this negative trial has any read-through to the acquired Nightstar Therapeutics (acquired about two years ago) technology more broadly. We maintain our Outperform rating.</p>
<p>Biogen continues to evaluate the XIRIUS data before communicating potential next steps, and it plans to present detailed data at a future scientific meeting. It also highlighted the company&rsquo;s other ophthalmology programs, including BIIB111 in choroideremia, as well as its collaboration with ViGeneron GmbH, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, and Catalyst Biosciences.</p>
<p>Adding their voices, Amy Brown and Joanne Fagg writing on Evaluate Vantage pointed out that Biogen paid almost $1 billion two years ago for Nightstar, for two clinical-stage gene therapies for rare eye diseases that cause blindness. One of the two, BIIB112 for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, looks to be going nowhere. The XIRIUS study failed its primary endpoint, which measured vision improvements via a technique called MAIA microperimetry, Biogen said today. Positive trends were observed across several clinically relevant prespecified secondary endpoints, it added, saying the future of the programme had yet to decided. With nothing available to treat this genetic condition, which typically causes blindness at 40, and no safety concerns with BIIB112, there are perhaps motivations for a resurrection. However, investors with long memories will recall previous concerns about lack of efficacy with the project.</p>
<p>Also commenting, Ned Pagliarulo on BioPharma Dive said Biogen's acquisition of Nightstar signaled the biotech company's commitment to gene therapy research, an investment it's expanded upon with subsequent deals like a <a href=""https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-vigeneron-gene-therapy-eye-diseases/592919/"">January collaboration with Germany's ViGeneron</a> and another <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-forking-out-1-3-billion-on-aav-capsids-deal"">earlier this week with Capsigen</a>.</p>
<p>Testing on another Nightstar therapy, for a rare eye disease called choroideremia, is still ongoing, and Biogen is now working with ViGeneron and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Institute on other gene therapies for the eye.</p>
<p>The disappointing outcome reported Friday, however, could diminish confidence the choroideremia therapy will succeed. ""We think these results could serve as a canary in the coal mine given the overlap in technology,"" wrote Brian Skorney, an analyst at R W Baird, in an investor note. Results are expected later this year.</p>
<p>And while Biogen's XLRP work is now set back, other companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AGTC and 4D Molecular Therapeutics are testing gene therapies for the disease, he pointed out.</p>","2021-05-16 10:50:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 14, 2021","News review, ChemoCentryx, Avacopan, Novavax, NVX-oV2373, Curis, CA-4948, Biogen, Cotoretigene toliparvovec","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 14, 2021",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-16 10:44:25","2021-05-16 10:59:26",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-14-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Hematology, Infectious diseases, Oncology, Ophthalmics, Rare diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Focus On, Regulation, Research",,"Biogen, ChemoCentryx, Curis, Novavax","avacopan, CA-4948, cotoretigene toliparvovec, NVX-CoV2373",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The XIRIUS study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically-significant improvement in the proportion of treated study eyes with &ge;7 dB improvement from baseline at &ge;5 of the 16 central loci of the 10-2 grid assessed by Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA) microperimetry. This assessment was performed at 12 months and compared to the study eye of patients randomized to the untreated control group. Positive trends were observed across several clinically relevant prespecified secondary endpoints.</p>
<h2><strong>Drug came with Nightstar acquisition</strong></h2>
<p>Cotoretigene toliparvovec is one of two clinical-stage gene therapies that came to Biogen via its $877 million <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-to-acquire-rare-inherited-retinal-disease-drug-developer"">acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics</a> in 2019. The other gene therapy in that deal, timrepigene emparvovec, is currently in Phase III testing as a potential treatment for choroideremia, another rare inherited retinal disease.</p>
<p>XLRP is a rare, inherited retinal disease that is associated with progressive vision loss as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Initial symptoms are difficulty seeing at night, followed by restriction of the field of vision and eventually blindness in most people by the age of 40. Patients living with XLRP currently have no approved treatments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the Phase II/III XIRIUS study of cotoretigene toliparvovec did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by positive trends in other pre-specified clinically relevant endpoints, such as a measure of visual acuity under low light conditions,&rdquo; said Dr Katherine Dawson, head of the therapeutics development unit at Biogen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;XLRP is a serious, early-onset form of retinitis pigmentosa, and people living with it face almost certain blindness by the end of the fourth decade, commonly leading to loss of independence, depression and unemployment. We are working to further evaluate the data from the XIRIUS study before communicating potential next steps for the cotoretigene toliparvovec clinical development program,&rdquo; she added.</p>

488640,,"Positive data on Ofev in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease","German family-owned pharma major Boehringer Ingelheim has provided important new evidence about the longer-term use of Ofev (nintedanib), which was approved in the USA in September 2019 and in Europe in March 2020 for use in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), a rare autoimmune disease.","<p>German family-owned pharma major Boehringer Ingelheim has provided important new evidence about the longer-term use of Ofev (nintedanib), which was approved in the USA in September 2019 and in Europe in March 2020 for use in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), a rare autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Boehringer today announced results from an analysis of the SENSCIS-ON trial. SENSCIS-ON is an open-label extension trial of the Phase III SENSCIS study to assess the long-term tolerability and safety of Ofev (nintedanib) in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). The study also evaluated the change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC), a measure of lung function, over 52 weeks.</p>
<p>These findings, along with nearly 20 abstracts around interstitial lung diseases, were published online in conjunction with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2021 International Conference. The accepted abstracts are available at <a href=""https://www.thoracic.org/"">https://www.thoracic.org/</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The depth and breadth of research findings from our interstitial lung disease program that we presented at this year&rsquo;s ATS builds on our company&rsquo;s legacy and commitment to respiratory medicine for the past 100 years,&rdquo; said Dr Craig Conoscenti, medical expert and chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease program lead, clinical development and medical affairs, at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p>
<p>Ofev (nintedanib) was the company&rsquo;s second-strongest revenue contributor for the first time last year, with net sales of 2.06 billion euros ($2.5 billion) and growth of 41% (year on year and adjusted for currency effects).&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>SENSCIS-ON</strong></h2>

<p>As reported by The Pharma Letter this week, privately-held Icelandic biopharmaceutical company Alvotech is suing in a bid to end the monopoly that the Chicago-based drugmaker has long-maintained on Humira.</p>
<p>The biologic product is the highest grossing prescription medicine in the USA with more than $16 billion in sales in 2020. Its global revenue last year was nearly $20 billion, though it has lost patent exclusivity in many countries outside the USA.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""AbbVie&rsquo;s Humira patents reflect the ground-breaking work of its scientists and clinical teams""</span>Alvotech wants to bring its copy of the drug, called AVT02, to market, calling it the first-filed biosimilar equal in strength to Humira&rsquo;s latest formulation, which AbbVie markets as a high-concentration, pain-free drug.</p>
<p>AVT02 could save US taxpayers and the overall healthcare system $8 to $10 billion annually, Alvotech claims.</p>
<p>Settlements that allowed launches in 2018 of copies in Europe delayed entry of similar products in the USA until 2023, allowing AbbVie to maintain US exclusivity.</p>
<p>Alvotech accused AbbVie of protecting this exclusivity with a &lsquo;minefield of IP&rsquo; in announcing the filing of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>AbbVie has responded by clarifying that it was the first to file a lawsuit by suing Alvotech on April 27, in the Northern District of Illinois, on four Humira patents.</p>
<p>Alvotech&rsquo;s filing of a declaratory judgement action against those same four patents was made in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>
<p>An AbbVie statement argues: &ldquo;The Virginia lawsuit is duplicative to the first lawsuit AbbVie filed in Illinois two weeks ago. AbbVie&rsquo;s Humira patents reflect the ground-breaking work of its scientists and clinical teams. Many of the Humira patents have been challenged unsuccessfully in IPR proceedings.

<p>This time, the UK health technology assessor, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has approved Keytruda as a first-line treatment option for adults with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancers with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), to be available on the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
<p>The immunotherapy was granted a European license for this patient population in January 2021 and has been recommended by the NICE shortly after, following its first appraisal meeting, said MSD, the trading name of US pharma giant Merck outside the USA and Canada.</p>
<h2><strong>Offers hope to people diagnosed with Lynch syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>David Long, Oncology Business Unit director and MSD UK, commented: &ldquo;We are delighted that NICE has chosen to approve pembrolizumab for patients with metastatic MSI-H/dMMR bowel cancers. This is the first time a licensed immunotherapy has been made available for routine use on the NHS for bowel cancer, and could benefit hundreds of patients every year. This decision particularly offers hope to people diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, who have up to an 80% lifetime risk of bowel cancer, but who carry mutations that mean they are more likely to respond to immunotherapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At MSD, we&rsquo;re committed to getting our innovative new treatments to patients as quickly as possible, and we are pleased to have been able to work effectively with NICE so that they were able to take this decision swiftly for the benefit of patients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

488629,,"Responsible supply chains to combat growing public health threats","An Expert View from Manjit Singh, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative, which tries to foster responsible supply chains, highlighting the issue of antibiotic resistance and the often-underestimated threat coming from the discharge of material in environment.","<p><em>An Expert View from Manjit Singh, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative, which tries to foster responsible supply chains, highlighting the issue of antibiotic resistance (AMR) and the often-underestimated threat coming from the discharge of material in environment.</em></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has shined a spotlight on the importance of maintaining a robust global pharmaceutical supply chain. But combating the novel coronavirus is only one of the reasons we need a more effective, sustainable system for manufacturing and distributing the drugs the world needs.</p>
<p>A critical element in keeping healthy supply chains is addressing the release of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE) and the interlinked potential for the emergence of AMR.</p>
<h2>Improper containment risk</h2>
<p>Most pharmaceuticals enter the environment as patients use and dispose of the medicines they consume. But the drug manufacturing process can also release emissions into the environment, primarily through discharges that elevate concentrations of pharmaceuticals downstream from production facilities.</p>
<p>For example, manufacturing facilities that don&rsquo;t adhere to the best standards can contribute to excessive concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface waters. This can impact aquatic organisms that live in these waters, as well as humans and wildlife that rely on these water supplies.</p>
<p>The improper containment of pharmaceutical antimicrobial agents can also increase the risk of AMR in environmental bacteria, creating superbugs that evade our ability to treat them. While the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in the care chain is the greatest driver of AMR development, high concentrations of antibiotics downstream from poorly managed manufacturing facilities can also contribute to this growing public health threat.</p>
<h2>Need for enforcement of rigorous manufacturing practices</h2>
<p>Over the past two decades, the manufacturing supply chain for medicines has become increasingly global, shifting its focus from the USA and Europe to other hotspots in the world. This process has highlighted the need for enforcement of rigorous manufacturing practices in countries where legislation is less stringent as some organizations in the massive global supply chain lack the expertise and resources to fully contribute to this effort.</p>
<p>Many pharma and biotech companies are actively working to tackle PiE and AMR issues head on, working with their local suppliers and sub-contractors on applying globally the highest manufacturing standards. Manufacturers are fulfilling their responsibilities by making public commitments to reducing emissions, adhering to strong global standards, and calling for greater accountability and enforcement actions by governments.</p>
<p>One example of this ongoing collaboration is the work performed by members of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), 43 of the industry&rsquo;s largest pharmaceutical companies, with drug manufacturers and suppliers to support the implementation of initiatives to limit the growth and spread of PiE and AMR and improve performance against global benchmarks.</p>
<p>These collaborations have benefited local companies as they have seen reductions in operating costs, better regulatory compliance and improvements to their manufacturing processes. Many partners also find that making strong environmental commitments and implementing measures to meet them enhances their reputation across many stakeholder groups, which can lead to new business opportunities.</p>
<h2>Time for collective action</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, to make meaningful progress, we need to focus our collective efforts on three interlinked dimensions: first, we have to continue promoting responsible practices that continuously improve social, health, safety and environmental sustainability across the entire pharmaceutical manufacturing supply chain, including mitigating the impacts of AMR.</p>
<p>Second, we need to bolster education and training efforts, by building knowledge and expertise, and enabling companies to better understand how to calculate the impact of their manufacturing on surface waters and minimize drug releases into the environment. This is critical to cut down on local PiE &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo; and restore surface waters so that there are no adverse impacts on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Finally, further dialogue is needed to increase global awareness of this issue, ensure stakeholders understand and are aligned with appropriate environmental and public health goals, which is why we have recently launched a public position outlining what private sector can do to address PiE and AMR.</p>
<p>AMR is one of the next big threats the world must tackle after COVID-19. To effectively combat the looming threat, we must prioritize working together to strengthen and more responsibly manage global supply chains.</p>","2021-05-14 12:41:00",,"supply, manufacturing, chain, pharmaceutical, chains, environment, responsible, global, public, threat, health, pharmaceuticals, Initiative, issue, waters","An Expert View from Manjit Singh, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative, which tries to foster responsible supply chains, highlighting the issu",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-14 09:00:29","2021-05-14 12:41:43",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/responsible-supply-chains-to-combat-growing-public-health-threats,,,,,,manjit_singh_large.jpg,manjit_singh_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Pharmaceutical supply chain",Pharmaceutical,,"Expert View, Health Medical Pharma, In Depth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The agreement clarifies Faron's intellectual property position in the USA. ahead of any launch of traumakine for the treatment of capillary leak and systemic inflammatory response syndromes (SIRS) including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the USA (subject to marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration).</p>
<p>Faron will pay a small signing-fee, as well as single-digit standard market royalties from future sales of its intravenous (IV) IFN beta-1a (traumakine) in the USA. This sub-licence specifically covers a manufacturing patent valid only in the USA (no corresponding patents exist in other countries) and adds to Faron's existing comprehensive patent portfolio for traumakine which includes use and IV formulation patents, as well as market exclusivity in Europe as an orphan medicine.</p>
<p>Dr Markku Jalkanen, chief executive of Faron, commented: ""We are pleased to agree this sub-licence. We continue to believe in traumakine's potential as a much-needed new treatment for respiratory failure and organ protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faron had chequered clinical trial history with the drug in ARDS in 2018, though later studies were more encouraging, and in March last year the FDA accepted proposed protocol for a new traumakine trial in ARDS. Traumakine has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Promising Innovative Medicines (PIM) designation by the UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>COVID-19 treatment potential</strong></h2>
<p>Dr Jalkanen continued: ""Several recent publications have connected type 1 IFN with the severity of COVID-19 infections. Multiple associations have been drawn across the literature including deficiency of type 1 IFN; inborn errors of IFN-beta signalling; and the presence of auto-antibodies that neutralize the protective effect of type 1 IFN in viral infections. Patients who do not have an early IFN response appear to develop severe disease irrespective of the underlying reason for the deficiency. The continued further evidence supports the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients may become very ill because of an impaired interferon response.</p>
<p>""The administration of IFN is likely to benefit patients and relieve them from the hyper-inflammatory state that leads to severe disease. We believe intravenous administration of IFN-beta is the optimal route to compensate for this loss of first line viral defence and, in tandem induce CD73 a critical enzyme in organ protection during severe illness.""</p>","2021-05-14 12:20:00","Faron sub-licenses US rights to traumakine patent","Faron Pharmaceuticals, Sub-licenses, US patent, Traumakine, ARDS, Respiratory distress syndrome, COVID-19","Faron sub-licenses US rights to traumakine patent",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-14 12:19:18","2021-05-14 12:31:47",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/faron-sub-licenses-us-rights-to-traumakine-patent,,,,,,faron-big.png,faron-small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Respiratory and Pulmonary","Coronavirus, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Patents & Trademarks","Finland, USA","Faron Pharmaceuticals",Traumakine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Presented today at the virtual American Thoracic Society International Conference (ATS 2021), one data analysis showed the initiation of LAMA (long-acting muscarinic antagonist) therapy decreased the escalation rate to triple therapy (long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting &beta;2-agonist (LAMA/LABA) + ICS, which is an inhaled corticosteroid), compared with initiation of LABA/ICS therapy. A second analysis demonstrated no differences in all-cause mortality between LAMA/LABA and triple therapy. The third analysis showed great geographic disparity in how GOLD recommendations are followed.</p>
<p>According to the GOLD recommendations, inhaled bronchodilators, such as LAMAs and LAMA/LABAs, remain the preferred maintenance treatment. GOLD recommends triple therapy as an escalation treatment and not for the initiation of COPD treatment.</p>
<p>GOLD was launched in 1997 in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organizations. The GOLD recommendations for COPD care are shaped by committees made up of leading experts from around the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As part of our 100-year commitment to treating serious respiratory diseases, we strive to ensure patients and their healthcare providers have the information they need to make the appropriate treatment decision, based on the individual needs of each patient,&rdquo; said Dr Thomas Seck, senior vice president of medicine and regulatory affairs at Boehringer Ingelheim. &ldquo;These analyses add to the extensive evidence that supports the GOLD recommendations and the importance of considering GOLD when making treatment decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>The three analyses presented are:</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Assessing the Escalation Time to Open Triple Therapy from Initiation of LAMA vs ICS/LABA in COPD management&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

The guidance provides recommendations to support the biopharmaceutics classification of drug substances and the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based waiver of the <em>in vivo</em> bioequivalence study requirement for drug products.</p>
<p>The BCS-based biowaiver approach is intended to reduce the need for <em>in vivo </em>studies to establish bioequivalence. This can help to reduce unnecessary costs and increase efficiency in generic drug development while continuing to meet the evidentiary standards for bioequivalence to the brand drug. Examples include comparison between products used during clinical development through commercialization, post-approval changes, and applications for generic drug products in accordance with regional regulations. 1</p>
<p>The BCS-based biowaiver is only applicable to immediate release, solid orally administered dosage forms or suspensions designed to deliver the drug to the systemic circulation. Drug products having a narrow therapeutic index are excluded from consideration for a BCS-based biowaiver.

<p>Earlier than anticipated and following Strongbridge&rsquo;s reporting of first quarter earnings results on May 12, 2021, the company received the official Day 74 letter from the FDA. Within the Day 74 letter, the FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of January 1, 2022, which reflects a projected 10-month standard review period. The letter made no mention of a plan to hold an advisory committee meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the FDA's acceptance for filing of the Recorlev New D0rug Application. We believe this decision reflects the comprehensive clinical evidence that went into the NDA submission, including the positive and statistically significant efficacy and safety results from the multinational Phase III SONICS and LOGICS studies evaluating Recorlev as a potential treatment option for adults with endogenous Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome. We are advancing our commercial readiness plans and look forward to potentially bringing a new therapeutic option to the Cushing's syndrome community in the first quarter of 2022,&rdquo; said John Johnson, chief executive of Strongbridge Biopharma.</p>

<p>The data were featured on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Annual Meeting in an oral presentation by Dr Michael Recht, professor of pediatrics, division of hematology and oncology at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University School of Medicine. These data were previously presented at a medical meeting late last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ASGCT presentation highlights these initial HOPE-B data that demonstrate the successful treatment with an AAV5 gene therapy of patients with pre-existing NAbs,&rdquo; stated Ricardo Dolmetsch, president of R&amp;D at uniQure. &ldquo;Patients in the trial who may not have been eligible for other gene therapies because of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies have achieved similar results with etranacogene dezaparvovec compared to those who did not have pre-existing NAbs. We believe this distinguishes etranacogene dezaparvovec as the only hemophilia gene therapy shown in a clinical trial to have the potential to treat nearly all patients, regardless of NAb levels in the generally prevalent range.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Follows FDA clinical hold in December</strong></h2>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration placed a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clinical-hold-on-uniqure-s-hemophilia-b-gene-therapy-program"">clinical hold on uniQure&rsquo;s hemophilia B program</a> following the submission of a safety report in mid-December 2020 of a possibly related serious adverse event associated with a preliminary diagnosis of HCC in one patient in the HOPE-B trial. The hold was lifted last month.</p>
<p>Patients in the Phase III HOPE-B clinical study were initially enrolled into a prospective, observational lead-in period of at least six months during which bleeding events and FIX replacement therapy usage were monitored. All patients required prophylactic routine FIX replacement prior to entering the clinical trial, and patients were not excluded from the trial based on pre-existing NAbs to AAV5.</p>
<p>No clinically-significant correlation of pre-existing NAbs with FIX activity was observed up to a titer of 678, a range expected to include more than 95% of the general population. Mean FIX activity at 26 weeks was 32.7% in participants with NAbs versus 41.3% in those without. A single participant with a NAb titer of 3,212 did not respond and remained on prophylaxis; it is expected that less than 1% of the general population have a pre-existing NAb titer of more than 3,000. All other participants, both with and without NAbs, discontinued prophylaxis and remained prophylaxis-free at 26 weeks.</p>
<p>Etranacogene dezaparvovec has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA access to Priority Medicine (PRIME) regulatory initiative by the European Medicines Agency.

<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Mixed dose schedules could result in an increase in work absences the day after immunization""</span>Writing in a peer-reviewed research letter published in The Lancet, they report that, when given at a four-week interval, both of the &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; schedules (Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Oxford-AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer-BioNTech), induced more frequent reactions following the second, &lsquo;boost&rsquo; dose than the standard, &lsquo;non-mixed&rsquo; schedules.</p>
<p>The researchers add that any adverse reactions were short lived and there were no other safety concerns.</p>
<p>Matthew Snape, associate professor in pediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford, and chief investigator in the trial, said: &ldquo;While this is a secondary part of what we are trying to explore through these studies, it is important that we inform people about these data, especially as these mixed-doses schedules are being considered in several countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results from this study suggest that mixed dose schedules could result in an increase in work absences the day after immunization, and this is important to consider when planning immunization of health care workers. Importantly, there are no safety concerns or signals, and this does not tell us if the immune response will be affected. We hope to report these data in the coming months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a welcome result for the two drugmakers, who last December announced negative results from the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/unexpected-phase-iii-trial-miss-for-novel-asthma-candidate"">Phase III SOURCE</a> trial of tezepelumab.</p>
<p>SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges recently said he assumes tezepelumab will launch in 2022, growing revenues to $1.2 billion by 2025E and $1.8 billion by 2027E (US sales as reported by Amgen).</p>
<h2><strong>Study details</strong></h2>
<p>In one of the pre-specified exploratory analyses of NAVIGATOR, reductions in annualized asthma exacerbation rates (AAERs) were observed over 52 weeks in tezepelumab-treated patients compared to placebo when added to SoC across four patient subgroups, based on blood eosinophil count and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels. Blood eosinophil counts and FeNO levels are two key inflammatory biomarkers used by clinicians to inform treatment options and were defined as blood eosinophil count (&ge;300 or &lt;300 cells per microlitre) and FeNO (&ge;25 or &lt;25 parts per billion).</p>
<p>In patients with elevated baseline blood eosinophil counts (&ge;300 cells per microlitre)&nbsp;and FeNO levels (&ge;25 parts per billion), tezepelumab achieved a clinically meaningful 77% reduction in the AAER, compared to placebo.</p>
<p>In a separate exploratory analysis of exacerbations requiring hospitalizations, tezepelumab showed an 85% reduction over 52 weeks compared to placebo when added to SoC.</p>
<p>Tezepelumab also demonstrated statistically-significant improvements in key secondary endpoints compared to placebo in lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life. Improvements were observed in tezepelumab-treated patients as early as week two of treatment or the first time point assessment and were sustained throughout the treatment period.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>These results build on the NAVIGATOR data <a href=""https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.astrazeneca.com%2Fmedia-centre%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2Ftezepelumab-is-the-first-biologic-to-consistently-and-significantly-reduce-exacerbations-in-broad-population-of-severe-asthma-patients.html/1/0102017964524a79-26b6ebdb-5342-4e6e-8ed9-eb71d859cc69-000000/dWRkTlqYQDgTqTtufxfUZBBJREo=214"">presented</a> in February 2021 which showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful reduction in the primary endpoint of AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population. Clinically-meaningful reductions in AAER compared to placebo were observed in the tezepelumab-treated patients irrespective of blood eosinophil counts, allergy status or FeNO level.</p>

<p>The trial evaluates the immunotherapy as an option for people with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and has a primary efficacy endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR).</p>
<p>Checkpoint believes its candidate is a potential best-in-class PD-L1 blocker, with a unique mechanism of action which removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on certain anti-tumor components of the immune system.</p>
<p>If approved, cosibelimab could differentiate itself from currently marketed options by reactivating an antitumor immune response.</p>

<p>The appointment has been announced just two weeks after Capsida emerged from stealth mode with $140 million of capital, including $90 million from AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), as part of a multi-year strategic collaboration and option agreement.</p>
<p>Dr Tole brings extensive drug development experience including senior-level leadership positions in the biotech industry across a wide spectrum of disease areas including rheumatology, gastroenterology, hepatology, and infectious diseases.</p>
<h2>'Ground-breaking gene therapies'</h2>
<p>She joins from the Roche (ROG: SIX) unit Genentech, where she spent 13 years in roles of increasing responsibility, most recently as vice president of clinical development. In this position, Dr Tole oversaw and advised teams working on several molecules across the gastroenterology and hepatology spaces.</p>
<p>Robert Cuddihy, chief executive of Capsida, said: &ldquo;It is with great pleasure that we welcome Swati to our team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has an impressive and highly relevant track record in biologics and small molecule drug development which complements the existing team. Her deep clinical, scientific, and strategic expertise will be instrumental as we execute on our strategy of using our high-throughput AAV engineering platform to create a pipeline of ground-breaking gene therapies across a range of therapeutic areas for indications that are unreachable with current technologies, with initial focus on the central nervous system.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>'Transformative company'</h2>
<p>Dr Tole said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to join Capsida and to be a part of the growth of such a transformative company. Capsida&rsquo;s AAV platform, with its differentiated capsids and cargos, has the potential to solve many of the challenges in the field today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tribunal has, however, imposed reduced fines of &pound;27.1 million ($38.3 million) on the firms involved.</p>
<p>Paroxetine, the active ingredient of GSK&rsquo;s once blockbuster but now off-patent brands Paxil and Seroxat, is relied on by patients to relieve symptoms of depression. GSK had agreed to make payments totalling &pound;50 million to other generic suppliers of paroxetine, including Generics (UK) Limited (GUK) and Alpharma Limited (Alpharma), in settlement of patent litigation.</p>
<p>In a decision issued in 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that these payments were aimed at delaying the potential entry of these competitors supplying generic medicines into the UK market and were unlawful. The CMA imposed fines totalling &pound;44.99 million on the companies directly involved in the infringements - and, where relevant, on their parent companies or successors to these companies.</p>
<p>In March 2018, the Tribunal dismissed a number of the companies&rsquo; grounds of appeal against the CMA&rsquo;s decision, and referred the remaining grounds to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling on various questions of EU law.

<p>TMS-007 has the potential to be a next generation thrombolytic with an improved benefit-risk profile and the ability to extend the therapeutic window after stroke onset, noted Biogen, which first inked a <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-gets-license-to-target-strokes-with-tms-007"">deal with TMS in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>This decision was based on positive data from a Phase IIa study, which met its primary safety objective. The study demonstrated positive impacts on blood vessel reopening and patient functional recovery with no incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Patients were dosed up to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms; there are currently no approved medical therapies for treatment beyond the 3 to 4.5-hour time window.</p>
<h2><strong>Financial considerations</strong></h2>
<p>Biogen will make a one-time $18 million payment as part of the acquisition of TMS-007. TMS is eligible to receive up to an additional $335 million in potential post-acquisition development and commercial payments should TMS-007 achieve certain developmental milestones and sales thresholds. TMS is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the high single digits to sub-teen percentages on annual worldwide net sales. Biogen will be solely responsible for the costs and expenses related to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of TMS-007 following the acquisition.</p>
<p>Biogen is currently evaluating the next steps for the clinical development of TMS-007, including plans for global studies. Final data results from the Phase IIa study are expected to be communicated at a future scientific forum.</p>
<p>Approved thrombolytic agents are limited in their use due to their benefit-risk profile in later time windows. According to the American Heart Association, intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most feared complication of the current thrombolytic therapy, tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), which works by dissolving blood clots that block blood flow to the brain. In time windows up to 9 hours after stroke onset, sICH has occurred in patients receiving tPA at rates as high as six percent in controlled studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are encouraged by these results and made the decision to acquire TMS-007 based on the totality of the safety, imaging and clinical outcome data from the Phase IIa study,&rdquo; said Alfred Sandrock Jr, head of R&amp;D at Biogen. &ldquo;It has been almost 25 years since the last thrombolytic agent was approved for acute ischemic stroke and we believe this novel investigational drug may expand the number of eligible patients who could potentially receive thrombolytic therapy and thus have a higher chance of functional independence after stroke,&rdquo; he opined.</p>","2021-05-12 15:38:00",,"Biogen, TMS Co, TMS-007, License, Option, Stroke, Ischemic","Biogen buys rights to investigational ‘game-changing’ stroke drug",,1,"Biogen buys rights to investigational ‘game-changing’ stroke drug",1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-12 15:36:39","2021-05-12 15:45:33",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/biogen-buys-rights-to-investigational-game-changing-stroke-drug,,,,,,biogen-big-1.png,biogen-small-1.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Acute ischemic stroke",Biotechnology,Cardio-vascular,"Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing, Research","Japan, USA","Biogen, TMS",TMS-007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The company signed an original licensing <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/in-brief/brief-diurnal-partners-in-china-for-alkindi"">agreement with Citrine in January</a> 2021 for obtaining registration for Alkindi (hydrocortisone granules in capsules for opening) as well as for all commercialization activities in China.</p>
<p>Citrine will be responsible for obtaining registration for Efmody as treatment of patients with the rare conditions congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and adrenal insufficiency (AI) in China and for all commercialization activities, including pricing and reimbursement.</p>
<p>Citrine will initially utilize product from Diurnal&rsquo;s European supply chain, with an option to establish its own supply chain in China in the future. It is estimated that CAH occurs in one in 6,084 births in China. CAH is a group of genetic conditions that limit hormone production in the adrenal glands and was identified a rare disease by the Chinese health authorities in May 2018.</p>","2021-05-12 14:35:00","Diurnal expands deal with Citrine Medicine for Efmody","Diurnal, Citrine Medicine, Efmody, License, Agreement, Registration, Hyperplasia, Adrenal, CAH","Diurnal expands deal with Citrine Medicine for Efmody",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-12 14:33:01","2021-05-12 14:42:48",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/diurnal-expands-deal-with-citrine-medicine-for-efmody,,,,,,diurnal_logo-_big.jpg,diurnal_logo_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Endocrinology, Rare diseases","Asia Pacific, Deals, Focus On, Licensing, Regulation","China, Taiwan, UK","Citrine Medicine, Diurnal Group","Alkindi, Chronocort, Efmody",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488607,,"Alvotech takes on might of AbbVie’s Humira armory","Privately-held Icelandic biopharmaceutical company Alvotech, which is seeking to become one of the leaders in the biosimilar monoclonal antibody market, has made a statement this week by filing a lawsuit against AbbVie.","<p>Privately-held Icelandic biopharmaceutical company Alvotech, which is seeking to become one of the leaders in the biosimilar monoclonal antibody market, has made a statement this week by filing a lawsuit against AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV).</p>
<p>Alvotech is suing in a bid to end the monopoly that the Chicago-based drugmaker has long-maintained on the adalimumab market, sold as Humira.</p>
<p>The inflammatory diseases drug is the highest grossing prescription medicine in the USA with more than $16 billion in sales in 2020. Its global revenue last year was nearly $20 billion, though it has lost patent exclusivity in many countries outside the USA.</p>
<h2>Promise of annual savings of up to $10 billion</h2>
<p>Alvotech has developed a copy of the drug called AVT02, the first-filed biosimilar equal in strength to Humira&rsquo;s latest formulation, which AbbVie markets as a high-concentration, pain-free drug.</p>
<p>The company is also developing AVT02 as an interchangeable product and expects results from its ongoing interchangeability study in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>AVT02 could save US taxpayers and the overall healthcare system $8 to $10 billion annually, Alvotech claims.</p>
<p>Founder and chairman Robert Wessman said: &ldquo;Our new product will be a gamechanger that will provide consumers who are suffering from chronic pain with significant savings, and we look forward to bringing this drug onto the market as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AbbVie will seek to keep this competitor off the market with more than 60 patent claims protecting its exclusivity, though Alvotech has questioned their validity and says that they are part of a series of improper steps taken to inflate the firm&rsquo;s patent portfolio.</p>
<h2>'Minefield of IP'</h2>
<p>Biosimilars to Humira are available across Europe and in Japan, Canada and Australia. Settlement agreements that allowed launches in 2018 of copies in Europe were done to delay launches of similar products in the USA until 2023, allowing AbbVie to maintain and increase prices for US consumers and taxpayers.</p>
<p>In the past four years, AbbVie has reported selling more than $75 billion worth of Humira and is forecast to make an additional sum of nearly $40 billion through 2022.</p>
<p>Alvotech has called AbbVie&rsquo;s strategy a &ldquo;minefield of IP&rdquo;, meaning the company will engage in endless litigation not to protect innovation but to make challenges to its patent claims cost- and resource-prohibitive for competitors.</p>

<p>Revenue reached 4,273 million Danish kroner ($698 million) in the first quarter of 2021, a decline of 2% in local currencies, but ahead of the 4.25 billion kroners expected by analysts polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew 235% compared to the same period in 2020 and reached 882 million kroner. EBIT margin reached 20.6%. Earnings per share (EPS) grew by 578% in the quarter, reaching 3.13 kroner.</p>
<p>The newest product in the portfolio, Vyepti (eptinezumab-jjmr) grew 49% since the fourth quarter of 2020. The brand continues its strong momentum since launch in the second quarter of 2020. Regulatory review is ongoing in 12 markets. Chief Financial Officer Anders Gotzsche said told media on Tuesday that he expected that number to rise to 500 million kroner this year. ""We will accelerate sales and growth this year,"" he said, noting that Vyepti will be launched in six markets during 2021.</p>
<p>Compared to the first quarter of 2020, which benefitted from extraordinary COVID-19 related stocking in several markets, the first quarter of 2021 saw a return to more normal consumer buying patterns seen pre-pandemic. The increased currency depreciation in key markets had an overall negative impact of 4% on sales growth, Lundbeck noted.</p>
<p>President and chief executive Deborah Dunsire commented: &ldquo;Lundbeck continues to deliver robust financial performance in a world impacted by the pandemic still impeding patient&rsquo;s ability to seek care normally. We are very pleased to see good Vyepti growth in the U.S. as we are gradually able to return to more normal interaction with physicians. We are delighted with the new data on Brintellix/Trintellix, amplifying the strength of its profile as a great choice for people facing depression. Currency headwinds have been impactful as has the loss of exclusivity on Northera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The financial guidance for 2021 is maintained. Lundbeck expects revenue to reach DKK 16.3 &ndash; 16.9 billion kroner. Core EBIT is expected to reach 3.1 &ndash; 3.6 billion kroner and EBIT to reach 01.8 &ndash; 2.3 billion kroner.</p>

<p>The agencies announced in March that they have launched a working group, now called the <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-announces-multilateral-working-group-build-new-approach"">Multilateral Pharmaceutical Merger Task Force,&nbsp;</a>to identify concrete and actionable steps to review and update the analysis of pharmaceutical mergers. This project will ensure that FTC investigations include fresh approaches that fully analyze and address the varied competitive concerns that these mergers and acquisitions raise. It taps expertise from competition authorities with whom the FTC cooperates frequently, as well as others with relevant experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public input is critical to the process of refreshing our approach pharmaceutical mergers,&rdquo; said Acting Chairwoman Slaughter. &ldquo;In the face of skyrocketing drug prices and ongoing concerns about anticompetitive conduct by pharmaceutical companies, we need to ensure that our investigations fully capture the potential impact on prices, quality, access, drug supply chain resilience, capital market investment, and innovation for new drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Task Force members encourage the public, including health policy experts, economists, attorneys, scientists, health care practitioners, academics, and consumers, to share ideas that will lead to the development of future enforcement and policy efforts. Accordingly, the Task Force poses these general questions, and encourages the public to submit comments on other issues concerning the effect of pharmaceutical mergers:</p>
<ol>
<li>What theories of harm should enforcement agencies consider when evaluating pharmaceutical mergers, including theories of harm beyond those currently considered?</li>
<li>What is the full range of a pharmaceutical merger&rsquo;s effects on innovation?&nbsp; What challenges arise when mergers involve proprietary drug discovery and manufacturing platforms?</li>
<li>In pharmaceutical merger review, how should we consider the risks or effects of conduct such as price setting practices, reverse payments, and other ways in which pharmaceutical companies respond to or rely on regulatory processes?</li>
<li>How should we approach market definition in pharmaceutical mergers, and how is that implicated by new or evolving theories of harm?</li>
<li>What evidence may be relevant or necessary to assess, and if applicable, challenge a pharmaceutical merger based on any new or expanded theories of harm?</li>
<li>What types of remedies would work in the cases to which those theories are applied?</li>
<li>What factors, such as the scope of assets and characteristics of divestiture buyers, influence the likelihood and success of pharmaceutical divestitures to resolve competitive concerns?</li>

<p>&ldquo;Many people with multiple myeloma develop resistance to existing treatments, so these three new therapies with new mechanisms of action represent a very important expansion of the clinical options available to patients and oncologists,&rdquo; said Dr Steven Pearson, the ICER&rsquo;s president, adding: &ldquo;Data are extremely limited at this time for the two CAR-Ts, and important evidence gaps remain to be filled, but having a new innovative approach become available for patients with multiple myeloma is something to celebrate. Shadowing these new treatments are concerns that the pricing for the first approved CAR-T agent in multiple myeloma exceeds a reasonable level for its given benefit. Manufacturers should restrain their pricing and work with payers to ensure that payment mechanisms and overall benefit coverage can help patients from all walks of life get affordable access to these treatments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belantamab appears to deliver more modest overall clinical benefit, but clinical experts believe it too will have a role in therapy. At its current pricing, belantamab appears to meet commonly cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness, but our independent appraisal committee determined that its long-term value for money was &lsquo;low&rsquo; due to questions about the magnitude of overall survival benefit and certain favorable assumptions within the economic model.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-12 10:20:00","Findings of ICER Final Evidence Report for multiple myeloma therapies","ICER, Final, Evidence, Muliole myeloma, Bristol Myers, bluebird bio, Abecma, Janssen, Legend Biotech, Ciltacabtagene, GlaxoSmithKline, Blenrep","Findings of ICER Final Evidence Report for multiple myeloma therapies",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-12 10:10:06","2021-05-12 10:20:59",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/findings-of-icer-final-evidence-report-for-multiple-myeloma-therapies,,,,,,icer_big.jpg,icer_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Hematology, Immuno-oncology","Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access","UK, USA","bluebird bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, Legend Biotech","Abecma, Blenrep, ciltacabtagene autoleucel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Under the terms of the accord, privately-held MiNA will utilize its saRNA platform to research up to five targets selected by Lilly that aim to address diseases across Lilly&rsquo;s key therapeutic focus areas. Lilly will be responsible for pre-clinical and clinical development of candidates and will retain exclusive commercialization rights for any products resulting from the collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Financial terms of the accord</strong></h2>
<p>MiNA will receive a $25 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive potential development and commercialization milestones up to a total of $245 million per target, as well as tiered royalties from the low-single to low-double digits on&nbsp;product sales resulting from the collaboration. The global research deal could be worth up to $1.25 billion to MiNA, a spokesperson for the company noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small activating RNAs are a promising new technology, which will expand the breadth of Lilly&rsquo;s RNA therapeutics platform and the targets we can pursue,&rdquo; said Andrew Adams, vice president for new therapeutic modalities at Lilly. &ldquo;We are excited about the potential of combining MiNA&rsquo;s leading saRNA platform and our expertise in new modalities to accelerate development of RNA-based medicines in areas of high unmet medical need,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This collaboration with Lilly is an important validation of our saRNA platform,&rdquo; said Robert Habib, chief executive of MiNA Therapeutics, adding: &ldquo;Lilly&rsquo;s expertise in the field of RNA therapeutics and clinical development will greatly enhance our efforts to realize the technology&rsquo;s full potential. Together, we aim to unlock new targets in multiple therapeutic areas and to ultimately move them towards clinical development and commercialization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This transaction will be reflected in Lilly&rsquo;s reported results and financial guidance according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

<p>The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan has approved Zofin for use with a named patient on compassionate grounds following the patient&rsquo;s COVID-19 diagnosis and admittance to an intensive care unit for treatment on a ventilator. Treatment with Zofin will take place at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). The approval by regulators is contingent on the strict adherence to the dosing protocols in use by clinical trial investigators conducting Organicell&rsquo;s ongoing Phase I/II trial for COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Zofin is an acellular, biologic therapeutic derived from perinatal sources and is manufactured to retain naturally occurring microRNAs, without the addition or combination of any other substance or diluent.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Also approved for broader trial</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to this compassionate grounds authorization, Organicell has received further authorization to begin a broader trial of Zofin with up to 60 additional patients suffering from moderate to severe COVID. The company has already shared data with regulatory authorities in the country in support of this effort and hopes to come to an arrangement and commence this trial in the near future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Organicell is dedicated to helping those who suffer from COVID-19 and are hopeful that Zofin0. can continue to help these patients in Pakistan,&rdquo; said Albert Mitrani, chief executive of Organicell. &ldquo;Starting with this first patient who will be treated on compassionate grounds, we are eager for this opportunity to begin the trial which hopefully will lead to a fast authorization of Zofin to be used as the COVID-19 treatment protocol,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Zofin is currently being tested in a Phase I/II randomized, double blinded, placebo trial to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of intravenous infusion of Zofin for the treatment of moderate to SARS related to COVID-19 infection versus placebo.</p>
<p>In April this year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for Organicell&rsquo;s Zofin, in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

<p>The preliminary results show in a larger population than the Phase I study that INO-4800 was generally safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in all studied age groups.</p>
<p>Inovio plans to file the preliminary Phase II results and device data with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Following the submission and receipt of the agency&rsquo;s permission to proceed, the company will conduct the Phase III trial.</p>

<p>Reported revenues at 3,197.8 billion yen (~$28.9 billion), declined by 2.8% impacted primarily by foreign exchange and divestitures. Underlying revenues growth in FY2020 was +2.2% driven by the growth of Takeda&rsquo;s 14 global brands, up 16% year-on-year</p>
<p>Takeda delivered reported operating profit of 509.3 billion yen (~$4.6 billion), which grew 407.2% with gains from non-core asset sales and acquisition-related expenses. Core operating profit, which adjusts for purchase price accounting (PPA) and non-recurring items (including gains on sales of assets), increased year-on-year to JPY 967.9 billion yen (~$8.8 billion). Takeda&rsquo;s reported net profit was 376 billion yen, a 749.9% increase compared with the same period in the prior year.</p>
<h2><strong>FY2021 forecast</strong></h2>
<p>Reported revenue is forecast to be 3,370 billion yen, a year-on-year increase of 172.2 billion yen or +5.4% from FY2020, with underlying revenue momentum and a one-time gain from the sale of diabetes portfolio in Japan fully offsetting impacts from divestitures completed in FY2020.</p>
<p>Underlying core operating profit and underlying core earnings per share (EPS) are expected to also grow at &ldquo;mid-single-digit,&rdquo; reflecting revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies, whilst also incorporating a significant increase in R&amp;D expenses to support Takeda&rsquo;s innovative pipeline.</p>
<p>Christophe Weber, Takeda&rsquo;s president and chief executive, commented: &ldquo;Over the course of FY2020, Takeda remained resilient as we operated in new ways through the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a testament to the dedication of our employees, and Takeda&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to serving patients, our people, and the planet to bring <em>better health for people and a brighter future for the world</em>. We maintained business continuity, ensured patient access to our medicines and safeguarded the health and well-being of our employees while helping to address the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With FY2021 anticipated to serve as a critical inflection year, we remain focused on leveraging our expected top-line growth to ramp up our R&amp;D investment and further fuel our transformative pipeline. We are well-positioned to reach our goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next decade amounting to 5 trillion yen ($47 billion) by FY2030.</p>

<p>Berenberg and Deutsche Bank analysts have previously suggested potential sales for finerenone of $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;An estimated 160 million patients globally are living with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, and they are at high risk of experiencing cardiovascular events, as well as progressing to kidney failure,&rdquo; said Prof Luis Ruilope, Professor at the Cardiorenal Translational Laboratory and Hypertension Unit, Institute of Research imas12, Madrid, Spain, and co-principal investigator of the FIGARO-DKD trial.</p>
<h2><strong>Important insights</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The FIGARO-DKD study delivers important insights into the cardiovascular benefits of finerenone, suggesting its potential to offer physicians a new tool in their armamentarium to protect these vulnerable patients by reducing their risk of cardiovascular events,&rdquo; he added.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor contributes to inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys and heart. With the positive outcome of the composite primary endpoint of the FIGARO-DKD trial, we have reached a significant milestone by completing the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date focusing on chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes across a broad range of disease severity,&rdquo; said Dr Christian Rommel, a member of the executive committee of Bayer's Pharmaceutical Division and head of R&amp;D, adding: ""We are pleased to see that the FIGARO-DKD data further support the evidence generated in the FIDELIO-DKD trial4 with respect to reducing the combined risk of cardiovascular death or non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marketing authorization application (MAA) submitted to the European Medicines Agency, and the new drug application (NDA) accepted by US Food and Drug Administration for Priority Review were based on positive data from the previously completed Phase III FIDELIO-DKD study and are currently under review.</p>

<p>The FDA amended the EUA originally issued on December 11, 2020 for administration in individuals 16 years of age and older.</p>
<p>Pfizer has recently said it expects to apply for authorization for its vaccine for use in toddlers and young children in September and infants in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FDA&rsquo;s expansion of the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age is a significant step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo; said Acting FDA Commissioner Dr Janet Woodcock, adding: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action allows for a younger population to be protected from COVID-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic. Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Incidence of infection in teens</strong></h2>
<p>From March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2021, around 1.5 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years of age have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Children and adolescents generally have a milder COVID-19 disease course as compared to adults. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart, the same dosage and dosing regimen for 16 years of age and older.</p>
<p>The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria to amend the EUA, and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine&rsquo;s use in this population.</p>
<p>Children make up around 20% of the total US population, according to government data, noted CNBC. Between 70% and 85% of the US population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity, experts say, and some adults may refuse to get the shots. Though more experts now say herd immunity is looking increasingly unlikely as variants spread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo; said Dr Peter Marks, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. &ldquo;With science guiding our valuation and decision-making process, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that the available data meet our rigorous standards to support the emergency use of this vaccine in the adolescent population 12 years of age and older,&rdquo; he noted.</p>","2021-05-11 10:58:00","FDA nod for emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in adole","Pfizer, BioNTech,  COVID-19, BNT162b2,  Vaccine, Adolescents, FDA, Emergency use","FDA nod for emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in adolescents",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-11 10:55:31","2021-05-11 11:05:27",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-nod-for-emergency-use-of-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-in-adolescents,,,,,,biontech_vaccine_large.jpg,biontech_vaccine_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Regulation, US FDA",USA,"BioNTech, Pfizer","BNT162b2, COVID-19",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In an earnings call discussing first quarter results, chief executive Stanley Erck said the firm was &ldquo;delayed from where we thought we would be at this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;re giving guidance that nearly all of the major challenges have been overcome and we can clearly see the light at the end of the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Markets responded nervously, sending shares down 10% on Monday and a further 10% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>The vaccine, which is proven by Phase III data to be safe and highly effective, will be submitted for initial approval in the USA, UK and Europe.</p>
<h2>More vaccines needed</h2>
<p>While multiple vaccines against coronavirus have been approved and are in use around the world, there remains a strong need for increased supplies to tackle the outbreak, particularly in lower income countries.</p>
<p>NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant protein vaccine, adjuvanted with Novavax&rsquo; proprietary Matrix-M to enhance the immune response.</p>
<p>Unlike some mRNA-based vaccines, the vaccine does not require special storage conditions and is therefore apt for broad distribution in areas where healthcare infrastructure is not well developed.</p>
<p>Novavax is aiming to hit a production target of 150 million doses per month in the final quarter of 2021, and currently has about 30 to 40 million doses ready for delivery.</p>
<p>On a global basis, the number of new coronavirus infections is at an all-time high of over 800,000, although there are some signs that the current peak may be passing.</p>

488592,,"Global insulin producers losing positions in Russian market","Global insulin producers are losing their positions in the Russian market, due to the active launch of generics by domestic suppliers, according to recent statements by Russian pharmaceutical analysts and local media, reports The Pharma Letter’s local correspondent.","<p>Global insulin producers are losing their positions in the Russian market, due to the active launch of generics by domestic suppliers, according to recent statements by Russian pharmaceutical analysts and local media, reports The Pharma Letter&rsquo;s local correspondent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, according to the Russian Kommersant business paper, citing experts of the Russian analyst agency Headway Company, state contracts signed by the largest Russian supplier of insulin Geropharm more than doubled in 2020 to 1.8 billion roubles ($24.4 million). The bulk of them (1.7 billion roubles) accounted for sales of generics of Lantus (insulin glargine) originated by Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) and Humalog (insulin lispro injection 100 units/mL) from Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).</p>
<p>In the meantime, France&rsquo;s Sanofi and the USA&rsquo;s Lilly have reduced their supplies by 4%, to 9.1 billion roubles and by 2.2 times to 586 million roubles, respectively. The only foreign supplier of insulin that was able to increase shipments was Danish Novo Nordisk, whose sales increased by 3% to 8.8 billion roubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Geropharm increased its share in government purchases of the drug to 10.6%, compared to 4.6% a year earlier. The rest was mainly accounted for by foreign companies. In addition, two more Russian players, Endogenics and Profitmed, expanded into insulin glargine market, selling analogs worth up to 376.5 million roubles in 2020.</p>
<p>According to Sergey Shulyak, general director of DSM Group, Russian suppliers, as a rule, offer a lower price during state purchases, which allows them to therefore increase their share.</p>
<p>Representatives of Eli Lilly Russia also linked the drop in Humalog sales in the Russian market with the launch of its local generics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Insulin import substitution project</strong></h2>
<p>The insulin import substitution project is being implemented in Russia as part of the federal targeted program ""Pharma-2020.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the program, Geropharm in 2017 signed a special investment contract with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the government of St Petersburg for the construction of a plant for the production of insulin. In 2019, the company began the launch of its own versions of the two most expensive analogues of insulins, and last year it started the production of an analogue of aspart, which was previously supplied only by Denmark&rsquo;s Novo Nordisk (NOV: N).&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Russian analysts, while the launch of new generics is restrained by the current patents of foreign companies, Geropharm is close to beginning of production of other insulin analogues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An official spokesman of Geropharm confirmed in an interview with Kommersant that the company plans to expand its portfolio with five more new insulins: insulin aspart two-phase, insulin degludec and insulin glargine in a dosage of 300 units are at different stages from development to registration.</p>
<p>According to analysts, if a new package of preferences for Russian companies in public procurements is adopted, the same Geropharm will be able to supply its drugs for state needs and to withdraw those imported drugs, which are produced from foreign raw materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spokesman of Sanofi also said that the entire line of the company's insulins is produced at a plant in the Oryol region and the products thus have the status of local drugs. The company added that its innovative insulin Toujeo SoloStar was registered in Russia in 2016 and has patent protection until 2031.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Sinovant will assign the license agreement for lefamulin with Nabriva Therapeutics to Sumitomo, which will, in turn, acquire the exclusive development and marketing rights in Greater China for the pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""Sumitomo expects the development assets to contribute to its sustained growth in China and other Asian markets""</span></p>
<p>Sumitomo will also acquire the rights in China for vibegron, RVT-802 and rodatristat ethyl from Sinovant.</p>
<p>Lefamulin has been approved for the indication of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency. It is currently being marketed in the USA under the brand name Xenleta. A Phase III study is currently being conducted in China for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>Vibegron is an oral, once-daily, small molecule &beta;3 adrenergic receptor agonist. Urovant Sciences, a consolidated subsidiary of Sumitomo, obtained the approval for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency in adults from the FDA in December 2020. The drug is currently being marketed by Urovant in the USA under the brand name Gemtesa. A development plan in China is currently being evaluated.</p>
<p>RVT-802, a one-time regenerative therapy, is cultured human thymus tissue engineered to generate a functioning immune response when implanted in pediatric patients with congenital athymia. In the USA, Enzyvant Therapeutics, a consolidated subsidiary of Sumitomo, has resubmitted the Biologics Licensing Application to the FDA for RVT802, for pediatric congenital athymia, in April 2021.</p>
<p>Again, a development plan for RVT802 in China is currently being evaluated, as it is for rodatristat ethyl, a prodrug of tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor designed to reduce peripheral production of serotonin without entering the brain. In the USA, Altavant Sciences, another consolidated subsidiary of Sumitomo, is conducting a Phase IIb study of the candidate in pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>
<p>Under a strategic alliance agreement concluded with Roivant in 2019, Sumitomo obtained options to acquire ownership interests in six of its subsidiaries, including Sinovant and Genevant Sciences.</p>
<p>Sumitomo will now terminate its five remaining options to acquire Roivant&rsquo;s ownership interest in its subsidiaries as part of this transaction. In addition, it will make a payment to Sinovant as consideration for the agreement.</p>

<p>The Abingworth Clinical Co-Development Fund 2 (ACCD 2) was significantly oversubscribed, exceeding its target of $350 million, and closed at its hard cap.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""This new CCDF that, combined with our $465 million ABV 8 fund, brings new funds closed by Abingworth in 2021 to over $1 billion""</span>Alongside the recent $465 million Abingworth Bioventures 8 (ABV 8) fund, Abingworth has raised more than $1 billion in new funds to invest in life science companies in the USA, UK and continental Europe developing innovative therapeutics with potential to significantly improve human health.</p>
<p>The ACCD 2 fund provides finance for the development of late-stage clinical programs from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. ACCD 2 will invest directly in late-stage product financing opportunities, as well as through its co-development portfolio companies Avillion in the UK, and SFJ Pharmaceuticals in the USA.</p>
<h2>Big pharma partnerships</h2>
<p>Avillion and SFJ finance and facilitate clinical trial execution, using their operational expertise to increase the speed and quality of the trials. They incur all the clinical and regulatory risk and receive a pre-negotiated return once the drug is approved.</p>
<p>UK-headquartered Abingworth boasts that it pioneered the clinical co-development investment strategy in 2009, investing initially via its venture funds and then alongside the first dedicated fund &ndash; Abingworth Clinical Co-Development Fund (ACCD 1), which launched in 2016.</p>
<p>To date, Abingworth has made 11 investments in co-development opportunities through Avillion and SFJ. Of the seven that have completed, six resulted in pre-negotiated pay-outs to the fund and five resulted in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals.</p>
<p>Partnerships with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Apellis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: APLS), Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) and PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: PHAS) are ongoing.</p>
<h2>New appointments</h2>
<p>As part of the new fund closing, James Cornwall, has joined Abingworth as partner in charge of business development for clinical co-development deals and will work alongside the investment partners. Dr Cornwall has more than 25 years&rsquo; pharmaceutical and contract research organization (CRO) industry experience, including roles in clinical research and corporate development.</p>
<p>He was formerly with Nuvelution, a structured finance investment vehicle, and Quintiles, a global CRO that is now part of IQVIA (NYSE: IQV).</p>
<p>In addition, David Simmons, chairman and chief executive of US CRO PPD (Nasdaq: PPD) and former Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) executive, has been appointed as a senior advisor to Abingworth, focusing on its clinical co-development strategy.</p>
<h2>'New medicines in reduced time'</h2>
<p>Kurt von Emster, managing partner, said: &ldquo;Our bespoke clinical co-development approach has succeeded as an alternative investment strategy since we pioneered the concept a decade ago, both in terms of generating returns for investors and gaining new product approvals. Our CCD program enables biotech companies to avoid near-term equity dilution and enables resource constrained pharma companies to pursue additional clinical projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we expand our CCD efforts, we have augmented the team and are very pleased to welcome David Simmons and James Cornwall, whose breadth of pharma and CRO expertise will be important as we continue to execute this approach in the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim Haines, chairman and managing partner, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to announce this new CCDF that, combined with our $465 million ABV 8 fund, brings new funds closed by Abingworth in 2021 to over $1 billion.</p>

<p>The expansion comes after the founding in 2020 of a USA-based headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The company has made headlines during the coronavirus pandemic, partnering with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) to develop the first approved vaccine for the disease, dubbed Comirnaty.</p>
<p>BioNTech has a broad portfolio of oncology candidates, including individualized and off-the-shelf mRNA-based therapies, as well as innovative immuno-oncology treatments, targeted cancer antibodies and small molecules.</p>
<h2>Pandemic ready</h2>
<p>As well as a new regional base, the firm aims to establish a fully integrated manufacturing facility to boost global supply capacity for its pipeline of mRNA-based product candidates.</p>
<p>The new site would also enable the company to offer a rapid response production capability for south east Asia, to address potential pandemic threats in the future.</p>
<p>With automated and end-to-end mRNA production capabilities across drug substance, drug product and fill-and-finish, BioNTech is targeting an annual capacity of several hundred of million doses of vaccines, enough to make a significant contribution in the event of a viral outbreak.</p>

<p>Under this accord, the Japanese government will secure the antibody cocktail for the year 2021 for domestic supply, if it is approved by the regulatory authority in Japan.</p>
<p>The antibody cocktail combining two virus-neutralizing antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, was developed by USA-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: REGN) for the potential treatment and prevention of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Chugai&rsquo;s majority owner Roche (ROG: SIX) and Regeneron announced a collaboration to develop, manufacture and distribute the antibody cocktail. In December of the same year, <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/chugai-in-licenses-antibody-cocktail-for-covid-19-from-roche"">Chugai obtained development righ</a>ts and exclusive commercialization rights in Japan for the antibody cocktail from Roche.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, including the spread of infections of variants, has been persistent, and new treatment options continue to be pursued. The two potent virus-neutralizing antibodies administered together, bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus spike protein, which may neutralize the activity against SARS-CoV-2 and protects against spike variants currently circulating in the human population.</p>
<h2><strong>Phase I trial in Japan initiated </strong></h2>
<p>Several overseas clinical trials have been conducted for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. In Japan, a Phase I clinical trial has been initiated in March of this year to examine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in Japanese.</p>
<p>Chugai says it will continue to collaborate with the Japanese government to ensure appropriate and timely supply of the antibody cocktail upon regulatory approval.</p>
<p>This matter is not included in the earnings forecast for the fiscal year 2021 announced on February 4, 2021. No changes are expected to Chugai&rsquo;s financial prospects at this time, but we will promptly disclose any events that should be disclosed in the future, the company noted.</p>
<p>In January this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) said they will purchase up to 1.25 million additional doses of the casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail for use in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to meet the federal government's Operation Warp Speed goals. The agreement has a value of up to $2.625 billion.

<p>Men diagnosed with mHSPC tend to have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of approximately three to four years underscoring the need for new treatment options.</p>
<p>With this indication, enzalutamide is now the only oral treatment approved by the EC to treat three distinct types of advanced prostate cancer &mdash; non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and mHSPC. The EC approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase III ARCHES trial which evaluated enzalutamide in men with mHSPC.</p>
<h2><strong>Currently limited options</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients have limited options and, unfortunately, there is a poor prognosis for many men,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Armstrong, Professor of Medicine, Surgery, Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Director of Research in the Duke Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers and lead investigator of ARCHES, adding: &ldquo;The research supporting this approval provides clinical evidence showing how enzalutamide can help improve outcomes for men with mHSPC, which gives healthcare professionals in Europe the option to offer the treatment across the advanced prostate cancer disease continuum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Data from the ARCHES trial showed enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 61% versus placebo plus ADT in men with mHSPC (n=1,150; hazard ratio [HR]=0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.50]; P&lt;0.0001).<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Enzalutamide has been an established standard of care for men with advanced prostate cancer and has been prescribed to more than 610,000 patients worldwide since it was first approved in 2012,&rdquo; said Dr Andrew Krivoshik, senior vice president and global therapeutics, area head, Oncology Development, Astellas. &ldquo;This new indication for enzalutamide provides men with mHSPC a much-needed, additional therapy option earlier in their treatment journey.

<p>Last week saw Novartis&rsquo; Sandoz unit on Monday announce it is progressing the development of biosimilars to Bayer and Regeneron&rsquo;s blockbuster ophthalmic drug Eylea. Also of note, the US medicine cost watchdog, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), issued a draft report questioning the benefit/risk of Biogen and Eisai&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease candidate aducanumab. And Roivant Sciences entered into a $7.3 billion SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) deal with Montes Archimedes to go public. Marking an important new indication for Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s Keytruda, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the blockbuster drug for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer.</p>
<h2><strong>Sandoz Phase III plans for Eylea biosimilar is a win for Regeneron</strong></h2>
<p>Novartis&rsquo;s generic and biosimilar division, Sandoz, last Monday confirmed late-stage development <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/progress-on-proposed-biosimilars-of-eye-drugs-eylea-and-lucentis"">plans for an Eylea biosimilar</a>. Novartis confirmed that it will be required to complete a Phase III safety and efficacy study comparing their biosimilar to Regeneron&rsquo;s Eylea, noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>He regards this as a stringent bar for approval of a biosimilar, and basically eliminates the possibility of accelerated approval based on bioequivalence. Moreover, it is by no means certain that Sandoz&rsquo; biosimilar will be non-inferior. If there are any severe adverse event (ocular) imbalances between the active and control arms, the biosimilar may never come to market, he said.</p>
<p>Safety events with unknown origin (believed to be formulation or manufacturing components) with Novartis&rsquo;s Beovu and previously with Allergan&rsquo;s abicipar pegol resulted in slightly higher rates of such events, and then either commercial or development failure. Mr Porges expects Novartis&rsquo; MYLIGHT study will face relatively slow enrollment compared to other studies, since participants must accept a year of treatment with an unproven medicine as a condition of participation, and it is unlikely that the FDA will accept an exclusively or largely non-US study to be the basis of approval.</p>
<p>That being said, he believes Sandoz&rsquo;s reputation as a quality generic and biosimilar manufacturer and its clinical trial experience and network should result in the trial being completed and the product approved most likely around 2024 or 2025. Assuming MYLIGHT begins enrollment imminently, he estimates the biosimilar could potentially reach the market no sooner than 2024.</p>
<p>Leerink currently estimate 2024 and 2025 US Eylea revenue of $5.5 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, with year-on-year growth of -5% and -4%. At this stage it forecasts biosimilars entering the market in 2021 (likely a Lucentis biosimilar), and beyond 2025 forecasts US Eylea revenue erosion of 4%-19%/year. Mr Porges believes the loss in sales of Eylea will come as much from the entry of competitors with products that can extend treatment intervals, such as Kodiak&rsquo;s KSI-301 (approval expected in 2023). He believes Eylea&rsquo;s share loss to the biosimilar should be minimal since he expects the biosimilar to be priced at a discount to the branded product (initially 20-30% discount, ie, $1,295-$1,480 per month) rather than at the price of the compounded Avastin ($50 per monthly dose).</p>
<h2><strong>ICER, unconvinced by Biogen data, suggests low price for Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug</strong></h2>
<p>Clinical trial results used by Biogen to apply for US approval of its experimental <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/icer-questions-aducanumab-s-health-benefit-in-early-price-review"">Alzheimer's drug aducanumab</a> are ""insufficient"" to determine whether treatment would actually help patients, according to an influential non-profit that assesses the value of new medicines, according to Ned Pagliarulo writing on BioPharma Dive.</p>
<p>Any benefit observed in human testing of the drug is highly uncertain, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said in a preliminary report released Wednesday, pushing back against several of Biogen's explanations for why two near identical late-stage studies of aducanumab had conflicting outcomes.</p>
<p>The ICER's conclusions are another knock against the treatment, which has divided Alzheimer's researchers and doctors ever since Biogen <a href=""https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-submit-fda-alzheimers-drug-aducanumab/565538/"">controversially declared</a> one of the trials a success just months after judging both <a href=""https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-alzheimers-aducanumab-clinical-failure-halt/551004/"">unlikely to meet their goals</a>. Aducanumab is now under review for at the Food and Drug Administration, with a decision on approval expected by June 7.</p>
<p>The FDA worked closely with Biogen to reinterpret the initial study findings using additional data following Biogen's March 2019 decision to discontinue both studies. But last November a panel of independent advisers to the agency overwhelmingly rejected Biogen and the FDA's case for aducanumab, creating new doubt about the result of the regulator's review, said Mr Pagliarulo.</p>
<p>Critics, including several members of the FDA advisory committee that met last November, have emphasized this point and noted both Biogen and the regulator appear to be assuming the negative trial missed aducanumab's benefit, rather than being a true result.</p>
<p>The ICER also calculated the cost-effective price for scenarios that assume ""optimistic"" and ""conservative"" treatment benefits. The former scenario relies only on the positive study results, in which case aducanumab could be priced between $11,100 and $23,100 and still be cost-effective. The latter assumes only patients with mild cognitive impairment benefit from treatment, reducing the cost-effective range to between $1,200 and $4,200.</p>
<p>Biogen has kept its plans for pricing aducanumab close, although it appears the company has decided on a number. ""I think that we are there,"" company chief executive Michel Vounatsos said on <a href=""https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-aducanumab-review-uncertain-launch/598890/"">a recent earnings call</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Roivant rewrites the SPAB script, again</strong></h2>
<p>Just when it seemed that Immunovant, the SPAC poster child, was about to disprove the rationale behind this business model, its <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/roivant-merging-with-montes-archimedes-to-go-public-in-7-3-billion-spav-deal"">parent company, Roivant</a>, has moved to rewrite the script by gaining a private listing of its own &ndash; via a SPAC, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>The deal will give Roivant another $556 million, to bring net cash up to $2.3 billion. However, anyone thinking that this is a sign of Vivek Ramaswamy relinquishing control of Roivant will be in for a shock: even after the complex quadripartite SPAC transaction that will give it a public listing, Roivant will be 86% held by the investors who currently own it privately.</p>
<p>Thus, the main purpose of reversing into the special-purpose acquisition company currently known as Montes Archimedes Acquisition Corp appears to be to value Roivant publicly by listing a minority stake. The deal also allows cash reserves to be topped up, and Silicon Therapeutics, a separate entity being acquired, to be integrated.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about a SPAC transaction is that it lays bare, for regulatory compliance reasons, the precise sources of funding and resulting equity shares above.</p>
<p>It also details the precise ownership status and attendant obligations of the transaction&rsquo;s subject. Thus this deal shines a light into the Roivant stable of companies, around which there had previously been a little less clarity.</p>
<h2><strong>A surprise Keytruda approval, and what it means for biotech</strong></h2>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s surprising <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-accelerated-approval-to-keytruda-for-her2-positive-gastric-cancer"">US approval of a Keytruda/Herceptin/chemo triple combo</a> that few had even realized had been filed shines a light on data from its supporting Keynote-811 study. The trial&rsquo;s results were to be presented for the first time at ASCO next month, but thanks to Keytruda&rsquo;s new label they can be seen today, commented Jacob Plieth on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>The data concern remission rates, and show a benefit versus Herceptin and chemo alone, an important fact that could affect development strategies from biotechs including Pieris and Silverback. And, of course, the unexpected approval allows Keytruda to compete against Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s Opdivo in an important setting.</p>
<p>The US green light, on an accelerated basis, concerns first-line HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In April, Opdivo was approved in this cancer with no stipulation about HER2 status, but its label stresses that the supporting study, Checkmate-649, excluded HER|2-positive patients.</p>
<p>Leerink analysts reckon some 10,000 gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma patients are treated first line each year, and around a quarter are Her2-positive, which amounts to a $300m market.</p>
<p>Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch called the go-ahead a &ldquo;positive surprise&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s based on interim tumor response data. The approval keeps Keytruda in the stomach cancer market, which has become increasingly important for makers of PD-1/L1 inhibitors, she said in a Wednesday note to clients.</p>
<p>Although Opdivo&rsquo;s and Keytruda&rsquo;s approvals give them separate markets divided by HER2 status, Dr Graybosch suggested patient selection will come down to physician preference. &ldquo;We believe physicians and payers would view Opdivo and Keytruda as interchangeable in setting,&rdquo; Dr Graybosch said in the note.</p>
<p>Mr Plieth noted that the result is relevant not only for Merck and Bristol Myers, but also for several other companies testing the combination of Her2 inhibition with immune system stimulation. This includes CD3-targting T-cell engagers, as well as a more recent generation of so-called immune-stimulatory antibody conjugates, or Isacs.</p>
<p>The latter group includes <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/snippets/aacr-2021-pieris-might-have-bet-combinations"">Pieris&rsquo;s troubled cinrebafusp</a>, which adds 4-1BB co-stimulation to HER2 blockade, Innovent&rsquo;s IBI315, a straight HER2 x PD-1 directed bispecific, and a trio of ADCs from Bolt Therapeutics, Silverback and Novartis that use TLR7 and/or TLR8 agonism for immune system stimulation, he noted.</p>","2021-05-09 10:52:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 7, 2021","News review, Novartis, Sandoz, Eylea, Biosimilars, Biogen, Eisai, Aducanumab, Roivant, Montes Archimedes, Merck & Co, Keytruda","Look back at pharma news in the week to May 7, 2021",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-09 10:51:04","2021-05-09 11:05:35",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-may-7-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biosimilars, Biotechnology","CNS Diseases, Immuno-oncology, Neurological, Ophthalmics","Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Drug Trial, Focus On, Pricing, reimbursement and access, Regulation, Research, US FDA",,"Biogen, Eisai, Merck & Co, Montes Archimedes Acquisition, Novartis, Roivant Sciences, Sandoz","aducanumab, Eylea (aflibercept Injection, Keytruda",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The new drug application was previously granted priority review by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) in July 2020. BeiGene says it is preparing to launch pamiparib this month.</p>
<p>In August 2018, the NMPA approved AstraZeneca's (LSE: AZN) Lynparza (olaparib) for the maintenance treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, making it the first targeted therapy approved for the indication in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s NMPA approval makes pamiparib the third BeiGene internally discovered and developed medicine to receive marketing authorization, an incredible company milestone validating our scientific innovations,&rdquo; commented Xiaobin Wu, president, chief operating officer, and general manager of China at BeiGene. &ldquo;With a broad commercial portfolio of seven medicines covering 15 indications across hematological malignancies and solid tumors in China, our science-based commercial team is well-positioned to serve patients in need. BeiGene will continue working to advance our broad, diverse pipeline and executing on our mission of expanding access to and improving affordability of impactful treatments for patients worldwide,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2>Clinical backing</h2>
<p>The NMPA conditional approval of pamiparib for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is based on clinical results from a pivotal Phase II portion of the Phase I/II trial (NCT03333915). A total of 113 patients in China with high-grade, non-mucinous, epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian or primary peritoneal cancer), harboring gBRCA mutations, following at least two prior lines of standard chemotherapy, were enrolled in the pivotal Phase 2 portion of the trial, including 90 patients with advanced platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC), and 23 patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC).</p>

488575,,"The continuing quest to get more women on life sciences boards","Catherine Owen, senior vice president of major markets at Bristol Myers Squibb, provides an Expert View on why increasing female representation on corporate boards isn’t just a numbers game. Women bring diverse perspectives that are needed more than ever.","<p><em>Catherine Owen, senior vice president of major markets at Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), provides an Expert View on why increasing female representation on corporate boards isn&rsquo;t just a numbers game. Women bring diverse perspectives that are needed more than ever.</em></p>
<p>For decades, as women fought for a &ldquo;seat at the table&rdquo; in the world&rsquo;s centers of corporate power, they were still largely excluded from one of the most important tables of all: the one in the boardroom.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s been some remarkable progress in correcting this imbalance in just the last five years. In 2016, the UK government pledged to increase gender representation in boards of directors in the nation&rsquo;s top 350 companies.</p>
<p>According to the Hampton-Alexander review that was released in February, women now hold one third of board positions&mdash;a number that rose to 1,026 from 682 directors.</p>
<p>Yet the British life sciences industry still has a way to go. Although the report recognized GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) for their commitment to board diversity, a 2020 survey of 132 biotech, pharma and medtech companies by Liftstream, a UK life sciences executive search firm, tells a different story.</p>
<p>Among 70 publicly-listed companies and 62 privately-held ones, women made up just 15% of board directors. Most shockingly, 41% of those companies have all-male boards.</p>
<p>We must do better. During a time when board oversight matters more than ever to help companies navigate economic and industry upheaval, boards need a council of leaders with a mix of superpowers.</p>
<p>That calls for including directors with varying skillsets, big-picture perspectives, knowledge bases and collaborative styles. That also means ensuring that women make up a significant percentage of life sciences boards, rather than just &ldquo;checking the box&rdquo; by bringing on a single &ldquo;token&rdquo; woman. In acknowledging the value that women bring to boardrooms, I prefer not to think of their contributions as simply &ldquo;female&rdquo; ones.</p>
<p>Rather, they bring a diversity of thought that often facilitates more creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that the Hampton-Alexander review found that such inclusion is good for business: companies that ranked in the top 25% for gender diversity on their executive teams were 25% more likely to be more profitable than those in the lowest quarter.</p>
<p>Companies need to strive for such gender balance in both their boardrooms and executive ranks. This is especially the case in the British life sciences industry, where women account for only 21% of executive leadership roles.</p>
<h2>Overcoming the last barriers</h2>
<p>So how do we improve representation overall? We must continue to encourage more women to consider management positions. That&rsquo;s how they gain the breadth of experience that many companies value in board members. More recently, the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic, including working from home while taking care of children, have discouraged some women from gunning for positions that bring them more responsibility.</p>
<p>As an industry, we must make sure this is a temporary setback; we simply can&rsquo;t afford to lose decades of progress in gender parity. We must double-double down on our efforts to support, hire and retain women leaders, whether through formal recruitment or informal mentorship.</p>
<p>As for promoting board representation specifically, the good news is that there are several organizations leading the cause. Some non-profit, academic and industry groups offer &ldquo;board ready&rdquo; training programs that educate women about board opportunities in life sciences companies and help match them with board openings.</p>
<p>Examples are Harvard University, which offers online courses designed to support Women on Boards (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/programs/women-on-boards), and Non Executive Directors on Boards in the UK, which provides training and support (https://www.nedonboard.com).</p>
<p>Also, other global corporate actors are sending clear signals that women&rsquo;s inclusion on boards should simply be expected. For example, Goldman Sachs announced at the World Economic Forum last year that it will not take any company public that doesn&rsquo;t have gender diversity on its boards. So why are the life sciences still lagging so far behind?</p>
<h2>Putting boards on women&rsquo;s radars</h2>
<p>Women need to step up, too. I want to set the record straight about a particularly powerful myth that often discourages women from seeking out board opportunities. Many women I&rsquo;ve spoken with believe they&rsquo;re not qualified to serve on boards because companies are seeking only women with extensive corporate resumes and high visibility.</p>
<p>First, that&rsquo;s just not true. Companies value candidates with many kinds of life and business experience.</p>
<p>Second, there are many paths to get there: many people opt to serve for non-profit or charity boards before inquiring about positions at public and private companies. That&rsquo;s why I encourage women to be brave, raise their hands and be open to many kinds of service.</p>
<p>I got a great start by serving on the board of a local mental health organization that helped veterans with PTSD find housing. In fact, that&rsquo;s where I learned a ton about fundraising best practices. I&rsquo;ve also been on boards for a hospital system and chamber of commerce before taking my current position on the board of a US pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>All of these opportunities gave me different perspectives and skills that helped me in my board and professional careers. And of course, serving on a board is personally rewarding.</p>
<p>Board members add immeasurable value to companies and organizations trying to solve some of the world&rsquo;s most difficult problems. Our participation matters. Your voice matters.</p>
<p>This is a unique time in history when more women are being invited to sit at bigger and more important tables. We must insist that all companies pull out their chairs&mdash;and encourage more women to take their rightful place.</p>","2021-05-07 18:14:00",,"women, boards, board, companies, life, sciences, representation, bring, corporate, directors, perspectives, industry, gender, executive, female, diversity","Catherine Owen, senior vice president of major markets at Bristol Myers Squibb, provides an Expert View on why increasing female representation on corporate boa",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-07 17:49:12","2021-05-08 14:13:52",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/the-continuing-quest-to-get-more-women-on-life-sciences-boards,,,,,,catherine_owen_bms_large.jpg,catherine_owen_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,,"Boardroom, Expert View, In Depth, Management",,"Bristol-Myers Squibb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Puralid Lipogel has been launched to date in Austria, Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, with further launches expected across Europe in the coming months.</p>
<p>A survey commissioned by Santen of blepharitis patients across three European countries revealed that current treatments are not providing full relief for some of the most severe and frequent symptoms experienced &ndash; including dry eyes and red, itchy and irritated eyelids.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was revealed that only 17% of people were fully satisfied with their blepharitis treatment.</p>
<p>Edoardo Villani, University of Milan, Italy, said: &ldquo;Blepharitis is a common and symptomatic disease and it has no established cure. It&rsquo;s therefore crucial that we recognize that this condition needs a careful diagnostic approach and personalized management, and that we continue to educate patients on the value of lid hygiene, such as using warm compresses and cleansing the eyelids daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we know that some patients struggle with current hygiene options and that even mild forms of blepharitis will only be successfully managed if patients persevere.</p>
<p>Luis Iglesias, president and head of Santen, added:&nbsp;&ldquo;Blepharitis can be sore, troublesome, uncomfortable and irritating for people so it can have a serious negative impact on quality of life.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA will be set once the BLA is complete and formally accepted for review by the agency.</p>
<p>Pfizer and BioNTech also have submitted an application to expand the current EUA for their COVID-19 vaccine to include individuals 12 to 15 years of age. The companies intend to submit a supplemental BLA to support licensure of the vaccine in this age group once the required data six months after the second vaccine dose are available.</p>
<p>Last month, the companies also applied to the European Medicines agency to gain approval for Comirnaty use in children. And, earlier this month, Health Canada became the first regulator to approve the vaccine for adolescents.</p>
<h2><strong>Others seeking pediatric use of their vaccines</strong></h2>
<p>Meantime, Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) has been conducting a trial in children over 12 with its COVID-19 vaccine, while AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) has a UK-based pediatric trial of its option, Vaxzevria, but this is currently on hold due to in a few incidents of blood clots associated with the vaccine.</p>
<p>Comirnaty (BNT162b2) has already generated record-breaking sales in the adult population, and is forecast to have peak sales of $24.8 billion for 2021. Along with its first-quarter 2021 results, Pfizer revealed that the vaccine recorded revenues of $3.5 billion for the three-month period.</p>
<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is currently available in the USA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA on December 11, 2020. Since then, the companies have delivered more than 170 million doses of the vaccine across the USA. Submission of a BLA, which requires longer-term follow-up data for acceptance and approval, is the next step in the rigorous FDA review process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer and BioNTech initiated the BLA by submitting the non-clinical and clinical data needed to support licensure of the COVID-19 vaccine for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. This includes <a href=""https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious"">the most recent analyses</a> from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial, where the vaccine&rsquo;s efficacy and favorable safety profile were observed up to 6 months after the second dose. The companies will submit the required manufacturing and facility data for licensure in the coming weeks to complete the BLA.&nbsp;</p>

488570,,"European regulator reiterates safety of coronavirus vaccines","Minutes from the May meeting of the European Medicines Agency’s safety committee show the panel has reaffirmed the positive benefit-risk ratio of approved coronavirus vaccines.","<p>Minutes from the May meeting of the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s safety committee show the panel has reaffirmed the positive benefit-risk ratio of approved coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p>The EMA&rsquo;s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) met over three days at the start of May, with safety advice relating to vaccines from Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX), AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) among the topics for discussion.</p>
<p>The PRAC is charged with evaluating safety signals from the use of the vaccines, as part of Europe&rsquo;s pharmacovigilance efforts.</p>
<h2>Blood clotting</h2>
<p>The possibility that certain viral vector-based vaccines could be associated with an extremely rare form of blood clotting has been discussed for several weeks by public health authorities in European countries and in the USA.</p>
<p>Following reports of a small number of cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after vaccination with Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s jab, several countries have limited its use to older demographics, for whom the benefit-risk calculation is more certain.</p>
<p>J&amp;J&rsquo;s option has also been associated with cases of CVST, although no definite causal connection has been established in either case.</p>
<p>In its discussions, the PRAC reaffirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and refined safety warnings to include advice that patients who are diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within three weeks of vaccination should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis.</p>
<p>The PRAC is closely monitoring whether mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) options might also be linked to such blood clotting.</p>
<p>The panel concluded &ldquo;at this stage that there is no safety signal for the mRNA vaccines,&rdquo; with &ldquo;only a few cases of blood clots with low blood platelets&rdquo; having been reported.</p>
<p>In addition, the PRAC concluded that &ldquo;these cases do not seem to present the specific clinical pattern observed with Vaxzevria and COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;the current evidence does not suggest a causal relation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Other safety reports</h2>
<p>As part of the review of the regular pandemic summary safety reports for Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Covid-19 vaccine, the PRAC is analyzing data on cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).</p>
<p>With respect to Comirnaty, the first coronavirus to receive regulatory approval, developed by New York&rsquo;s Pfizer and German firm BioNTech, the panel considered that there is &ldquo;at least a reasonable&rdquo; chance of an association with reported cases of facial swelling in people who have used dermal fillers, and recommended that the label be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>The PRAC is also assessing reports of myocarditis with Comirnaty and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. On all such matters, the EMA advised that it will communicate further when new information becomes available.</p>","2021-05-07 14:26:00",,"safety, vaccines, European, PRAC, coronavirus, cases, blood, panel, committee, benefit-risk, reaffirmed, reports, reiterates, regulator, approved, vaccine","Minutes from the May meeting of the European Medicines Agency’s safety committee show the panel has reaffirmed the positive benefit-risk ratio of approved coron",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-07 14:26:30","2021-05-07 15:09:07",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/european-regulator-reiterates-safety-of-coronavirus-vaccines,,,,,,europe_flag_eu_big.jpg,europe_flag_eu_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, Public health, Regulation","Europe, UK, USA","AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer","Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, mRNA-1273, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Sotrovimab is under development at UK pharma major GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and USA-based partner Vir Biotechnology (Nasdaq: VIR).</p>
<p>The rolling review will continue until enough evidence is available to support a formal marketing authorization application. The EMA will assess the medicine&rsquo;s compliance with the usual standards for efficacy, safety and quality. While the overall review timeline cannot be forecast yet, the process should be quicker than a regular evaluation due to the time gained during the rolling review.</p>
<p>The review of the data is being carried out by the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The decision to start the rolling review is based on the interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase III COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which evaluated sotrovimab as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization. Results of the interim analysis, based on data from 583 randomized patients, demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalizations over 24 hours or deaths in those receiving sotrovimab compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial.</p>
<h2><strong>Review also under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004</strong></h2>
<p>Separately, the CHMP is also reviewing sotrovimab under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004 and is expected to provide European Union-wide recommendations for national authorities who may take evidence-based decisions on the early use of the medicine, ahead of any formal marketing authorization.</p>
<p>Sotrovimab is an investigational compound and has not been granted a marketing authorization anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for sotrovimab has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sotrovimab is also under review by other global regulators including Health Canada under the expedited Interim Order application pathway for COVID-19 drugs.</p>","2021-05-07 13:50:00","GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology","GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology, Sotrovimab VIR-7831, COVID-19, EMA, Rolling, Review","EMA starts rolling review of sotrovimab for early treatment of COVID-19",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-07 13:49:30","2021-05-07 13:57:27",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/ema-starts-rolling-review-of-sotrovimab-for-early-treatment-of-covid-19,,,,,,vir-biotechnology-large.png,vir-biotechnology-small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases","Coronavirus, European Medicines Agency, Focus On, One to Watch Companies, Regulation","Europe, UK, USA","GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology","sotrovimab, VIR-7831",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The committee has reviewed the latest available evidence, including the current COVID-19 infection rate, the scale and pace of the vaccine programme and modelling of the timing and size of any third pandemic wave.</p>
<p>This has been considered alongside the latest advice from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on extremely rare cases of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which now carries that trade name Vaxzevria.</p>
<p>The chances of a younger person becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 get smaller as infection rates increasingly come under control in the UK.</p>
<p>Considering this alongside the portfolio of vaccines available in the UK in the coming months and taking a precautionary approach in relation to the extremely small risk of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the JCVI has advised a preference for adults aged 30 to 39 without underlying health conditions to receive an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine &ndash; where available and only if this does not cause substantial delays in being vaccinated.</p>
<p>This follows the decision on April 7 to offer a preference for adults aged under 30.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit/risk more finely balanced for younger people</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Commenting on the announcement, Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: &ldquo;Our position remains that the benefits of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca against COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalization and death, continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. The balance of benefits and risks is very favorable for older people but is more finely balanced for younger people and we advise that this evolving evidence should be taken into account when considering the use of the vaccine, as JVCI has done.&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>Adverse events following the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are extremely rare and, for the vast majority of people, the benefits of preventing serious illness and death far outweigh any risks.</p>
<p>Up to April 28, 2021, the MHRA had received 242 reports of blood clotting cases in people who also had low levels of platelets in the UK, following the use of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. These numbers are very small compared to the millions of people who have received the vaccine. The overall incidence of case reports of thromboembolic events with low platelets after first or unknown doses was 10.5 per million doses. The majority of these extremely rare events occurred after the first dose.</p>","2021-05-07 12:17:00","JCVI advises on COVID-19 vaccine for under 40-year-olds","AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, COVID-19, JCCVI, MHRA, Advise, Under, 40-year-olds, Risk, Benefit","JCVI advises on COVID-19 vaccine for under 40-year-olds",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-07 12:14:23","2021-05-07 12:23:14",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/jcvi-advises-on-covid-19-vaccine-for-under-40-year-olds,,,,,,mhra_large.png,mhra_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation",UK,AstraZeneca,"COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Net income came in at $1.1 billion, an increase of 78% on the same period of 2020, a little over $10 per share following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</p>
<p>Chief executive Leonard Schleifer said the result reflected the firm&rsquo;s evolution into &ldquo;a company with multiple durable product lines helping people with a range of serious diseases including COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking to diversify around cornerstone product Eylea (aflibercept), Dr Schleifer noted progress in oncology, where the firm is launching Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) in advanced basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p>
<p>Regeneron also recently announced positive pivotal data for the therapy in cervical cancer, and is planning regulatory submissions later in the year.</p>
<h2>Revenue drivers</h2>
<p>Several large cap biotechs have reported a disappointing start to the year, with notable exceptions including coronavirus vaccine developers Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ).</p>
<p>Regenereon too has played a role in combating the novel coronavirus, with antibody cocktail REGEN-COV (casirivimab/imdevimab) securing emergency approval to treat the disease in the USA.</p>
<p>The therapy, which has continued to demonstrate efficacy against coronavirus variants, took in $262 million in first-quarter sales.</p>
<p>The company also recently reported positive Phase III results for REGEN-COV in both the COVID-19 outpatient treatment and prevention settings, and is working with regulatory authorities to bolster access.</p>

<p>The Imfinzi plus chemotherapy arm demonstrated a statistically-significant improvement in PFS versus chemotherapy in the previous analysis, but the OS trend observed in this analysis&nbsp;did not achieve statistical significance. Patients in the control arm were treated with up to six cycles of chemotherapy, while those in the experimental arms were treated with up to four cycles.</p>
<p>Each combination demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified. The combination with tremelimumab delivered a broadly similar safety profile to the Imfinzi and chemotherapy combination and did not lead to an increased discontinuation of treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>New approach will add a further option</strong></h2>
<p>Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, Oncology Business Unit, said: &ldquo;We are pleased to see the POSEIDON Phase III trial demonstrate, for the first time, a significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit for Imfinzi plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We were particularly pleased by the safety profile.

488561,,"What a difference a year makes for Moderna","A 23,650% first quarter revenue increase makes clear the level of fiscal impact a successful coronavirus vaccine can have.","<p>A 23,650% first quarter 2021 revenue increase makes clear the level of fiscal impact a successful coronavirus vaccine can have.</p>
<p>Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) has gone from zero to $1.7 billion in revenues, with an additional $200 million or so in grant money from the US government and others - up from around $4 million in first-quarter 2020.</p>
<p>Overall revenues were a little below what most analysts had forecast, and the firm has been faced with manufacturing setbacks. Like other novel coronavirus vaccine developers, Moderna has striven to hit ambitious production targets from a standing start.</p>
<p>However, boosted by the distribution of over 100 million doses of mRNA-1273, the firm&rsquo;s first commercial product, net income was $1.2 billion for the three-month period.</p>
<p>That compares with a net loss of $124 million for the same quarter in 2020 and translates to an earnings per share (EPS) figure of $3.05 - up from a 35 cent loss per share.</p>
<p>Chief executive St&eacute;phane Bancel noted that the company&rsquo;s first ever profitable quarter was based on &ldquo;10 years of scientific innovation and several billion dollars invested to make our mRNA platform a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Coronavirus vaccine</h2>
<p>Understandably, much of the focus in the first quarter for Moderna has been on output of its coronavirus vaccine, mRNA-1273, which is now forecast to reach between 800 million and 1 billion doses in 2021.</p>
<p>The Cambridge, USA-based company has said it will make additional investments to increase global supply up to three billion doses in 2022.</p>
<p>Mr Bancel said Moderna was &ldquo;now actively engaged in discussions and agreements for 2022 with all of the governments we are currently supplying for 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;On top of that, new partnerships, like COVAX, for up to 466 million doses in 2022 and discussions with new governments in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, make us believe that our total advance purchase agreements for 2022 should be higher than those in 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With rising concern about the potential for new vaccine-beating variants of the novel coronavirus to emerge, Moderna is also developing versions of its vaccine against such threats.</p>
<p>New data shows a single booster dose of mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351 increased neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 and two variants of concern in previously vaccinated trial participants.</p>
<p>The company is also testing the vaccine in younger and more vulnerable demographics, in order to extend access in the population.</p>
<h2>Broader research efforts</h2>
<p>While the messenger RNA (mRNA) specialist has attracted global headlines due to the success of its coronavirus vaccine program, Moderna has a wide range of candidates in its portfolio, 14 of which are in clinical studies.</p>
<p>With a 24 candidate-strong R&amp;D program covering infectious diseases and rare diseases, one highlight from the first quarter was positive seven-month interim data from a Phase II study of cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate mRNA-1647.</p>
<p>The firm also announced positive interim data from a Phase I study of RSV vaccine candidate mRNA-1345 in younger adults.</p>","2021-05-06 17:10:00",,"vaccine, Moderna, coronavirus, quarter, million, billion, mRNA-, increase, doses, difference, year, impact, fiscal, level, clear, revenue, successful, shar","A 23,650% first quarter revenue increase makes clear the level of fiscal impact a successful coronavirus vaccine can have.",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-06 17:09:26","2021-05-06 21:26:41",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/what-a-difference-a-year-makes-for-moderna,,,,,,moderna_big.jpg,moderna_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Rare diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Financial, Focus On, Management",USA,Moderna,"mRNA-1273, mRNA-1345",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Sonelokimab, for which MoonLake gained rights to earlier this week from Merck KGaA (MRK: DE), is an investigational interleukin (IL)-17A/IL-17F inhibitor with an albumin binding site, which has the potential to facilitate deep tissue penetration in the skin and joints<sup>.</sup> It has clinically demonstrated potential to allow better disease control in dermatology and rheumatology patients. Sonelokimab showed impressive efficacy with a favorable safety profile, and numerically outperformed active control secukinumab, Novartis&rsquo; (NOVN: VX) Cosentyx.</p>
<p>In the study, dosages up to 120mg showed rapid and significant clinical benefit compared with placebo. In the highest dosage group, almost six out of 10 patients (57%) achieved total skin clearance (PASI 100 response) after 24 weeks. Rapid response was demonstrated with one of three patients already achieving almost clear skin (PASI 90 response) by week 4.</p>
<p>Analysis of an individualized dosing scheme including off-drug periods in controlled patients revealed durable responses over one year. Sonelokimab was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the active control, secukinumab, and an overall candida rate of 7.4%. Although the highest dosage and schedule could be used for future clinical studies, additional assessment and modelling may aid in the final selection of the optimal dosage and schedule.</p>
<p>The trial was conducted by Avillion LLP under a 2017 co-development agreement with Merck.</p>
<h2><strong>Game-changing potential</strong></h2>
<p>Investigator Dr Kristian Reich, chief scientific officer and co-founder of MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, commented: &ldquo;Sonelokimab is a remarkable Nanobody with game-changing potential in the treatment of a range of IL-17A/F-driven inflammatory diseases. This study shows very high response levels in the model disease psoriasis, with a favorable benefit-safety profile. MoonLake&rsquo;s aim is to also accelerate Sonelokimab&rsquo;s development in other inflammatory diseases driven by IL-17A and IL-17F like psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Our aim is to elevate treatment goals in these diseases based on the unique characteristics of Sonelokimab, giving patients with common and burdensome skin and joint conditions a chance of better disease control.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-06 16:19:00","Impressive Phase IIb data for MoonLake’s sonelokimab","MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, Sonelokimab, Phase IIb","Impressive Phase IIb data for MoonLake’s sonelokimab",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-06 16:17:48","2021-05-07 11:04:26",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/impressive-phase-iib-data-for-moonlake-s-sonelokimab,,,,,,moonlake_large.png,moonlake_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Dermatologicals,"Drug Trial, One to Watch Companies, Research",Switzerland,"MoonLake Immunotherapeutics",sonelokimab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Aducanumab, which is being developed by US biotech Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Japanese drugmaker Eisai (TYO: 4523), could become the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline in patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""This treatment has important side effects""</span>A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision on aducanumab is expected in June. This preliminary draft marks the midpoint of the ICER&rsquo;s iterative process of assessing the evidence on aducanumab, and the ICER has stressed that these findings should not be interpreted as its final conclusions.</p>
<p>David Rind, ICER&rsquo;s chief medical officer, said: &ldquo;Nearly everyone has been touched by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease through its effects on family members, friends, colleagues, or themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a condition that people dread like no other, and the first therapy that effectively cures or stops the progression of the disease will warrant a very high price in the US health system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the clinical trial history and evidence regarding aducanumab are complex, and we believe that at the current time the evidence remains insufficient to determine whether the drug provides an overall health benefit. This is an area of tremendous unmet need, but this treatment has important side effects, and its wide use would have important ramifications for patients and health care budgets, making it all the more important that we know whether a therapy like aducanumab is, or is not, effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the ICER&rsquo;s preliminary judgment is that substantial uncertainty remains regarding the health benefits of aducanumab, a base-case cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the combined results from the two contradictory Phase III randomized trials.</p>
<p>Results showed estimates of small overall health gains commensurate with value-based prices at traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds between $2,500 and $8,300 per year.</p>
<p>The report also includes draft calculations for multiple additional scenarios based on differing assumptions about the data on effectiveness of treatment. If the evidence is judged as suggesting no health benefit for aducanumab, then its value-based price would be $0. In the optimistic scenario, which only considers the favorable pivotal trial and disregards the negative study, the health gains for patients could support an annual price for aducanumab between $11,100 and $23,100.</p>
<p>The ICER also calculated what a fair price would be for a hypothetical chronic maintenance therapy that halted the progression of dementia but did not cure Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>Although the budget impact would be considerable for Medicare and other US payers due to the large potential patient population, such a treatment could be priced between $50,000 and $70,000 per year and still meet commonly cited thresholds for long-term cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>With the threat from new variants of the virus ever present, there are also concerns that rising numbers of cases globally could provide the conditions for a vaccine-beating mutation to develop.</p>
<p>COVID-19 infections are still increasing in 42 countries, with a global total of over 150 million cases so far. India is currently reporting close to 400,000 new cases per day.</p>
<p>Anna Marriott, health policy manager at Oxfam, said that the current approach to vaccination had &ldquo;so far denied access to these life-saving tools for billions of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;As thousands of people die daily in India, the continued failure of the G7 to break with the pharma-controlled monopolies is inexcusable.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Industry reaction</h2>
<p>Vaccine developers have been ramping up production, promising significant increases in supply in the coming months.</p>
<p>This includes Moderna, which recently announced plans to manufacture up to three billion doses of its mRNA-based product in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite this, the lack of availability in the short and medium term has prompted countries to support the IP waiver, proposed by India and South Africa, which would pave the way for unbranded versions of leading vaccines to be developed.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry has criticized the move, however, questioning whether checks on quality and safety could guarantee the products.</p>
<p>The industry is also concerned that the waiver would remove incentives for companies to continue researching new variants, diagnostics and treatments, while making it less likely that the private sector would react quickly in the event of another pandemic.</p>
<p>Nathalie Moll, director general of European pharma trade group EFPIA called the decision &ldquo;short-sighted&rdquo; and &ldquo;ineffectual,&rdquo; adding it would put &ldquo;the hard-won progress in fighting this terrible disease in jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;While we wholeheartedly agree with the goal of protecting citizens around the world through vaccines, waiving patents will make winning the fight against the coronavirus even harder.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-06 12:39:00",,"coronavirus, vaccines, countries, trade, vaccine, intellectual, property, waiver, world, U-turn, COVID-, backed, patents, surprise, Government, proposal","To the surprise of many, the US Government has backed a World Trade Organization (WTO) proposal to disclaim certain intellectual property (IP) rights to coronav",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-06 12:12:58","2021-05-06 12:41:32",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/us-u-turn-could-see-coronavirus-vaccine-patents-set-aside,,,,,,biden_big-1.jpg,biden_small-1.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Biden administration, Coronavirus, Focus On, Government Affairs, Legal, Patents & Trademarks","Global, USA","AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer","Comirnaty, mRNA-1273, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Inspira&rsquo;s research focuses on proprietary IPX formulations, which are based on processed and purified extracts from a plant source. These extracts contain proteolytic enzymes that have been shown to rapidly inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus <em>in vitro</em>. The IPX technology platform has additional potential applications in other lung infections and treatment of biofilms associated with respiratory disease.</p>
<p>To date, Vectura, whose shares gained 3.4% to 117,69 pence on the new, has undertaken a feasibility study on Inspira&rsquo;s inhaled IPX formulation candidates with positive results. This new agreement will see the company perform further testing and development work, to prepare initially for Phase I clinical studies using its FOX vibrating mesh nebulizer to deliver the IPX formulations directly to the lungs.</p>
<p>Inspira chief executive Rory McGoldrick commented: &ldquo;We are delighted to have partnered with Vectura, a company with a strong track record in the successful development of pharmaceuticals for respiratory indications. Leveraging Vectura&rsquo;s expertise and network, Inspira is well placed to accelerate the development of our novel IPX formulations for pulmonary delivery. As we move from pandemic to endemic COVID-19 it will be ever more important to have new treatments that are cost effective, easy to distribute and easy to administer. We are targeting a treatment that has the potential to be effective at the early phase of infection, to minimise the risk of hospitalization and reduce the need for ventilatory support in intensive care. We hope that our human clinical trials of IPX formulations will prove as successful as our initial laboratory studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vectura chief commercial officer Mark Brigewater added: &ldquo;The work carried out by Inspira demonstrates the potential to develop a highly-effective treatment for COVID-19, and our initial studies show that our FOX nebuliser offers an extremely efficient delivery method. We are excited to continue supporting Inspira on this lead programme&rsquo;s development towards the clinic, combining our expertise of formulation and device development with Inspira&rsquo;s innovative research to add to the treatments available to manage this global pandemic disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All studies will be undertaken at Vectura&rsquo;s Chippenham, UK facility, which is home to advanced pharmaceutical development laboratories, manufacturing suites and offices where the company&rsquo;s differentiated technology and skills are used to develop customers&rsquo; inhaled products, from high quality generics to novel therapies.</p>","2021-05-06 12:25:00","Vectura and Inspira to develop potential inhaled COVID-19 treatment","Vectura, Inspira Pharmaceuticals,COVID-19 treatment, Inhalded","Vectura and Inspira to develop potential inhaled COVID-19 treatment",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-06 12:24:52","2021-05-06 12:34:29",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/vectura-and-inspira-to-develop-potential-inhaled-covid-19-treatment,,,,,,vectura-logo-big.jpg,vectura-logo-small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"Infectious diseases, Respiratory and Pulmonary","Coronavirus, Deals, Focus On, Research",UK,"Inspira Pharmaceuticals, Vectura",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Market reaction to the news was a &lsquo;Tale of two cities;&rsquo; Chiasma shares rocketed up more than 40% to $3.98 by close of trading on Wednesday, while Amryt dipped 2.5% and plunged a further 10.3% to 174.98 pence in early trading today.</p>
<p>The combined company will be a global leader in rare and orphan diseases with three on-market commercial products, a global commercial and operational footprint and a significant development pipeline of therapies with the financial flexibility to execute its growth plans. The transaction has been approved and recommended by the boards of both Amryt and Chiasma. The deal expected to pave a path to a combined potential $1 billion peak revenue for Amryt.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the transaction, each share of Chiasma common stock issued and outstanding prior to the consummation of the transaction will be exchanged for 0.396 Amryt American Depositary Shares (ADSs), each representing five Amryt ordinary shares. As of the close of trading on May 4, 2021 Amryt&rsquo;s ordinary shares on AIM were &pound;2.00 ($2.78) per share and Amryt&rsquo;s ADS&rsquo;s on Nasdaq were $12.95 (&pound;9.31) per ADS.</p>
<h2><strong>Product portfolio</strong></h2>
<p>The combined business will have three approved commercial products, lomitapide (Lojuxta/Juxtapid), metreleptin (Myalept/ Myalepta, octreotide (Mycapssa) and a robust clinical pipeline, with the leading investigation candidate being Oleogel-S10 (proposed trade name Filsuvez) under regulatory review in the USA and European Union to treat junctional and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB).</p>
<p>Amryt already has in place the infrastructure, expertise and the financial flexibility to realize the full potential of Mycappsa, a treatment for in acromegaly, globally and further develop life-cycle management opportunities to expand the benefits of Mycapssa to other patient populations including NET. The transaction is expected to accelerate and diversify Amryt&rsquo;s growing revenues and Amryt expects to deliver estimated annual cost synergies of approximately $50 million.</p>
<p>Based on the fixed exchange ratio, Amryt shareholders prior to the transaction will own around 60% of Amryt post transaction and Chiasma shareholders prior to the transaction will own about 40% of Amryt post transaction.</p>
<h2><strong>Amryt financial guidance</strong></h2>
<p>Separately, Amryt said it was increasing its own revenue guidance for the current year (2021) after a record first quarter. Sales rose by 8.7% to $48.4 million helped by good sales of both metreleptin and lomitapide.</p>

<p>Using data from the international MSBase registry, the findings published in Neurology, revealed that women with MS who continued to take natalizumab through and after their pregnancy, had a decrease in relapse rates by up to 89%.</p>
<p>Natalizumab was brought to market by Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) under the brand name Tysabri.</p>
<h2>'Incredibly valuable evidence'</h2>
<p>The study found that women with MS who stopped taking natalizumab and another therapy, fingolimod, before conception had an increase in relapse rates.</p>
<p>Fingolimod is sold under the name Gilenya by the Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NOVN: VX).</p>
<p>Led by senior research fellow Vilija Jokubaitis from the department of neuroscience at Monash Central Clinical School, the study is the first to show how well the disease can be controlled through and after pregnancy if women are appropriately managed on disease-modifying therapies.</p>
<p>Dr Jokubaitis said: &ldquo;Pregnant women are excluded from randomized-controlled trials of disease-modifying therapies and there is limited trial evidence to inform management through pregnancy and postpartum. Being able to analyse this data is incredibly valuable in providing evidence to change practice in clinical management of women with MS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past, women were advised to stop taking any MS medications in order to conceive. However, with such variability in how long conception might take, women were at increased risk of their disease activity returning while trying to become pregnant, often with terrible neurological consequences for the mother.</p>
<h2>Significant increase in MS treatments</h2>
<p>First author Wei Yeh, who is also a neurologist at The Alfred hospital, added: &ldquo;Relapse rates were previously thought to decrease during pregnancy among women with MS. However, our study shows that this is not the case for a subset of women with more active disease, who experience increases in relapse rates during pregnancy. These observations are important to guide our discussions and treatment strategy with the aim of minimizing relapse risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study incorporated 1,619 women with MS who had 1,998 pregnancies conceived from 2011 onwards. This group was then compared to pregnancies conceived before 2005 up to 2010, looking at relapse rates before, during and after pregnancy to see how relapse rates and use of disease modifying treatment have changed over time, as there has been a significant increase in the number of more effective MS treatments over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>Among the first was natalizumab, which was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004 and then later in Australia in 2006, before receiving reimbursement the following year. Other newer treatments include fingolimod, which won Australian approval in 2011, and dimethyl fumarate, a drug sold by Biogen under the name Tecfidera that was approved in Australia in 2013.</p>","2021-05-05 16:24:00",,"women, study, pregnancy, pregnant, relapse, benefit, rates, disease-modifying, treatment, Monash, natalizumab, Tysabri, disease, finds, multiple, continue","A study by Australia’s Monash University has highlighted the benefit for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who continue to take a disease-modifying tr",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-05 16:13:21","2021-05-05 17:16:49",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/study-finds-tysabri-benefit-in-pregnant-women-with-ms,,,,,,monash_big.png,monash_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,"CNS Diseases, Neurological, Women's health","Drug Trial, Real-world evidence, Research","Australia, Switzerland, USA","Biogen, Novartis","dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, Gilenya, Natalizumab, Tecfidera, Tysabri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>The company also announced the appointment of Dr Roger Perlmutter as its new chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Eikon&rsquo;s drug discovery platform evolved from super-resolution microscopy, a ground-breaking approach to elucidating the behavior of proteins in live cells. Super-resolution microscopy was first developed by Eric Betzig, and collaborators, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014 for this work. Dr Betzig, Xavier Darzacq, Luke Lavis, and Robert Tjian, founded Eikon to industrialize this novel technology and to apply the tracking of protein dynamics to key applications across the drug discovery process.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Eikon, Dr Perlmutter was an executive vice president at Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) and president of Merck Research Laboratories. Under his R&amp;D leadership, Merck received more than 100 regulatory approvals for its medicines and vaccines globally, including those for multiple cancers, diabetes, and infectious diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pharmaceutical industry has long been limited in the tools available to study dynamic regulatory mechanisms in living cells,&rdquo; said Dr Perlmutter, adding: &ldquo;In this context, it is inspiring to see what Eikon has already accomplished by incorporating physics and engineering along with machine learning to complement traditional drug discovery approaches. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to work with Drs Betzig and Tjian, whom I have known for many years, and with the engineers, computer scientists, chemists and biologists at Eikon, with whom I have interacted during the past year, to identify and develop important new therapeutics.&rdquo;</p>","2021-05-05 12:31:00","Merck's Perlmutter joins start-up; closes $148 million Series A","Eikon Therapeutics, Launches, Financing, Series A, Appointment, Roger Perlmutter, CEO,","Merck's Perlmutter joins start-up; closes $148 million Series A",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-05 12:30:43","2021-05-05 12:36:14",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-s-perlmutter-joins-start-up-closes-148-million-series-a,,,,,,boardroom-large-1-.jpg,boardroom-small-1-.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,,"Boardroom, Business Financing, Companies, mergers and acquisitions, Management",USA,"Eikon Therapeutics, Merck & Co",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>Cocrystal initiated its COVID-19 program in March 2020 and has since expanded the program with additional development and licensing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are aggressively developing novel coronavirus protease inhibitors for COVID-19 prophylactic and therapeutic use,&rdquo; said Sam Lee, president of Cocrystal, adding: &ldquo;These drug candidates bind to a highly conserved region of the active site of SARS-CoV-2 protease that is required for SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Our high-resolution x-ray cocrystal structures further confirmed the specific covalent interaction with this conserved region of the proteases of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that, due to their novel mechanism of action, our protease inhibitors are likely to be effective against new variants of SARS-CoV-2. This may include the recent variants first identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India, which may be more contagious forms of the virus and may evade immunity produced by vaccines or previous infection,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Lead candidate CDI-45205</strong></h2>
<p>In December 2020, Cocrystal announced the selection of CDI-45205 as its lead coronavirus development candidate among a group of protease inhibitors obtained under an exclusive license agreement with Kansas State University Research Foundation (KSURF) announced in 2020.</p>
<p>CDI-45205 showed good bioavailability in mouse and rat pharmacokinetic studies via intraperitoneal injection, and also no cytotoxicity against a variety of human cell lines. The company recently demonstrated a strong synergistic effect with the Food and Drug Administration-approved COVID-19 medicine remdesivir. Additionally, a proof-of-concept animal study demonstrated that daily injection of CDI-45205 exhibited favorable <em>in vivo</em> efficacy in MERS-CoV-2 infected mice. Cocrystal has obtained promising preliminary pharmacokinetic results and is continuing to further evaluate CDI-45205.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The immediate next steps in the process of advancing this candidate toward clinical development require scale-up synthesis and the subsequent manufacture of several kilograms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to support Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and Phase I trials,&rdquo; said Dr Lee. &ldquo;Similar to our influenza CC-42344 program, we are exploring multiple routes of administration of preclinical lead molecules including oral, inhalation and injection. We will also be examining <em>in vitro</em> activities of our compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 variants.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Enters $40 million stock offering deal</strong></h2>
<p>Cocrystal also yesterday announced that it has entered into an underwriting agreement with H C Wainwright &amp; Co, under which the underwriter has agreed to purchase on a firm commitment basis 26,000,000 shares of common stock of the company, at a price to the public of $1.54 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about May 7, 2021, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p>
<p>The gross proceeds to Cocrystal, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, are expected to be around $40 million. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for the expansion of its COVID-19 and influenza treatment development programs and general corporate purposes and working capital.</p>","2021-05-05 10:57:00","Cocrystal Pharma soars on update of its COVID-19 antiviral programs","Cocrystal Pharma, COVID-19, Antiviral programs, CDI-45205, SARS-CoV-2, Stock offering","Cocrystal Pharma soars on update of its COVID-19 antiviral programs",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-05 10:56:09","2021-05-05 11:03:50",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cocrystal-pharma-soars-on-update-of-its-covid-19-antiviral-programs,,,,,,cocrystal_big.jpg,cocrystal_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,"Antiviral drugs",Biotechnology,Anti-virals,"Business Financing, Coronavirus, Focus On, Research",USA,"Cocrystal Pharma",CDI-45205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>As part of this, the company will establish full cycle-production of vaccines at its plant in the Kirov region as well as a R&amp;D center for biotechnological drugs in Moscow. So far, these plans have been recently confirmed by the president of Nanolek Vladimnir Khristenko. According to him, this will allow the company to triple the current portfolio of vaccines by 2025 and increase its share of public procurements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, the company does not have its own production of vaccines, producing the poliomyelitis vaccine together with the Dutch firm Bilthoven Biologicals. The company also cooperates with French drug major Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) by conducting secondary packaging of its pentaxim vaccine, preparing for the launch of the production of a finished dosage form.</p>
<p>The increase of vaccines production is an acute need for Nanolek, which also due to the existing state requirements for suppliers to establish their own production of vaccines until 2035.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts also believe the latest investment plans of Nanolek will be beneficial to its foreign partners and will ease access to public procurements in Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Mr Khristenko, most of the allocated funds will be invested in the equipment of the firm&rsquo;s R&amp;D centers in Moscow, as well as the purchase of new equipment for the production of biotechnological active ingredients at its plant in the city of Kirov. Finally, part of the funds will be invested in the conduction of clinical trials of the HPV vaccine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2022 Nanolek plans to launch the production of Sanofi&rsquo;s vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal infection, as well as to launch production of a vaccine against pneumococcal infection of the South Korean SK Bioscience.</p>
<p>According to the Russian analyst agency Headway Company, in 2020 state tenders for the purchase of pneumococcal vaccine in Russia reached 12.9 billion roubles in value terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, Nanolek plans to produce up to four of its vaccines, among which are a vaccine for the prevention of shingles as well as COVID-19 (no earlier than 2024). The development of two other vaccines is ongoing, but the company has not disclosed information on them yet. In addition, this autumn it will begin clinical trials of a vaccine against human papillomavirus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This followed the company&rsquo;s update on its regulatory plans for AVR-RD-01, the first investigational lentiviral gene therapy for Fabry disease.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""We believe we have a potential new path to pursue full approval for investigational AVR-RD-01 as a first-line therapy for Fabry disease""</span>The update came as a result of a recent regulatory development for a rival Fabry disease therapy, as well as Avrobio&rsquo;s receipt of minutes from the company&rsquo;s Type B meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 31.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2021, approximately three weeks before the company&rsquo;s end-of-Phase I meeting, the FDA granted full approval of Sanofi&rsquo;s (Euronext: SAN) Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta), more than 18 years after the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) received accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint: reduction of GL-3 inclusions in biopsied renal peritubular capillaries (PTCs).</p>
<p>The conversion of Fabrazyme to full approval opens a new pathway for full approval of ERTs based on this surrogate endpoint, which Avrobio believes could potentially apply to investigational AVR-RD-01.</p>
<p>In addition, the conversion of Fabrazyme to full approval limits the accelerated approval pathways available for new therapies to treat Fabry disease.</p>
<p>As a result, Avrobio has said that it can no longer pursue an accelerated approval pathway for AVR-RD-01 with the FAB-GT trial as currently designed, and instead intends to discuss with the FDA a registration trial with a primary efficacy endpoint of clearance of GL-3/Gb3 inclusions in biopsied renal PTCs as the basis for full approval.</p>
<p>Geoff MacKay, chief executive and president of Avrobio, said: &ldquo;We believe we have a potential new path to pursue full approval for investigational AVR-RD-01 as a first-line therapy for Fabry disease by conducting a single, head-to-head registration trial versus Fabrazyme using a kidney biopsy surrogate endpoint similar to our FAB-GT Phase II trial, where we have seen 100% and 87% substrate reductions at one-year post-gene therapy in the two patients with evaluable kidney biopsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We plan to design a registration trial with a scope, size and duration comparable to other gene therapy trials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In its FDA briefing book, which was submitted to the agency prior to Fabrazyme&rsquo;s full approval, the company sought an accelerated approval pathway by expanding the FAB-GT Phase II trial and conducting an additional confirmatory study.</p>
<p>The revized regulatory plan anticipates retaining the two-study approach with a similar overall requirement in terms of scope, size and duration.</p>
<p>Avrobio plans to agree upon its revized approach with the FDA, with the goal of initiating the registration trial in mid-2022.</p>
<p>Although FDA guidance provides that a surrogate endpoint in a particular clinical development program should not be assumed to be appropriate for use in a different program, Avrobio believes this recent development could potentially apply to investigational AVR-RD-01, a gene therapy designed to facilitate the production of functional enzyme by the patient&rsquo;s own stem cells after a one-time treatment with the therapeutic gene.</p>
<p>Avrobio also remains on track to request a CMC-oriented Type C meeting in the second half of 2021. Additionally, in parallel the company intends to seek scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency on the planned registration trial.</p>
<p>At the same time, the FAB-GT trial continues to progress. A total of six patients have now been dosed, including two in the past two months, and additional participants are enrolled in the study.</p>

<p>Following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the firm generated $4.9 billion in net income for the first three months of the year, equivalent to 85 cents per share.</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s coronavirus vaccine, also dubbed BNT162b2, which is the most widely used of all approved vaccines in the USA, added $3.5 billion in revenues. The firm now anticipates $26 billion in sales from the product this year.</p>
<p>The experience working with BioNTech seems to have inspired a strategic shift from the New York-based pharma major, with chief executive Albert Bourla announcing plans to create more vaccines using mRNA technology.</p>
<p>Building on the success of Comirnaty, the firm aims to compete with established vaccines giants such as GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) to become a major player in this treatment setting.</p>
<h2>Strong financials</h2>
<p>Pfizer&rsquo;s work in combating the novel coronavirus was far from the only positive note in the firm&rsquo;s first quarter financial results, which reflected a strong performance across the board.</p>
<p>Global revenues from anticoagulant Eliquis (apixaban) were up by a quarter and sales of Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis) - oral transthyretin stabilizers used to prevent heart failure - up 88%.</p>
<p>Xeljanz (tofacitinib) revenues were also strong, coming in 18% higher on a global basis, primarily driven by 16% growth in the USA, due to higher volumes.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, Dr Bourla said: &ldquo;Even excluding the growth provided from BNT162b2, our revenues grew 8% operationally, which aligns with our stated goal of delivering at least a 6% compound annual growth rate through 2025.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;In addition, we have achieved important clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones across our pipeline and portfolio while also continuing to increase our capacity to supply urgently-needed doses of BNT162b2 to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pfizer raised its guidance ranges for 2021 revenues, to between $70.5 and $72.5 billion, up from between $59.4 and $61.4.</p>

<p>NovoBiome, which is focused on the nexus of liver, intestinal diseases and the gut microbiome, has been launched by a team of experts in the fields of microbiology and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><span class=""pullQuote"">""We are well-positioned to become a leader in discovering next-generation gut-liver therapies""</span>The company will develop breakthrough live biotherapeutics products (LBPs) targeting this axis while building a comprehensive, disruptive<em> ex-vivo</em> research and discovery platform to analyze the symbiotic relationship between the microbiota and the human intestine.</p>
<p>NovoBiome&rsquo;s first LBP drug candidate, ADC-001, targets potential first-in-class therapies for hepatic conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH).</p>
<p>NAFLD has become the most common cause of chronic liver diseases, and can lead to NASH, a more serious condition. Due to the growing epidemic of metabolic disorders with the development of Western lifestyles, the NASH market is rising rapidly and is expected to reach $18.3 billion by 2026 in the USA and Europe&rsquo;s five largest markets, a compound annual growth rate of 63% from 2016.</p>
<p>ADC-001 comprises an anti-inflammatory bacterium, member of the class <em>Coriobacteriia</em> that has demonstrated potent therapeutic effects <em>in vitro</em> and in animal models. It is currently in development with the aim of entering human trials by 2022 to 2023.</p>
<p>Pierre-Yves Mousset, chief executive of NovoBiome, said: &ldquo;The microbiome is a fast growing and disruptive field of research that has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of liver diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NovoBiome has been founded to exploit the broad potential of LBPs that target the critical microbiome-gut-liver axis.

<p>Sonelokimab has clinically demonstrated potential to drive disease modification in dermatology and rheumatology patients. Sonelokimab is a tri-specific, balanced interleukin (IL)-17A/F inhibitor with an albumin binding site, which has the potential to facilitate deep tissue penetration in the skin and joints.</p>
<p>Dr Kristian Reich, chief scientific officer and co-founder of MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, commented: &ldquo;Sonelokimab is a remarkable Nanobody with game-changing potential in the treatment of a range of IL-17A/F-driven inflammatory diseases.

<p>In biopsies taken at a median of 12 weeks and after only three doses, results from Part A of MOMENTUM study found that the 30mg/kg of SRP-5051 dosed monthly resulted in 18 times the exon skipping and eight times the dystrophin production as eteplirsen, dosed weekly for 24 weeks. Exon-skipping and dystrophin production in the 30mg/kg cohort were also consistently higher than the 20mg/kg cohort of MOMENTUM.</p>
<h2><strong>Adverse event reported, but seen as manageable</strong></h2>
<p>On the negative side, hypomagnesemia was identified in patients taking SRP-5051. Reduced magnesium levels, which can lead to heart damage and seizures, were observed in two of the four patients Sarepta reported data from. Executives said the side effect went away after the patients received oral magnesium, and believe that such supplements can keep the condition from occurring in the future.</p>
<p>RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote that the side effect is ""potentially manageable in [the] context of severe disease but may garner increased regulatory scrutiny.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to report strong, dose-dependent exon-skipping and dystrophin expression results with monthly dosing of SRP-5051 &ndash; in ambulant and non-ambulant patients. Even at an early timepoint of 12 weeks and after as few as only three doses, these data confirm the potential of Sarepta&rsquo;s next-generation PPMO platform to be a step order improvement over our current PMO platform, and to profoundly impact the course of Duchenne. While we saw exceptional expression after only a few initial doses, our models predict that we will exceed dystrophin expression levels of 10% of normal or greater over time with SRP-5051,&rdquo; said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta.</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;We are excited to have chosen our target dose for further development. Part A of MOMENTUM is now complete and Sarepta will work with great urgency to discuss the results with regulatory agencies and gain their insights, including the development path to support an accelerated approval of SRP-5051 in the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this goal in mind, Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) has agreed to supply up to half a billion doses of its vaccine to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance - a public&ndash;private global health partnership working on immunisation in lower-income countries.</p>
<p>The Cambridge, USA-based mRNA specialist recently announced it would invest in both owned and partnered manufacturing facilities to boost global supplies of its coronavirus vaccine next year, targeting production of up to three billion doses.</p>
<p>Chief executive St&eacute;phane Bancel said his firm supported &ldquo;COVAX&rsquo;s mission to ensure broad, affordable and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;we remain committed to doing everything that we can to ending this ongoing pandemic with our mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Vaccinating the world</h2>
<p>Gavi is one of several global health bodies leading the COVAX initiative, a project to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to support global access.</p>
<p>As countries such as the UK and USA prepare to vaccinate ever younger demographics, and with approval for certain vaccines in children expected imminently, there has been criticism that rich countries are not doing enough to combat the novel coronavirus in the developing world.</p>
<p>In the USA, there is no shortage of supplies of vaccine, with an estimated 65 million doses having been distributed but not yet administered, around half of which is from Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and around 25 million doses of which are from Moderna.</p>
<p>Moderna has agreed to supply Gavi with an initial 34 million doses to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021, providing an option on 466 million additional doses in 2022, with all doses offered at its lowest tiered price.</p>
<p>Gavi CEO Seth Berkley said: &ldquo;We are very pleased to sign this new agreement with Moderna, giving COVAX Facility participants access to yet another highly efficacious vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Expanding and having a diverse portfolio has always been a core goal for COVAX, and to remain adaptable in the face of this continually evolving pandemic &ndash; including the rising threat posed by new variants. This agreement is a further step in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferriprox is a synthetic, orally active iron-chelating agent shown to be effective in reducing iron concentration by penetrating cell membranes and removing toxic iron from organ tissues and extracellular fluids. Ferriprox is available as a 1000mg twice-a-day oral tablet.</p>

<p>First, Sandoz, a Novartis division, revealed progress in the late-stage clinical development program for its proposed biosimilar aflibercept. Sandoz will begin enrolling the first patient in MYLIGHT, a clinical Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study, shortly.</p>
<p>Aflibercept is indicated to improve visual acuity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema, macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, and other specific neovascular retinal diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;nAMD accounts for 10% of all age-related macular degeneration cases, but is responsible for 90% of AMD-related blindness,&rdquo; said Florian Bieber, global head of biopharmaceuticals development, Sandoz, adding: &ldquo;Aflibercept is a key treatment in ophthalmology. The initiation of this study marks an important milestone in the development of our biosimilar aflibercept. As with all our biosimilar programs, we aim to expand access to high-quality, more affordable biologics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MYLIGHT is part of a comprehensive biosimilar development program including analytical, pre-clinical and clinical data. The study aims to confirm that the proposed biosimilar has equivalent efficacy and comparable safety to the reference medicine in patients with nAMD.</p>

<p>Glenmark, one of the leaders in respiratory segment, has been the first to launch the branded generic version at an affordable cost for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in India. This will provide patients a far more convenient, cost effective treatment option in the country.</p>
<p>Glenmark is the first company in the world to launch Ryaltris-AZ, as a novel fixed-dose combination of mometasone furoate 50mcg + azelastine 140mcg.</p>
<p>The Indian firm has previously developed and marketed nasal spray Ryaltris (olopatadine and mometasone furoate), which is indicated for treatment of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).</p>
<p>According to a study, around 20%-30% of the Indian population suffers from allergic rhinitis. Moreover, in India, patients have to bear the drug cost on their own and so the price of the drug becomes a major factor that impacts treatment adherence.</p>
<p>While the average cost of therapy of top 10 existing brands of the similar drug category is 365 rupees ($4.93), Glenmark&rsquo;s Ryaltris-AZ nasal spray has been launched at a breakthrough price of 175 rupees per pack of 75 metered doses (MD).

<p>Speaking to media representatives, Dr Fauci said although they are still gaining data on a daily basis, the most recent data was looking at convalescent Sera of COVID-19 cases and people who received the vaccine used in India, the Covaxin. ""It was found to neutralize the 617 variants. So, despite the real difficulty that we are seeing in India, vaccination could be an especially important antidote against this,"" said Dr Fauci.</p>
<p>Developed by India's Bharat Biotech in partnership with the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3, while still in clinical trial. Later, trial results showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78%, for its ability to neutralize the B.1.617 variant, according to ICMR.</p>
<p>The B.1.617 variant, mostly found in COVID cases in Maharashtra and Delhi, has three new spike protein mutations. This variant is said to be pushing the deadly second COVID surge across India.</p>
<p>Dr Fauci also said that the world has failed to get together and help India avert the mammoth COVID crisis it is witnessing.</p>
<p>This, despite India's own vaccine diplomacy - India decided to ship out doses of the novel coronavirus vaccine to 'neighboring and key partner countries', with its vaccine diplomacy reaching 17 nations, including neighboring countries as well as those in West Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>
<p>India had earlier supplied hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir and paracetamol tablets, as well as ventilators, masks, and other medical supplies to a large number of countries to help them deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>As part of the GAVI-COVAX alliance, India is to supply 10 million doses to Africa and 1 million to UN health workers.</p>
<h2><strong>USA help being provided&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Given India&rsquo;s growing strategic importance, its rising wave of infections risks the fledgling recovery in Asia&rsquo;s third-largest economy. The nation is now termed the main hotspot of the pandemic, despite being home to the world&rsquo;s largest vaccine manufacturer.</p>
<p>On April 27, the USA said that it remembers 'India's generosity' in the early days of the pandemic and has decided to roll out a series of supportive measures to help India&rsquo;s fight against the COVID-19 upsurge.</p>
<p>The Biden administration&rsquo;s announcement was a dramatic policy U-turn and came after a tumultuous week in which the administration&rsquo;s carefully constructed pandemic-diplomacy plan fell apart as the COVID-19 crisis in India worsened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With pressure mounting on the US to give out vaccines to countries such as India, which is in the throes of a massive COVID-19 outbreak, the Biden administration maintained that the Indian government did not request it for ready-to-use vaccines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some time now US lawmakers and other influential voices have been calling for the US to donate its spare vaccines to countries like India, particularly some of the tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s (LSE: AZN) vaccine.</p>
<p>However, the Biden's administration has assured that India will be supplied with raw materials required by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) to ramp up the production of Covishield vaccines and has also identified supplies of other therapeutics that are to be immediately made available for India.</p>
<p>The tweets by Biden and Harris were the first reactions by the top American leadership after the recent outbreak of the pandemic in India. The two have been criticized by friends of India in the USA, including some of their own party leaders, for the slow response of American help to their natural ally.</p>
<p>Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna, and Member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the administration should also call on US pharma giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and biotech Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with the COVID-19 crisis. It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets, he added.</p>
<p>Others have argued the Biden administration needs to demonstrate a more agile approach in managing the pandemic globally and in navigating the domestic politics of foreign policy.</p>
<h2><strong>Help at hand</strong></h2>
<p>Chief executives of 40 top American companies have come together to create a global task force and mobilize resources to India. The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is also funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE, a Hyderabad-based firm, to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Additionally, the USA is deploying an expert team of public health advisors from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work in close collaboration with the US Embassy, India&rsquo;s health ministries, and India&rsquo;s Epidemic Intelligence Service staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>USAID will also quickly work with the CDC to support and fast-track the mobilization of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund. The USA has also decided to lift its embargo on the export of raw materials required by the Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce Covishield, as requested by SII CEO Adar Poonawall.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Export curbs</strong></h2>
<p>In February, the USA invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the power to control the distribution of products, to curb the export of raw materials critical for vaccine production.</p>
<p>USA blocked export because, in November last year, Pfizer cut short its vaccine production target by half, citing a shortage of raw material. Pfizer, which is producing mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, had earlier planned to roll out over 1.2 billion shots in 2021, but reduced the target by half due to raw material shortage in the USA and Europe.</p>
<p>Also, UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has gone on record to state that SII, India's main vaccine maker, is ""making and producing more doses of vaccine than any other single organization.""</p>","2021-05-04 10:10:00","Aiding India's vaccine efforts - diplomatically","India, COVID-19, Vaccines, Support, Pandemic, Biden administration, Bharat Biotech, Covaxin, Remdesivir, Serum Institute of India, AstraZeneca, Pfizer","Aiding India's vaccine efforts - diplomatically",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-03 11:20:33","2021-05-04 10:10:26",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/aiding-india-s-vaccine-efforts-diplomatically,,,,,,india_flag_big.jpg,india_flag_small.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Infectious diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Focus On, From our correspondent, In Depth, Public health","India, USA","AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India","Comirnaty, Covaxin, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

<p>In a sign of the firm&rsquo;s confidence in the product, the program comes ahead of any regulatory approvals having been secured for NVX-CoV2373, a vaccine which uses a traditional recombinant protein-based approach.</p>
<p>In January, the company released positive Phase III data which showed vaccine efficacy of 89.3% in trials conducted in the UK.</p>
<p>In mid-January, the firm initiated a rolling submission with the British medicines regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and is expected to use the UK-based data to secure an emergency approval in the USA.</p>
<p>R&amp;D president Gregory Glenn said: ""Through the expansion of our PREVENT-19 clinical trial, we hope to build upon the encouraging safety and efficacy data generated to-date in adults for our vaccine candidate and to play a significant global role in offering vaccination to as many people as possible across age groups to end the suffering caused by the pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Broadening use</h2>
<p>Bolstered by approvals for vaccines from Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA), AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Pfizer (NYSE: AZN) and others, vaccine coverage in some areas, including the USA and the UK, is increasingly widespread.</p>
<p>In this context, the need to extend coverage to include unvaccinated groups becomes more pressing, and many vaccine developers are rapidly collecting clinical data to support approvals in children.</p>
<p>To this end, Novavax will launch an additional arm of its ongoing PREVENT-19 trial, recruiting up to 3,000 adolescents aged 12 to 17 across up to 75 sites in the USA.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of volunteers will receive intramuscular injections of the vaccine and one-third will receive placebo, with participants being monitored for safety for up to two years following the final dose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the first vaccine to be approved, Pfizer and BioNTech&rsquo;s (Nasdaq: BNTX) Comirnaty, appears set to get the green light for use in 12 to 15 year olds in the USA, opening up the US campaign to millions more people.</p>

Both studies met their primary endpoints of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline for Beovu 6mg versus aflibercept 2mg at year one.</p>
<p>In KESTREL, patients on Beovu 6mg gained a mean of 9.2 letters versus 10.5 letters for patients on aflibercept 2mg. In KITE, patients on Beovu 6mg gained a mean of 10.6 letters versus 9.4 letters for patients on aflibercept 2mg.</p>
<p>In pre-specified secondary endpoints, fewer eyes treated with Beovu had intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid (IRF/SRF) at week 32 (first assessment of disease activity) and week 52 versus eyes treated with aflibercept. More eyes treated with Beovu 6mg than eyes treated with aflibercept achieved central subfield thickness (CSFT) levels below 280 &mu;m at weeks 32 and 52. Fluid is a key marker of disease activity in DME and CSFT is a key indicator of fluid in the retina.</p>
<p>Beovu injection was approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Europe in February last year, and for the same indication in the USA in October 2019.</p>
<h2><strong>Competition and sales forecasts</strong></h2>
<p>Beovu compete Regeneron (Nasdaq: REGN) and Bayer&rsquo;s (BAYN: DE) Eylea (aflibercept). The Evaluate group has suggested that Beovu has a net present value of $5.59 billion. GlobalData has previously forecast that, at its peak, Beovu can bring in between $4.1 billion and $7 billion in sales. At the same time, Eylea sales will likely drop from their peak of $2.6 billion to $1.5 billion by 2026, according to the data and analytics company.</p>
<p>Novartis is committed to bringing Beovu 6mg to market for DME patients, subject to regulatory approvals, and will be submitting these one-year data from the KESTREL and KITE trials to global health authorities in first-half 2021.

Also, AstraZeneca came out with results that pleased investors, as did Vertex Pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h2><strong>AstraZeneca and Sanofi&rsquo;s RSV jab takes a step towards market</strong></h2>
<p>Several big pharma names are in late-stage development with novel projects designed to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infections, and <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/nirsevimab-shows-positive-protective-profile-in-rsv"">AstraZeneca and Sanofi</a> confirmed that they are in pole position. Nirsevimab, a long-acting antibody, succeeded in the pivotal MELODY trial, putting the project on track for regulatory filings next year, commented Amy Brown writing on Evaluate Vantage.</p>
<p>Biopharma has struggled for years to come up with something better than Synagis, which is only available to high-risk infants, so this clinical win is notable. But developers are hoping to convince healthcare systems that RSV prevention should be made available to all infants, and winning that argument could be difficult.</p>
<p>This is likely to be especially true in cost-sensitive regions, and of course nirsevimab&rsquo;s ultimate commercial potential will depend on AstraZeneca and Sanofi pitching the right price. It is too early to discuss those details, Tonya Villafana, head of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s global infections franchise, told Evaluate Vantage, while insisting that the project will prove cost effective for many countries.</p>
<p>Ms Villafana rejects the suggestion that nirsevimab could end up being used mainly in regions with loose payer restrictions. &ldquo;There is a lot of interest [in the project]; we have even talked to the World Health Organization, which sees the value,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Another potential challenger could come from vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, both of which are in pivotal trials (<a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/analysis/spotlight/glaxo-moves-place-rsv-treatment-race"">Glaxo moves up a place in the RSV treatment race</a><em>, November 26, 2020</em>). Numerous failures in this space means that these projects&rsquo; success is far from guaranteed, and both companies will be facing the challenge of running pivotal programs at a time when social distancing is lowering rates of respiratory infections.</p>
<h2><strong>A tale of two PD-1s. or are all threatened?</strong></h2>
<p>Covid-19 caused sales of <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-co-comes-up-short-in-sales-and-earnings"">Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s</a> Keytruda and <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/bigger-bristol-myers-powers-ahead-in-first-quarter"">Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s</a> Opdivo to slip slightly quarter on quarter, but for Bristol the year-over-year view is more concerning, according to Jacob Plieth and Edwin Elmhirst on Evaluate Vantage. This shows a 3% Opdivo decline versus Keytruda&rsquo;s muscular 19% growth, and Opdivo revenue has in fact flatlined over the past 10 quarters. Nevertheless, on its quarterly call Bristol said it was &ldquo;very excited&rdquo; about Opdivo&rsquo;s prospects, seeing limited risk of commoditisation from new anti-PD-(L)1 entrants, and saying the areas of greatest risk did not overlap with its <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/events/conferences/asco-gu-bristol-pole-position-opdivos-adjuvant-use"">largest markets</a>. According to <em>Evaluate Pharma</em>&nbsp;sell-side consensus Keytruda and Opdivo will grow 11-12% a year to hit $28.7bn and $14.8bn respectively in 2026, likely driven by adjuvant/neoadjuvant. Merck&rsquo;s party will not last forever either, though this&nbsp;company has played up new formulations, combinations and perioperative uses, and said it &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t see a [post-2030] cliff as the Street does&rdquo;. Still, competition is a hot issue. On Tuesday Lilly was asked whether it might compete on price with Tyvyt, and said it was &ldquo;looking at ways to differentiate.&rdquo; And Bernstein&rsquo;s Ronny Gal has written an open letter to Regeneron, urging the group to make its own laggard, Libtayo, the first discounted anti-PD-1.</p>
<h2><strong>AstraZeneca&rsquo;Q1 trading results</strong></h2>
<p>As one of the world&rsquo;s most discussed companies in recent months, it is no surprise that AstraZeneca has delivered a strong set of results for the <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/soriot-s-ship-stays-the-course-in-first-quarter"">first quarter this year</a>, commented Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group. The company delivered significant revenue growth of 15% in the quarter to $7,320 million, excluding the contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Product Sales grew by 15% to $7,257 million, driven primarily by the performances of new medicines across Oncology and BioPharmaceutical. This included sales of Tagrisso, its new revolutionary cancer drug.</p>
<p>Globally, new medicines represented 53% of total revenue (Q1 2020: 47%). Q1 2020 benefitted from a low-to-mid single-digit percentage increase in sales following short-term inventory increases in the distribution channel, an indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company saw a significant increase in its emerging markets business with 14% growth to $2,592 million. In the USA, total revenue increased by 10% to $2,310 million and in Europe by 28% to $1,546 million.</p>
<p>With worldwide inoculations likely to accelerate over the next few months, signs for AstraZeneca are positive. As the impact of the pandemic begins to dissipate the company anticipates an acceleration of performance for the second half of 2021. Having delivered one of the most important vaccines in human history, it is no surprise that the company has delivered such a solid set of results. In addition, with non-COVID medication making up a significant portion of this growth, the company is well-positioned for a high-growth year as 2021 continues, Mr Shah concluded.</p>
<p>Meantime, Evaluate Vantages&rsquo; Amy Brown noted that AstraZeneca on Friday also confirmed a substantial delay for the US filing of its Covid-19 vaccine, saying this would&nbsp;be made ""within weeks."" The first half of April had been the initial target. Astra's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, denied that there were problems, saying it was simply taking time to gather the huge package, which will encompass ex-US trials and real-world data. Speaking on a media call, executives said AZD1222 (now trade-named Vaxzevria) would be travelling down an emergency use authorization route, although they will submit a full BLA if required. Given that the US has few vaccine supply problems, this longer path cannot be ruled out. This questions the logic of pursuing USA approval in the first place, but the importance of the FDA&rsquo;s validation can probably not be overstated in the wake of <a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/analysis/vantage-views/europe-needs-be-clearer-about-covid-19-vaccines"">concerns over lack of safety</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/analysis/vantage-views/obfuscation-and-evasion-astra-shows-how-not-disclose-data"">controversial data disclosures</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Solid Trikafta-driven beat in CF for Vertex</strong></h2>
<p>Last Thursday, <a href=""https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/vertex-reports-strong-1st-qtr-sales-growth"">Vertex reported first results</a> that demonstrated the resilience of the cystic fibrosis franchise, even in the midst of a difficult season for diversified biopharmas, noted SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.</p>
<p>Most biopharma franchises have faced headwinds this quarter related to COVID-19, pricing, and inventory drawdowns, and Vertex is one of the few to have delivered a genuine revenue and earnings beat, as well as maintaining a positive outlook for the year. However, investors are unlikely to give the company very much credit for the result as the company and investors have shifted their focus towards the catalysts from the company&rsquo;s early-stage pipeline and the potential for further business development activity.</p>
<p>The controversial AATD Phase I/II trial readout should be disclosed in the next few weeks, and is unlikely to be impaired by safety considerations, given the completion of dosing in the trial. However, it seems unlikely that the biomarker and efficacy results will be sufficiently definitive to declare that the product has the efficacy to drive a reversion in the share price to its previous heights. Instead, this study could invite further studies to optimize dosing and endpoints, before the program advances to a pivotal trial. Vertex&rsquo; recent increased investment in CRISPR&rsquo;s CTX001 has naturally triggered increased investor and analyst interest, but the controversies about that program&rsquo;s commercial value are unlikely to be resolved for a year or more (safety in more patients, durability of benefit, economic value/pricing).</p>
<p>Orkambi also beat expectations; the therapy is declining as patients switch to Trikafta, but the decline has been slower than analyst expectations. For the full-year 2021, Leerink lowered Orkambi (-8% versus previous estimate), Kalydeco (-2%), and Symdeko (-22%) for a total decrease of ~$217 million across those products. Leerink increased Trikafta revenue by $200 million or 4% compared to its previous estimate, leaving the 2021 revenue forecast essentially unchanged. Leerink&rsquo;s total revenue forecast increased slightly by 0%-2% versus previous estimates for 2022-2025, driven by boosts to our Trikafta forecast.&nbsp;</p>","2021-05-02 11:07:00","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 30, 2021","News review, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Nirsevimab, Bristol Myers Squibb, Opdivo, Meerck & Co, Keytruda, AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Vertex, Trikafta","Look back at pharma news in the week to April 30, 2021",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-02 11:01:57","2021-05-02 11:18:24",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/look-back-at-pharma-news-in-the-week-to-april-30-2021,,,,,,tpl-week-in-review-700x466.png,tpl-week-in-review-300x200.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,"Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical","Anti-virals, Immuno-oncology, Infectious diseases, Rare diseases, Vaccines","Coronavirus, Drug Trial, Financial, Focus On, Research",,"AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co, Sanofi, Vertex Pharmaceuticals","Keytruda, nirsevimab, Opdivo, Trikafta, Vaxzevria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article

488516,,"FDA approves treatment for chronic kidney disease","The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Farxiga (dapagliflozin) oral tablets to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression.","<p>The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Farxiga (dapagliflozin) oral tablets to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FDA granted the approval of Farxiga to Anglo-Swedish pharma major AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN). Farxiga, which was originally approved in 2014 to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in addition to diet and exercise, is the first SGLT2 inhibitor proven to significantly prolong the survival of patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca beat Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s SGLT2 rival Jardiance (empagliflozin) in gaining approval for this indication, as the US/Germany pair are not expected to provide Jardiance data in the kidney disease setting until next year.</p>
<h2><strong>Competition</strong></h2>
<p>In the meantime, Farxiga, which generated sales of $1.96 billion in its current indications last year and $691 million in the first quarter of 2021, will compete with Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s own SGLT2 drug, Invokana (canagliflozin), which has approval in diabetic kidney disease, although not in kidney disease patients without diabetes.</p>
<p>The co-chair of the DAPA-CKD trial and its executive committee, Prof Hiddo Heerspink, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, said: &ldquo;Based on the unprecedented results of the DAPA-CKD trial, dapagliflozin is now the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease regardless of diabetes status. This transformational milestone provides patients and physicians with a new and effective treatment option for this often debilitating and life-threatening disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mene Pangalos, executive vice president, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D at AstraZeneca, said: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s approval is the most significant advancement in the treatment of chronic kidney disease in more than 20 years. We&rsquo;ve shown impressive efficacy for Farxiga in type-2 diabetes, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and, most recently, chronic kidney disease and we are thrilled to be able to bring this medicine to millions of patients in the US.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Clinical backing</strong></h2>
<p>The efficacy of Farxiga to improve kidney outcomes and reduce cardiovascular death in patients with chronic kidney disease was evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind study. In this study, 4,304 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Farxiga or a placebo. The study compared the two groups for the number of patients whose disease progressed to a composite (or combined) endpoint that included at least a 50% reduction in kidney function, progression to kidney failure, or cardiovascular or kidney death.</p>
<p>Results showed that 197 of the 2,152 patients who received Farxiga had at least one of the composite endpoint events compared to 312 of the 2,152 patients who received a placebo. The study also compared the two groups for the number of patients who were hospitalized for heart failure or died from cardiovascular disease. A total of 100 patients who received Farxiga were hospitalized or died compared to 138 patients who received a placebo.</p>","2021-05-01 14:47:00","FDA approves treatment for chronic kidney disease","AstraZeneca, Farxiga, Kidney disease, Chronic, Approval, FDA","FDA approves treatment for chronic kidney disease",,1,,1,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-01 14:44:40","2021-05-01 15:00:50",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/fda-approves-treatment-for-chronic-kidney-disease,,,,,,astrazeneca_big-1.jpg,astrazeneca_small-2.jpg,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Pharmaceutical,"Diabetes, Nephrology and Hepatology","Focus On, Regulation, US FDA","UK, USA",AstraZeneca,Farxiga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
488515,,"Cancer drug Lorviqua granted ‘Innovation Passport’ from UK regulator","A UK Innovation Passport has been granted for a proposed new indication in the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor for Lorviqua (lorlatinib).","<p>A UK Innovation Passport has been granted for a proposed new indication in the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor for US pharma giant Pfizer&rsquo;s (NYSE: PFE) Lorviqua (lorlatinib).</p>
<p>The Innovation Passport is the entry point to The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&rsquo;s (MHRA) new Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP), intended to offer regulatory support and flexibilities to bring new medicines to UK patients more quickly.</p>
<p>Lorlatinib is a third-generation ALK inhibitor, specifically designed to inhibit the most common tumor mutations that drive resistance to current medications and to address metastases in the brain, a frequent site for disease progression in ALK-positive NSCLC. Up to 40% of people with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC present with brain metastases at initial diagnosis.</p>
<p>Lorlatinib is currently licenced and available on the National Health Service to treat adult patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, after alectinib or ceritinib or after crizotinib and at least 1 other ALK inhibitor. This innovation passport is part of a new regulatory submission to use lorlatinib earlier in the treatment pathway. In the UK, there are over 47,000 diagnoses of lung cancer, and NSCLC makes up the majority (87%) of all cases in England and Wales every year, according to Pfizer.</p>
<p>Last month, lorlatinib was granted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) by the US Food and Drug Administration expanding the indication for ALK-positive NSCLC, under the trade name Lorbrena. Approval was based on the CROWN trial, which showed a 72% reduction in risk of progression or death for treatment with lorlatinib versus crizotinib in a previously-untreated patient population.</p>","2021-05-01 14:01:00","Cancer drug Lorviqua granted ‘Innovation Passport’ from UK regulator","Pfizer, Lorviqua, Cancer, Lung, NSCLC, Innovation passport, MHRA, Lorbrena","Cancer drug Lorviqua granted ‘Innovation Passport’ from UK regulator",,1,,3,0,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00",1,"2021-05-01 14:00:45","2021-05-01 14:07:42",,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cancer-drug-lorviqua-granted-innovation-passport-from-uk-regulator,,,,,,mhra_large.png,mhra_small.png,0,0,,,0,,,0,,Biotechnology,Oncology,"Focus On, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Regulation","UK, USA",Pfizer,"Lorbrena, Lorviqua",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article
