Yet, there had been challenges regarding its global rollout. One of the challenges concerns the stability of supply. For example, India, one of the countries who manufactured the vaccine stopped it's export to other countries when it prioritised domestic use of the vaccine as a result of a surge in cases. The UK, another country which manufactured the vaccine, also had problems meeting its contracted demands from the EU, which led to legal actions taken from the EU against the UK. Another challenge regarding the rollout of the vaccine stemmed from safety concerns. There was news that reported a possibility that the Astrazeneca vaccien gave rise to blood clots. This potential health risk of the vaccine led to a halt to the use of the vaccine in some countries. Finally, despite these challenges, financially, the vaccine had led to an increase in share price and revenue of the company which developed the vaccine. \r\n", "task_condition": "viz", "task_key": "astrazeneca", "task_level": "post_graduate_phd", "time_taken_in_seconds": 1278558}}}
