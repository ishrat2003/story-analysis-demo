additional protection against the virus and incoming strains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nThe new jab has been criticised by some Tory backbenchers as being less than effective with the order being premature against the nation's continuing rollout of Moderna, Astrazenica, and Moderna vaccines. Some statisticians and polling data such as LuckyData have suggested that few would be willing to take a booster jab so early after their own vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe order of 24 million booster jabs will cost the UK economy upwards of \u00c2\u00a388 million will only providing an increase of 72% effectiveness in the elderly and an estimated 43% in children.
