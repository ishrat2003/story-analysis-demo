The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine on a two-dose schedule approximately 21 days apart in three age groups: children aged five to 11 years, two to five years, and six months to two years. The five to 11 year-old cohort started dosing last week and the companies plan to initiate the two to five year-old cohort next week.\r\nIn patients aged 12 to 15 years with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust antibody responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated.\r\nAlbert Bourla, chairman and chief executive, Pfizer, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe share the urgency to expand the authorization of our vaccine to use in younger populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15.\r\n Bourla said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe plan to submit these data to US Food and Drug Administration as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nUgur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAcross the globe, we are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children. The initial results we have seen in the adolescent studies suggest that children are particularly well-protected by vaccination, which is very encouraging given the trends we have seen in recent weeks regarding the spread of the B117 UK variant.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very important to enable them to get back to everyday school life and to meet friends and family while protecting them and their loved ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nA month later Pfizer said that it has acquired San Diego-based Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held biotech dedicated to the development of therapies for debilitating and life-threatening diseases that affect people with compromised immune systems. Amplyx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lead compound, fosmanogepix, is a novel investigational asset under development for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. \r\nIn addition to fosmanogepix, Pfizer acquires Amplyx' early-stage pipeline, including potential antiviral (MAU868) and antifungal (APX2039) therapies. MAU868, licensed from Novartis (NOVN: VX), is a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody with activity against the BK virus. \r\nThus, it is pretty obvious that the campaign against Covid-19 turned out to be a great economical opportunity for Pfizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "task_condition": "text", "task_key": "pfizer", "task_level": "post_graduate_phd", "time_taken_in_seconds": 162441}, "astrazeneca": {"story_term": "astrazeneca", "user_code": "GOLD_20", "age_group": "21_30", "agreed": true, "close_date_time": "2021-10-25 9:10:3", "close_timestamp": 1637831403801, "created": "25/11/2021 09:10:01", "department": "English and Creative Literature", "disability": false, "ease": 3, "environment": "production", "experiment_date_datepicker": "2021-11-25", "gender": "male", "id": "88c119ab-e76e-4a12-8931-870fed9a8df7", "open_date_time": "2021-10-25 8:53:3", "open_timestamp": 1637830383612, "summary": "The first of many millions of doses of AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccine have begun arriving in low and middle-income countries across the world through the multilateral COVAX initiative, the first steps in fulfilling the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to provide broad and equitable access to the vaccine. With its partner, the Serum Institute of India, the Anglo-Swedish drug major says it will become the biggest supplier to COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to vaccines for the novel coronavirus for all countries, regardless of income levels, which is led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. First COVAX shipments were dispatched late last week to Ghana and Cote D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ivoire, and more are due to begin arriving this week in countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Fiji, Mongolia and Moldova. This supply represents the first COVID-19 vaccine for many of these countries. AstraZeneca was the first global pharmaceutical company to join COVAX in June 2020 in line with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared commitment to global, equitable access to vaccines. Further shipments will arrive in the coming weeks with the aim of supplying a total of 142 countries with hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine in the coming months. The majority of these doses, manufactured by AstraZeneca and its licence partner Serum Institute of India, will go to low and middle-income countries. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of Astra Zeneca, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese first steps towards fulfilling our broad, equitable and no-profit emergency response to the pandemic mean millions of people, irrespective of their country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income level, will soon be protected against this deadly virus. This is a moment of great pride for us at AstraZeneca and I am extremely grateful to our partners including Gavi, CEPI and Oxford University for their hard work and dedication in order to make this humanitarian ideal a reality for many millions of people around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlobal, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines is only possible when the public and private sectors work together. When we launched the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment in June 2020, our first agreement was with AstraZeneca. Nine months later, the first doses are already being delivered to those that need them most. This is the beginning of COVAX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to end the acute phase of the pandemic, not the end, but we can all take strength from this moment and I thank AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for their support and partnership at every step of our journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nIs COVAX really capable of delivering the vaccines though? \r\n\r\nThe European Commission is reportedly asking the 27 EU member states to back litigation against the British firm, which it says is in breach of contractual obligations to supply the product. AstraZeneca has said it inked a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest efforts\u00e2\u0080\u009d contract with Europe, and that supply chain disruptions prevented it from supplying the estimated amount. While Europe has received just 30 million doses, the UK has used an exclusive arrangement with the drugmaker, agreed early on in the development of the product, to vaccinate a far larger share of its population. AstraZeneca is accused of \u00e2\u0080\u009cvaccine nationalism\u00e2\u0080\u009d given the fact that mainly supplies the Uk. If the company cannot even provide vaccines to the Eu, can deliver them to the rest of the world?\r\n\r\nWhile the EU fight to secure supplies of AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine, several countries have restricted its use to older populations amid concerns over a rare side effect of blood clotting. Scientists are unclear whether a small number of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) cases are linked to the use of the viral vector-based product, partly due to uncertainty over how widespread the rare condition is among the general population. There have been over 20 million doses of the product given in the UK, and public health authorities around the world have confirmed the vaccine to be safe and effective. In a statement, the MHRA said: \"On the basis of this ongoing review, the advice remains that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The agency has, however, recommended that people under 30 be offered an alternative type of vaccine.", "task_condition": "viz", "task_key": "astrazeneca", "task_level": "post_graduate_phd", "time_taken_in_seconds": 1020189}}}
