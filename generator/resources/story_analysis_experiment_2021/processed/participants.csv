GOLD_1,21_30,Computing,False,female,Both text and visualisation were difficult;,2,1,"Failed to understand relation between  words. Labeling could be useful. Although didn't used multiple document visualization during task, she thinks that along with the text, it can help to understand emphasis. The text itself was not answering all the information required. She based her story based on previous knowledge Decided not to use the local context visualization in multiple document task as it was difficult in first 2 test sets. Complained about terms in both visualization and filtering. Parts of speech labels for LC hasn't loaded correctly in the browser. Biased on previous knowledge."
