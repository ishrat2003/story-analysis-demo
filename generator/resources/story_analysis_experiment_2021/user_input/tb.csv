Pfizer, a leading developer of coronavirus vaccines, has made tremendous progress by achieving a force-shield against the myriad strains of the COVID-19 virus. 
In March of this year, the mRNA-based vaccine had proven to be effective in resisting the highly contagious P1 variant that spread throughout Brazil, despite the variants resistance and transmissibility. A recent study by the Public Health England (PHE) showed that Pfizer provided 88% protection against the B.1.617.2 variant, or the Indian variant, two weeks after a second dose, while protection afforded by two doses of Vaxzevria, from AstraZeneca, was about 60% against this strain after two weeks.
In its aim to prevent infection of the virus, the vaccine has not only fulfilled its primary function but also resisted mutated forms of the same.

UK ministers last Tuesday approved the order of new Pfizer COVID-19 drug Hyperventol for the nation in a move which has been deemed premature and naive by some Tory MPs.

Commenting on the booster jab British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the evidence was “effective and important for the British public and our NHS,” adding: “We can now be unshakeably confident that over 24 million people – more than one in three – will have additional protection against the virus and incoming strains.”

The new jab has been criticised by some Tory backbenchers as being less than effective with the order being premature against the nation's continuing rollout of Moderna, Astrazenica, and Moderna vaccines. Some statisticians and polling data such as LuckyData have suggested that few would be willing to take a booster jab so early after their own vaccines.

The order of 24 million booster jabs will cost the UK economy upwards of £88 million will only providing an increase of 72% effectiveness in the elderly and an estimated 43% in children.

The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine on a two-dose schedule approximately 21 days apart in three age groups: children aged five to 11 years, two to five years, and six months to two years. The five to 11 year-old cohort started dosing last week and the companies plan to initiate the two to five year-old cohort next week.
In patients aged 12 to 15 years with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust antibody responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated.
Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive, Pfizer, said: “We share the urgency to expand the authorization of our vaccine to use in younger populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15.
 Bourla said: “We plan to submit these data to US Food and Drug Administration as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.”
Ugur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech, said: “Across the globe, we are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children. The initial results we have seen in the adolescent studies suggest that children are particularly well-protected by vaccination, which is very encouraging given the trends we have seen in recent weeks regarding the spread of the B117 UK variant.
“It is very important to enable them to get back to everyday school life and to meet friends and family while protecting them and their loved ones.”

A month later Pfizer said that it has acquired San Diego-based Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held biotech dedicated to the development of therapies for debilitating and life-threatening diseases that affect people with compromised immune systems. Amplyx’ lead compound, fosmanogepix, is a novel investigational asset under development for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. 
In addition to fosmanogepix, Pfizer acquires Amplyx' early-stage pipeline, including potential antiviral (MAU868) and antifungal (APX2039) therapies. MAU868, licensed from Novartis (NOVN: VX), is a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody with activity against the BK virus. 
Thus, it is pretty obvious that the campaign against Covid-19 turned out to be a great economical opportunity for Pfizer.

There has been a rich collection of data showing its efficacy such as how research has shown that the vaccine can extend to 31 days while being stored which will help preserve it longer and easier. Further research has also shown its robust effectiveness across an Indian strain of COVID-19, which was stronger than the AstraZeneca vaccine.This shows how Pfizer has been one of the worlds leading vaccines.

What else are these companies doing on a strategic level to expand their business and how has the covid pandemic impacted the industry in general?

“The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder of the devastating impact of infectious diseases, highlighting the continuous need for new anti-infective therapies to treat both emerging and difficult to treat bacterial, viral and fungal infections,” said Angela Lukin, global president, Pfizer Hospital.
This might have positively impacted Pfizer's efforts to expand its business outside of covid related treatments.

In addition to its acquisition of Amplyx Pharmaceuticals in 2021 and latest acquisition of Arixa Pharmaceuticals, ""a company making a next-generation oral antibiotic, ARX-1796, that, if approved, would be one of the first new drugs of its kind in 35 years"", it is also going into license agreements such as with ""US biotech Celcuity (Nasdaq: CELC) to acquire exclusive rights to the US pharma giant’s gedatolisib, a Phase Ib pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor2 as well as ""Pyxis Oncology for the development and commercialisation of two antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) candidates and a license to Pfizer's ADC technology platform.""
Also, ""China’s WuXi Biologics (HK: 2269) has entered into an equity agreement with US pharma giant Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) China subsidiary to acquire its state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facilities, as well as its labor force in Hangzhou, China.""

Potentially, the success of companies such as Pfizer and the general attention to biotech has also ignited the risk-taking willingness in the industry's m&a market in general.
Despite Pfizer's takeover of Amplyx Pharmaceuticals there have been at least 11 other acquisitions this year reaching from a few million $ to acquire a final set of company shares to several billion. At least 11 mergers have been accomplished this year by mid may.

But for younger age groups it was more finely balanced."",  says Dr June Raine. Still, those complications have lead to a decrease in vaccination speed in several countries, which has benefited the spread of the often deadly virus further. This should lead to a serious conversation about how risks of health treatments are presented in a public discourse.","viz","astrazeneca","post_graduate_ma_msc","1903448"

With its partner, the Serum Institute of India, the Anglo-Swedish drug major says it will become the biggest supplier to COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to vaccines for the novel coronavirus for all countries, regardless of income levels, which is led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. First COVAX shipments were dispatched late last week to Ghana and Cote D’Ivoire, and more are due to begin arriving this week in countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Fiji, Mongolia and Moldova. This supply represents the first COVID-19 vaccine for many of these countries. AstraZeneca was the first global pharmaceutical company to join COVAX in June 2020 in line with the company’s shared commitment to global, equitable access to vaccines. Further shipments will arrive in the coming weeks with the aim of supplying a total of 142 countries with hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine in the coming months. The majority of these doses, manufactured by AstraZeneca and its licence partner Serum Institute of India, will go to low and middle-income countries. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of Astra Zeneca, said: “These first steps towards fulfilling our broad, equitable and no-profit emergency response to the pandemic mean millions of people, irrespective of their country’s income level, will soon be protected against this deadly virus. This is a moment of great pride for us at AstraZeneca and I am extremely grateful to our partners including Gavi, CEPI and Oxford University for their hard work and dedication in order to make this humanitarian ideal a reality for many millions of people around the world.” Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, said: “Global, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines is only possible when the public and private sectors work together. When we launched the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment in June 2020, our first agreement was with AstraZeneca. Nine months later, the first doses are already being delivered to those that need them most. This is the beginning of COVAX’s effort to end the acute phase of the pandemic, not the end, but we can all take strength from this moment and I thank AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for their support and partnership at every step of our journey.”

Is COVAX really capable of delivering the vaccines though? 

The European Commission is reportedly asking the 27 EU member states to back litigation against the British firm, which it says is in breach of contractual obligations to supply the product. AstraZeneca has said it inked a so-called “best efforts” contract with Europe, and that supply chain disruptions prevented it from supplying the estimated amount. While Europe has received just 30 million doses, the UK has used an exclusive arrangement with the drugmaker, agreed early on in the development of the product, to vaccinate a far larger share of its population. AstraZeneca is accused of “vaccine nationalism” given the fact that mainly supplies the Uk. If the company cannot even provide vaccines to the Eu, can deliver them to the rest of the world?

While the EU fight to secure supplies of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, several countries have restricted its use to older populations amid concerns over a rare side effect of blood clotting. Scientists are unclear whether a small number of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) cases are linked to the use of the viral vector-based product, partly due to uncertainty over how widespread the rare condition is among the general population. There have been over 20 million doses of the product given in the UK, and public health authorities around the world have confirmed the vaccine to be safe and effective. In a statement, the MHRA said: ""On the basis of this ongoing review, the advice remains that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people.” The agency has, however, recommended that people under 30 be offered an alternative type of vaccine.","viz","astrazeneca","post_graduate_phd","1020189"

AstraZeneca has developed one of the most important vaccines in human history and has therefore , understandably, been one of the most discussed companies in the past months. The company has gained a lot of investor trust and a spectacular financial sheet which allows it to take further risks with other medication outside of covid.  This can be seen in the fact that excluding the contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine ""the company delivered significant revenue growth of 15% in the quarter to $7,320 million"".

AstraZeneca has no better means to invest in rare disease medication. ""Rare diseases is also a high-growth therapy area with a high level of unmet medical need. With over 7,000 rare diseases currently known about, just 5% currently have FDA-approved treatments.""
With its new revenue and investor trust generated from covid related vaccines, AstraZeneca is able to diversify its portfolio by buying for example American rare disease specialist Alexion Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ALXN) at $39 billion.

""The acquisition, which would add a portfolio of five approved therapies as well as a pipeline of more than twice that number of candidates, has already been approved by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).""

More investment into these areas and higher investor trust in the company can lead to higher outcomes in finding effective treatments for rare diseases, something that would have been more difficult with the lack of trust, interest and agglomerated capital in the company before covid.
