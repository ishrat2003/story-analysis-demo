Not well read but readable. Lot of colours to keep track With time it became easy to interpret in the multiple document task.   GOLD_2 (Task set C and D) Finding difficult to formulate a strategic plan. Looks like finding the text difficult to interpret when presented only a list of documents even all of the document belong to a specific topic. Had a tendency to neglect visualization as new tool. As we are contrasting c vs d. We told to use the visualization to reach documents. Cricle was difficult to interpret. It wasn't a statistical visualization but there was a tendency to understand it as a statistical visualization.  Little bit difficult at the beginning but at the end found it beneficial for writing  Not familiar with non statistical visualization. Have seen it for the first time.

She also agreed that she had the effect of the TB board while doing the list of  documents task without viz.  Visualization was good for task C, D when creating domain based story not literature story. Liked action  and sentiment categorization. Helped to think. Doesn't help to think through with emotions or feelings for story. Saves time. Found the visualization hard at the beginning but became familiar by the end of the task. Used previous knowledge  Liked the visualization later Personally avoid data visualization but with usages these visualization will be easy to use. Getting used to it"

He didn't want to understand it. The participant seemed to look at it as an idea point of view. The participant used the visualization as a creative tool. Less contextual details. Without context will be difficult interpret. For longer text LC viz will be better for finding emphasis. It will be good to add contextual details (the sentences having the term on clicking or hovering over the term.)    GOLD_7 (Task set C and D) This participant understood what a story is. I think participant understood the task better. He got the idea that, he should have at least one from each ball Vizualization made easy and helpful to an overview of the status if the terms are chosen correctly. When landing to terms from the historical bubble, should not include resent articles. When landing to terms from the latest bubble, should not include resent articles. Relation filter should not be inclusive, it should be exclusive The visualization is easy but the algorithm that is getting the term needs to be improved. The relation should show contextual details. TB visualization worked well for summarization but not for idea generation in his case. Liked TB. But didn't helped him for finding an attitude and idea generation without opinion context. "
